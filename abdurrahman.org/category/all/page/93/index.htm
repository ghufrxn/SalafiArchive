By Allah, it is not the poverty about which I fear in regard to you but I am afraid in your case that (the worldly) riches way be given to you as were given to those who had gone before you and you begin to vie with one another for them as they vied for them. and these may destroy you as these destroyed them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira, narrated that he heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There were three persons in Bani Isra&#8217;il, one suffering from leprosy, the other bald-headed and the third one blind. Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

When Sa&#8217;d saw him he said: I seek refuge with Allah from the mischief of this rider.

(How strange it is) that now the people of Banu Asad (the progeny of Zubair) instruct me in religion and try to impose punishment upon me (in regard to it).

Ghazwan delivered us a sermon and he praised Allah and lauded Him, then said: Now coming to the point, verily the world has been given the news of its end and that too quite early. Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa&#8217;d b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa&#8217;d make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).</p>

They said: No. He again said: Do you feel any difficulty in seeing the moon on the fourteenth night when there is no cloud over it? They said: No. Thereupon he said: By Allah Who is One in Whose Hand is my life. you will not face any difficulty in seeing your Lord but only so much as you feel in seeing one of them. Then Allah would sit in judgment upon the servant and would say: O, so and so, did I not honour you and make you the chief and provide you the spouse and subdue for you horses, camels, and afforded you an opportunity to rule over your subjects? He would say: Yes. And then it would be said: Did you not think that you would meet Us? And he would say: No. Thereupon He (Allah) would say: Well, We forget you as you forgot Us. Then the second person would be brought for judgment. (And Allah would) say: 0, so and so. did We not honour you and make you the chief and make you pair and subdue for you horses and camels and afford you an opportunity to rule over your subjects? He would say: Yes, my Lord. And He (the Lord) would say: Did you not think that you would be meeting Us? And he would say: No. And then He (Allah) would say: Well, I forget you today as you forgot Us. Then the third -one would be brought and He (Allah) would say to him as He said before. And he (the third person) would say: O, my Lord, I affirmed my faith in Thee and in Thy Book and in Thy Messenger and I observed prayer and fasts and gave charity, and he would speak in good terms like this as he would be able to do. And He (Allah) would say: Well, We will bring our witnesses to you. And the man would think in his mind who would bear witness upon him and then his mouth would be sealed and it would be said to his thighs, to his flesh and to his bones to speak and his thighs. flesh and bones would bear witness to his deeds and it would be done so that he should not be able to make any excuse for himself and he would be a hypocrite and Allah would be annoyed with him.</p>

He would say: My Lord, have you not guaranteed me protection against injustice? He would say: Yes. Then the servant would say: I do not deem valid any witness against me but my own self, and He would say: Well, enough would he the witness of your self against you and that of the two angels who had been appointed to record your deeds. Then the seal would be set upon his mouth and it would be said to his hands and feet to speak and they would speak of his deeds.

Thereupon he said: Do you think that I have not talked to him but that I have made you hear? By Allah. I have talked to him (about things) concerning me and him and I did not like to divulge those things about which I had to take the initiative and I do not say to my ruler:&#8221; You are the best among people,&#8221; after I beard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in Hell-Fire and his intestines will pour forth in Hell and he will go round along with them, as an ass goes round the mill. stone. The denizens of Hell would gather round him and say: 0, so and so, what has happened to you? Were you not enjoining us to do what was reputable and forbid us to do what was disreputable? He will say: Of course, it is so; I used to enjoin (upon people) to do what was reputable but did not practise that myself. I had been forbidding people to do what was disreputable, but practised it myself.</p>

He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7149"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father (&#8216;Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to &#8216;Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

She came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and (informed him about it). Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet) said: Did you squeeze it? She said: Yes.

He offered the noon and afternoon prayers together and the sunset and night prayers together and on the other day he deferred the prayers; he then came out and offered the noon and afternoon prayers together. He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating well the gardens.</p>

So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Uqba b. &#8216;Amir reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) one day went out and he offered prayer over the martyrs of Uhud just as prayer is offered over the dead. He then came back and sat on pulpit and said: I shall be present there (at the Cistern) before you. I shall be your witness and, by Allah, I perceive as if I am seeing with my own eyes my Cistern at this very state and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys of the earth and, by Allah, I am not afraid concerning you that you would associate anything (with Allah after me), but I am afraid that you would be vying with one another (for the possession of) the treasures of the earth.</p>

I am not afraid that you would associate anything with Allah after me, but I am afraid that you may be (allured) by the world and (vie) with one another (in possessing material wealth) and begin killing one another, and you would be destroyed as were destroyed those who had gone before you. &#8216;Uqba said that that was the last occasion that he saw Allah&#8217;s Massenger on the pulpit.</p>

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 030, Number 5865:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

So when one of. you sees a bad dream (hulm) which he does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil; then it will not harm him.</p>

And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of one&#8217;s own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one&#8217;s steadfastness in religion.

Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may my father be sacrificed for you, by Allah, allow me to interpret it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sail: Well, give its interpretation. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: The canopy signifies the canopy of Islam and that what it trickles out of it in the form of butter and honey is the Holy Qur&#8217;an and its sweetness and softness and what the people get hold of it in their palms implies major portion of the Qur&#8217;an or the small portion; and so far as the rope joining the sky with the earth is concerned, it is the Truth by which you stood (in the worldly life) and by which Allah would raise you (to Heaven). Then the person after you would take hold of it and he would also climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and it would be broken; then it would be rejoined for him and he would climb up with the help of it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may my father be taken as a ransom for you, tell me whether I have interpreted it currectly or I have made an error. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You have interpreted a part of it correctly and you have erred in interpreting a part of it. Thereupon he said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, tell me that part where I have committed an error. Thereupon he said: Don&#8217;t take oath.</p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: While I was asleep I saw myself on a well with a leathern bucket on a pulley. I drew (water) out of that as Allah wished me (to draw). Then the son of Abu Quhafa (Abu Bakr) drew from it one bucketful or two and there was some weakness in drawing that (may Allah forgive him). Then that bucket (changed into a large bucket) and Ibn Khattab drew it. I did not see any strongest man drawing it like &#8216;Umar b. Khattab. He brought out so much water that the camels of the people had enough to drink and then laid down (for rest).</p>

He (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi&#8217;r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had relieved himself and then performed ablution.

There came Abu Bakr and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>

Sa&#8217;d said: I had an earnest desire to hear it directly from Sa&#8217;d, so I met him and narrated to him what (his son) Amir had narrated to me, whereupon he said: Yes, I did hear it. I said: Did you hear it yourself? Thereupon he placed his fingers upon his ears and said: Yes, and if not, let both my ears become deaf.</p>

Abi Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that Muawiya b. Abi Sufyin appointed Sa&#8217;d as the Governor and said: What prevents you from abusing Abu Turab (Hadrat &#8216;Ali), whereupon be said: It is because of three things which I remember Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said about him that I would not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camelg. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say about &#8216;Ali as he left behind hrin in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). &#8216;All said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Aren&#8217;t you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call &#8216;Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:&#8221; Let us summon our children and your children.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali, Fitima, Hasan and Husain and said: O Allah, they are my family.</p>

Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah&#8217;s call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they?

I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set ont on a journey, he used to cast lots amongst his wives. Once this lot came out in my favour and that of Hafsa. They (Hafsi, and &#8216;A&#8217;isha) both went along with him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to travel (on camel) when it was night along with &#8216;A&#8217;isha and talked with her. Hafsa said to &#8216;A&#8217;isha: Would you like to ride upon my camel tonight and allow me to ride upon your camel and you would see (what you do not generally see) and I would see (what I do not see) generally? She said: Yes. So &#8216;A&#8217;isha rode upon the camel of Hafsa and Hafsa rode upon the camel of &#8216;A&#8217;isha and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came near the camel of &#8216;A&#8217;isha. (whereas) Hafsa had been riding over that. He greeted her and then rode with her until they came down. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) thus missed (the company of the Holy Prophet) and when they sat down, &#8216;A&#8217;isha felt jealous. She put her foot in the grass and said: O Allah, let the scorpion sting me or the serpent bite me. And so far as thy Messenger is concerned, I cannot say anything about him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person.

When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur&#8217;an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me.

As we came to her, she wept. They (Abu Bakr and Umar) said to her: What makes you weep? What is in store (in the next world) for Allah&#8217;s-Messenger (may peace be upon him) is better than (this worldly life). She said: I weep not because I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (in the next world) is better than (this world), but I weep because the revelation which came from the Heaven has ceased to come. This moved both of them to tears and they began to weep along with her.</p>

She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of her family: Do not narrate to Abu Talha about his son until I narrate it to him. Abu Talha came (home) ; she presented to him the supper. He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son. He was annoyed, and said: You did not inform me until I had a sexual intercourse with you and you later on gave me information about my son. He went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him what had happened. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah bless both of you in the night spent by you! He (the narrator) said: She became pregnant. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back to Medina from the journey he did not enter (his house) (during the night). When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning. And when it was morning I carried him (the child) and went along with him to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace beupon him). He said: I saw that he had in his hand the instrument for the cauterisation of the camels. When he saw me. he said: This is, perhaps, what Umm Sulaim has given birth to. I said: Yes. He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka&#8217;ba) and began to find out Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. &#8216;All saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you.

The people attacked him and made him fall down when &#8216;Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don&#8217;t you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him.

I made the mention of it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he struck his hand on my chest and said: O Allah, grant him steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the rightly-guided one. So he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir sent some person to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news about that. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have not come to you (but with the news) that we have left Dhu&#8217;l-Khalasah as a scabed camel. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) blessed the horses of Ahmas and the men of their tribe five times.</p>

Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur&#8217;an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was &#8216;Abdullah b. Salim.</p>

I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He (&#8216;Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it.

(So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

There is no calumny against her and she rises up early in the morning without eating the meat of the un- mindful. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: But you are not so.

Thereupon she said: What tornient can be more severe than this that he has become blind? He used to write satire as a rebuttal on behalf of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>

I invited her one day and she said to me something about Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which I hated. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) weeping and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she did not accept (my invitation).

My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard the noiee of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mubammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i. e.

I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it.

So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said.

I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa reported: We were in Yemen when we heard of the migration of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We also set out as immigrants to him. And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

We then said: If we sit (along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger) and observe night prayer with him it would be very good, so we sat down and he came to us and said: You are still sitting here. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we observed evening prayer with you, then we said: Let us sit down and observe night prayer along with you, whereupon he said: You have done well or you have done right. He then lifted his head towards the sky and it often happened that as he lifted his head towards the sky, he said: The stars are a source of security for the sky and when the stars disappear there comes to the sky, i. e. (it meets the same fate) as it has been promised (it would plunge into darkness). And I am a source of safety and security to my Companions and when I would go away there would fall to the lot (of my Companions) as they have been promised with and my Companions are a source of security for the Umma and as they would go there would fall to the lot of my Umma as (its people) have been promised.</p>

If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for something) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?</p>

So when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility because of blood-tie or relationship of marriage (with them). And when you see two persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick, than get out of that. He (Abu Dharr) said: I saw Abd al-Rahman b. Shurahbil b.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Naufal reported: I saw (the dead body) of Abdullah b. Zubair hanging on the road of Medina (leading to Mecca). The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of Hadrat &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Allah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar went away. The stand &#8216;Abdullah (b. &#8216;Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma&#8217; (bint Abu Bakr, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s mother). But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. &#8216;Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.</p>

<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Destiny (Kitab-ul-Qadr) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We give below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah&#8217;s Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore, stirs without His Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power (xlii. 48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy Qur&#8217;an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has done an atorn&#8217;s weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an atom&#8217;s weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur&#8217;an does not always signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Greatest Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:&#8221; Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God&#8217;s knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God&#8217;s creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one&#8217;s inherent possibilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.</p>

The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother&#8217;s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: There was argument between Adam and Moses. Moses said to Adam: You are our father. You did us harm and caused us to get out of Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Moses. Allah selected you (for direct conversation with you) and wrote with His own Hand the Book (Torah) for you. Despite this you blame me for an act which Allah had ordained for me forty years before He created me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said:. This is how Adam came the better of Moses and Adam came the better of Moses.</p>

Then you caused the people to get down to the earth because of your lapse. Adam said: Are you that Moses whom Allah selected for His Messengership and for His conversation with him and conferred upon you the tablets, in which everything was clearly explained and granted you the audience in order to have confidential talk with you. What is your opinion, how long Torah would haye been written before I was created? Moses said: Forty years before.

Monkeys and swine had been in existence even before (the metamorphosis of the human beings).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;dd reported that Umm Habiba said: 0 Allah, enable me to derive benefit from my husband, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and from my father Abu Sufyan, and from my brother Mu&#8217;awiya. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her: Verily, you have asked Allah about the durations of life already set, and the steps which you would take, and the sustenances the share of which is fixed. Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented and suffered metamorphosis). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyin through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

O My    servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race    of yours and that of jinns also all stand in one plain ground and you ask Me and I confer    upon every person what he asks for, it would not. in any way, cause any loss to Me (even    less) than that which is caused to the ocean by dipping the needle in it. My servants,    these for you I shall reward you for thern, so he who deeds of yours which I am recording    finds good should praise Allah and he who does not find that should not blame anyone but    his ownself. Sa&#8217;id said that when Abu Idris Khaulini narrated this hadith he knelt upon    his knees.</font></p>

The way of the mountain was narrow and she said (to that    dromedary): Go ahead (but that dromedary did not move). She (that slave-girl), out of    anger, said: O Allah, let that (dromedary) be damned. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace    be upon him) said: Let the dromedary on which the curse has been invoked not proceed with    us.</font></p>

They (his    Companions) said: One who has no children (the children are born unto him but they do not    survive). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: He is not a Raqub but Raqub is one who    does not find his child as the forerunner (in Paradise). He then said: Whom do you count    as a wrestler amongst you? We said: He who wrestles with persons. He said: No, it is not    he but one who controls himself when in a fit of rage.</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: What preparation have you made for that?

He (the Holy Prophet) said: What    preparation have you made for that? And he gave no details, but said: I love Allah and His    Messenger.

Malik reported through another chain of transmitters that a desert Arab came    to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon, him), the rest of the hadith is the same but with    this variation that he said: I have not made much preparations which merit appreciation    for myself.</font></p>

Thereupon    he (the Holy Prophet) said: You would be along with one whom you love. Anas said: Nothing    pleased us more after accepting Islam than the words of Allah&#8217;s Apostle: You would be    along with one whom you love. And Anas said. I love Allah and His Messenger and Abu Bakr    and Umar, and I hope that I would be along with them although I have not acted like them.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:&#8221; When the hypocrites come&#8221; (lxiii. 1). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.</p>

Ubayy) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that &#8216;Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:&#8221; You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times&#8221; (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you&#8221; (xli. 22).</p>

We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) in this world.

And as for those who have a yearning for error    they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain    them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge    say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of    understanding who really heed&#8221; (iii. 6). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported that Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see    such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned    verses).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Urwa b. Zubair reported that &#8216;A&#8217;isha said to him: This    news has reached me that &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr al-&#8216;As would pass by us during the Hajj season,    so you meet him and ask him (about religious matters) as he has acquired great knowledge    from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I thus met him and asked him about things    which he narrated from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And amongst these the    one he mentioned was that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah does    not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes away the scholars and    consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves amongst persons the    ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without (adequate) knowledge and    themselves go astray and lead others astray. &#8216;Urwa said: When I narrated this to &#8216;A&#8217;isha,    she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed reluctance to accept that (as    perfectly true) and said to, &#8216;Urwa: Did he (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr) say to you that he had    heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: (&#8216;Urwa had forgotten to ask this    from &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr). So when it was the next year, she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said to him (&#8216;Urwa):    Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him. talk to him and ask him about this hadith that    he narrated to You (last year on the occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge. He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time. So when I informed her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) about    that, she said: I do not think but this that he has certainly told the truth and I find    that be has neither made any addition to it, nor missed anything from it.</font></p>

He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 10: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Transactions (Kitab  Al-Buyu`) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Honesty in commercial dealings is more strictly enjoined by  Islam than by any other religion. It is because Islam is a religion which regulates and  directs life in all its departments. It is not to be regarded, like the modern man&#8217;s  religion. as a personal, private affair, which has nothing to do with his economic and  political life. It is not merely a body of dogmas or a bundle of rites and rituals; it is  a practical code which governs life in all its spheres. Its laws are as effectively  operative in our commerce and politics as in our domestic life and social relations. Islam  censures political chicanery and economic exploitation as strongly as social excesses and  individual dishonesty. Indeed, a true Islamic society is based upon honesty, justice and  fraternity, and is absolutely intolerant of dishonesty in all its various forms. That is  the reason why perfect honesty in business and truthfulness in trade are much emphasised  by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). It will not be an exaggeration to say that  absolute honesty in business and commerce is really an Islamic concept. The Hindus and  Jews were (and still, are) worshippers of the Mammon. Both of them have been mercenary  nations, notorious for their greed. The pre-Islamic Christians. too, did not possess any  high standard of business morality. It was Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) who,  on the one hand, urged his followers to adopt trade as their profession, and, on the other  band, exhorted them to observe truthfulness and honesty in their business transactions. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam lays the greatest emphasis on Qat Haldl (food earned  through lawful means). The pious among us believe that just as nasty food spolis our  physical health, similarly. food earned through unlawful means spoils our spiritual and  moral health. A man who liver on income derived through illicit means and fraudulent  practices cannot be morally advanced and spiritually elevated. If we try to comprehend the  exact, implications of the term Haram (unlawful) we can form an idea of the high standard  of morality on which Islam wants us to conduct our business. And, if business is conducted  strictly in accordance with the Islamic principles of commerce, there can be absolutely no  scope for any kind of commercial dishonesty varying from the simplest and most glaring  type of business fraud to the most cunning and subtle type of profiteering which is often  masked under a semblance of honesty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is most vehement in its condemnation of commercial  dishonesty. It denounced, in the strongest possible terms, all sorts of deceitful dealings  and illegal profits. It has disallowed all transactions not based upon justice and  fairplay The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), while reprimanding the dishonest  dealer, said:&#8221; Laisa minna man gashshdna&#8221; (Whosoever deceives us is not one of  us). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Ghazali, a Muslim who makes up his mind  to adopt trade as a profession or to set up his own business should first acquire a  thorough understanding of the rules of business transactions codified in the Islamic  Shari&#8217;ah. Without such understanding he will go astray and fail into serious lapses making  his earning unlawful. No people in the world have ever attached so much importance to  lawful trading as did the early Muslims, nor has any other nation evinced such a dread of  unlawful trading as they did. That is why al-Ghazali said stress on a clear understanding  of the rules and laws governing business transactions as a necessary prerequisite to  adopting trade or business as a profession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has stressed the importance of fairness in  business:&#8221; And, O my people, give full measure and weight justly, and defraud not men  of their things, and act not corruptly in the land making mischief. What remains with  Allah is better for you, if you are believers&#8221; (xi. 85-86). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In these words addressed by Hadrat Shu&#8217;aib to his people,  the Holy Qur&#8217;an enunciates the fundamental principles of commerce as follows </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give just measure and weight. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to withhold from the people the things that are their  due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to commit evil on the earth with the intent of doing  mischief. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To be contented with the profit that is left with us by God  after we have paid other people their due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We are told in these verses that commerce can flourish  under conditions of peace and security. The people are, therefore, warned not to disturb  the peace of the land so that there is a free and untrammelled trade between different  parts of the world. In commercial relations we are expected to be absolutely just and  honest, liberally giving other people their due. We are not to be guilty of selfish greed  and not to indulge in profiteering; and we are told that the lawful profit which has God&#8217;s  blessings is the one that we are able to make through perfectly honest dealings with  others. The injunctions contained in these Qur&#8217;anic verses and found elsewhere in the Holy  Book close the door of all dishonest and unjust transactions. We should not forget that  justice is a master virtue. If we give others just measure and just weight that  tantamounts to saying that we should be fair and just in our dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A careful study of&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu`&#8221; (the book  pertaining to business transactions) will reveal the fact that the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) based business dealings strictly on truth and justice. He has strongly  disapproved all transactions which involve any kind of injustice or hardship to the buyer  or the seller. He wanted that both, the buyer and the seller, should be truly sympathetic  and considerate towards each other. One should not take undue advantage of the simplicity  or ignorance of the other. The seller should not think that he has unrestricted liberty to  extort as much as possible from the buyer. He has to be just; he should take his own due  and give the buyer what is his. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam, which condemns every kind of injustice and  exploitation in human relations, wants its followers to conduct business in a sublime  spirit of justice tempered with human kindness. The conduct of the seller in a transaction  should be characterised not only by Insaf (justice), but also by Ihsan  (magnanimity).&#8221; God will forgive the sins of a Muslim who absolves a fellow-Muslim  from a sale-contract not liked by the latter,&#8221; says the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All transactions should be based on the fundamental  principle of&#8221; Ta&#8217;auanu ala birri wa&#8217;t-taqwa&#8221; (mutual co-operation for the cause  of goodness or piety). A transaction not based upon this sound principle is not lawful.  Unlawful transactions are motivated by lust for money and an ignoble desire to build up  prestige. Islam strikes at the root of the passion for money and suggests a different  yardstick to measure the prestige of a person. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, on the one hand, condemns  hoarding and the excessive love for wealth, and, on the other, declares virtue and piety  to be the criterion for determining a person&#8217;s worth.&#8221; Inna akramakum `ind-Allahi  atqakum&#8221; (The noblest in the eyes of God is the most pious among you). Thus does  Islam minimise in every possible way the temptation to illegal trade and traffic. Let us  now take note of the forms of business transactions which have been prohibited in Islam.  The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has not only disapproved of certain forms of  business transactions, but has also laid down some basic conditions that should be  fulfilled in every transaction if it is to be lawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following are some of these basic conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Things sold and money offered as their price to be lawfully  acquired. The things sold and the money to be offered as their price should both be  lawfully acquired and clearly specified. This condition demands that the goods sold should  have been lawfully obtained. One has no business to sell goods which one has stolen or  which one has acquired in a fraudulent manner. nor should one purchase anything with the  money which one has accepted as illegal gratification or has aceuired in some other  deceitful way. This condition holds the buyer and the seller responsible for lawful  possession of the goods on the partof one and of the money on the part of other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods not to be sold before obtaining their possession. The  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has warned the Muslims against indulging in forward  transactions which means selling goods before obtaining their possession.&#8221; Whoever  buys cereals shall not tell them until he has obtained their possession,&#8221; says the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). According to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, what applies to cereals  also applies to other categories of goods. On another occasion the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) has said:&#8221; Bargain not about that which is not with you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods to be bought in the open market. Goods and  commodities for sale should go into the open market, and the seller or his agents must be  aware of the state of the market before proposals are made for the purchase by the buyers.  The seller should not be taken unawares lest the buyers should take undue advantage of his  ignorance of the conditions and prices prevailing in the market. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No trade and traffic in things, the use of which is  prohibited by Islam. A Muslim can trade in those goods and commodities only the use of  which has been declared to be Halal (lawful). There can be no trade and traffic in things  the use of which is proliibited by Islam. For example, there can be no trade in wine,  swine, dead bodies of animals and idols. A devout Muslim merchant would not even traffic  in thin and transparent stuff for ladies because the use of such stuff by ladies is  unlawful. One cannot sell the carcass of an animal. He can, however, flay its skin which  can be used for making shoes and which can therefore, be sold, but not the flesh of the  dead animal. What is true of the usable skin of animals is also true of the tusks of an  elephant. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Prohibited forms of Business </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Monopoly business. As monopoly means concentration of  supply in one hand, it leads to exploitation of the consumers and the workers, it has,  therefore, been declared unlawful by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). Gigantic  trusts. cartels and monopolies should not exist in the Islamic society. The  monopoly-dominated economic order betrays lack of harmony between private and social good  and is, thus, a negation of the principle of maximum social advantage which the Islamic  society sets out to achieve. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Speculative business basd on selfish interest. Speculation  means buying something cheap in bulk at a time and selling it dear at another and, thus,  controlling the whole market to achieve personal gains. A close observation will reveal  that speculators are primarily interested in private gains regardless of the larger  interest of the society. These speculators try to create artificial scarcity of goods and  commodities and thereby create an inflationary pressure on the economy. As the poor masses  have to pay for this. Islam has condemned such speculative business. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Interest transactions. All transactions involving interest  are forbidden in Islam. Some people find it hard to submit to the injunction prohibiting  interest, because they think interest and profit earned in trade are similar. Capital  invested in trade brings an excess called profit; invested in banking it brings interest.  Why should one excess be considered lawful and the other unlawful? They fail to take note  of the basic difference between the two. Trade involves risk of loss. Also in its case, it  is not only the capital invested that brings profit which is equally the result of  initiative, enterprise and efficiency of the entrepreneur. Hence its rate cannot be  predetermined and fixed. Moreover, trade is productive. A person reaps a benefit after  undergoing labour and hardship. It creates conditions of full employment and economic  growth. It will also be noted that trade acts as one of the dominant factors in the  process of building up civilisation through co-operation and mutual exchange of ideas. The  spread of Islam and Islamic civilisation In the Far East has been mostly due to the  efforts of Muslim traders. Interest has no redeeming feature at all. The fixed rate of  profit which a person gets from a financial investment without any risk of loss and  without augmenting it with human labour creates in man the undesirable weakness of  miserliness and Shylockian selfishness and lack of sympathy. In the economic sphere it  initiates and aggravates crisis. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rightly, therefore, has Islam strictly prohibited all  transactions based on it or involving it in some form or other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Advancing money on interest, keeping deposits in a bank for  the sake of earning interest, or getting concessions in rates of goods or commodities  against advance payments of price, mortgaging and utilising an income-yielding property  against a certain sum, to be returned in full when the property is redeemed and investing  money in a trade against a predetermined and fixed rate of profit-are all unlawfnl  business transactions because they involve Riba (interest) in some form or the other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Transactions similar (in nature) to gambling. The Arabic  equivalent to gambling is Maisir which literarily means&#8221; getting something too  easily&#8221;,&#8221; getting a profit without working for it&#8221;. The literal meaning of  the term explains the principle on account of which gambling is prohibited in Islam. Any  monetary gain which cornes too easily, so much so that one does not have to work for it,  is unlawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The most familiar form of gambling amang the Arabs in the  days of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) was gambling by casting of lots by means  of arrows drawn from a bag. Some were blank and those who drew them got nothing. Others  indicated prizes-big or small ones. Whether one got anything or nothing depended on pure  luck. unless there was fraud on the part of someone concerned. The principle on which  objection to gambling is based is that you gain what you have not earned, or lose on a  mere chance. Dice, lottery, prize bonds and betting on horse races are to be held within  the definition of gambling. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Munabadha and Mulamasa. Islam recognises barter trade  subject to the injunctions of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In fact, Islam has closed all  doors of dishonesty and deceit in business dealings. It has prohibited all forms of  transactions which admit of fraud in the least degree. It has impressed on the traders  that defective and worthless goods should not be given in exchange for good ones, and if  there is a defect in the goods sold it must be pointed out and made manifest to the  purchaser. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; The buyer and the  seller have the option of cancelling the contract as long as they have not separated;  then. if they both speak the truth and make manifest, their transaction shall be blessed,  and it they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their transaction shall be  obliterated&#8221;. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Besides issuing the instructions which govern all forms of  trade, particularly barter trade, Islam has banned two forms of sale contract that were  prevalent before Islam. These were Munabadha and Mulamasa. In neither of these was the  purchaser offered an opportunity to examine the thing purchased. Munabadha means that the  seller should throw the cloth to the buyer before he has carefully examined it. The very  act of throwing the cloth will mean that the bargain has been struck. Mulamasa means  touching the cloth without examining it, ie. the buyer was just supposed to touch the  cloth to strike the bargain. Both these forms of transaction were prohibited because in  either case the purchaser got no opportunity to examine the things sold to him, and the  bargain was likely to prove unduly disadvantageous to one side. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In fact, Islam demanlds that goods and commodities for we  should go to the open market and the seller or his agents must be aware of the state of  the market before proposals are made for the purchase of goods or communities in bulk. He  should not be taken unawares lest advantage be taken of his ignorance of the state of the  market, and the prevailing prices. All this is ver clearly laid down by the Prophet (may  peace he upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As mentioned above, Islam tries to be fair to both parties  to a transaction. Any step on the part of one, that is advantageous to him and  disadvantageous to the other, is not permissible. The seller is expected to make the  defects (if any) in the goods manifest to the buyer, nor is the buyer expected to take  undue advantage of the ignorance of the seller. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mozabana. It is the exchange of fresh fruits for dry ones  in a way that the quantity of the dry fruit is actually measured and fixed, but the  quantity of the fresh fruit to be given in exchange is guessed while it is still on the  trees (Mishkat, 2710). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has forbidden this  exchange because the quantity of the fruit on the trees cannot be definitely Determined  and the transaction is just a leap into the dark. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;awama. It consists in selling the fruit on the trees for  a period of one, two or three years even before it has made its appearance. It is  prohibited because like Muzabana it is also a leap into the dark. Such transactions may  result in bitterness and frustration. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Gharar. It is to sell a thing which one doesn&#8217;t  have in one&#8217;s possession, nor expects to bring it under one&#8217;s control, e g. fish in the  river, or birds in the air. Possession is one of the basic conditions of a sale. One  cannot sell a thing which is not in one&#8217;s possession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-&#8216;Uryan. It is getting a thing against a nominal  advance on the condition that if the bargain is struck, the advance will be adjusted and  if the bargain is cancelled, the seller will riot return the advance. The advance being  nominal, the buyer has practically no liability. He will abide by the contract if he finds  it advantageous to him and will withdraw himself from it otherwise. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Mudtar. It is to buy a thing forcibly or to  purchase a thing when its owner is compelled under stress of want to dispose it of.  Instead of purchasing the thing, and taking undue advantage of the seller&#8217;s helplessness,  one should help him. Bai&#8217; alal-Bai&#8217; (sale over and above the sale of another). When one  person has sold goods to another, a third Person should not upset the bargain trying to  sell his own goods to the latter, offering them at lower rates or pointing out the defect  in the goods already sold to him by the former.&#8221; A Muslim should not purchase in  opposition to his brother, nor should he send a marriage proposal over and above the  proposal of another.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Hast (i. e. sale by means of pebbles). The  purchaser will tell the seller that when he will throw a pebble on his goods, the sale  contract will be confirmed or the seller tell the purchaser that on whatever thing a  pebble thrown by him falls will be sold to him. Sale contract is a serious matter and it  should not be accomplished by such hit-and-miss methods like throwing the pebbles on the  goods. A sale completed in this way may lead to injustice and hardship to one side and is  consequently prohibited. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sale of unripe fruit and unripe corn. The Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him), according to Hadrat Anas (Allah be pleased with him), has prohibited  the sale of grapes before they become dark and that of the corn before it ripens.  Similarly, he has forbidden the sale of raw dates. The fruit of the date palms should not  be sold until it becomes red or yellow. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Here is a brief account of the sale transactions prohibited  by Islam. If one ponders over these forms of transaction described above and described in  greater detail in&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu,&#8221; one can arrive at the following conclusions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam insists upon absolute justice and fairplay in  business dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, a person who sacrifices his faith, and  loses the good pleasure of his Lord to make a monetary gain has not made a good bargain. A  Muslim will not go in for such a bad bargain. A Muslim merchant is not a worshipper of the  Mammon with an inordinate love for money. He prizes faith, piety and righteousness above  all. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam does not believe in the view that all is fair in  business and that every kind of cleverness and deceit is justifiable in business  transactions. Islam regards business or commerce as an economic activity to be carried on  in a spirit of humanity. tarianism and justice. It does not approve of the cut-throat  competition. Indeed, the very concept is un-Islamic. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam expects the buyer and the seller to look upon each  other as Muslim brethren or fellow human beings, each trying to go all his way to help and  serve the other. It the seller happens to overcharge the buyer, he, instead of feeling  proud of his cleverness in doing so, should somehow compensate him for the excessive  payment received. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All bargains that are clenched without giving the purchaser  a fair chance of examining the things are prohibited because this amounts to denying him a  right that was his due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Forcible transactions or transactions in which the buyer  takes undue. advantage of the helplessness or misery of the seller are also discouraged. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has prohibited traffic in wine, swine, dead bodies of  animals and other goods the use of which has been declared to be Haram (unlawful). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has also forbidden trading in things that have a  debasing or vitiating influence on the Muslim society. </font></p>

The jews asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to let them continue    there on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit    (of the trees), whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: We would let you    continue there so long as we will desire. So they continued (to cultivate the lands) till    &#8216;Umar externed them to Taima&#8217; ang Ariha (two villages in Arabia, but out of Hijaz).</font></p>

I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn    &#8216;Umar). He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him).

Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with    two sa&#8217;s of (inferior dates) and bought one sa&#8217; of (these fine dates), for that is the    prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market and that is the price (of the fine    quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i. e. exchange    superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for    another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you    like. Abu Sa&#8217;ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there    is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is    exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and he    forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn &#8216;Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I    went on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He overtook me and I    was on a water-carrying camel who had grown tired and did not walk (trot). He (the Holy    Prophet) said to me: What is the matter with your camel? I said: It is sick. He (the Holy    Prophet) stepped behind and drove it and prayed for it, and then it always moved ahead of    other camels. He (then) said: How do you find your camel? I said: It is, by the grace of    your prayer, all right. He said: Would you sell this (camel) to me? I felt shy (to say    him,&#8221; No&#8221; ) as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said:    Yes, and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until    I reached Madina. I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I am newly married, so I asked his    permission (to go ahead of the caravan). He permitted me, and I reached Medina well in    advance of other people, until I reached my destination. There my maternal uncle met me    and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. He    reproved me in this connection. He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead    of the caravan) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) inquired of me whether I had    married a virgin or a non-virgin. I said to him: I have married a non-virgin. He said: Why    did you not marry a virgin who would have played with you and you would have played with    her? I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have    small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who    is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly. So I    have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after them and teach them    manners, When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina, I went to him in    the morning with the camel. He paid me its price and returned that (the camel) to me.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir reported: We went from Mecca to Medina with Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) when my camel fell ill, and the rest of the hadith is    the same. (But it in also narrated in it: ) He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Sell your    camel to me. I said: No, but it is yours. He said: No. (it can&#8217;t be), but sell it to me. I    said: No, but, Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is yours. He said: No, it can&#8217;t be, but sell it to    me. I said: Then give me an &#8216;uqaya of gold for I owe that to a person and then it would be    yours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I take it (for an &#8216;uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina    on it. As I reached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Bilal: Give    him an &#8216;uqiya of gold and make some extra payment too. He (Jabir) said: He gave me an    &#8216;uqiya of gold and made an addition of a qirat. He (Jabir) said: The addition made by    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was with me (as a sacred trust for belssing) and    lay with me in a pocket until the people of Syria took it on the Day of Harra.</font></p>

He goaded it and it    began to jump. After that I tried to restrain its rein so that I could listen to his    (Prophet&#8217;s) words, but I could not do that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) met me    and said: Sell it to me, and I sold it for five &#8216;uqiyas. I said: On the condition that I    may use it as a ride (for going back) to Medina. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Well, you may    use it as a ride up till Medina. When I came to Medina I handed over that to him and he    made an addition of an uqiya (to that amount which had been agreed upon) and then    presented that (camel) to me.</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down    one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass)    in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217;. I saught to    give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the    price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib was busy in    drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said:    Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and    cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to    Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps    altogether. Ibn Shihab reported &#8216;Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it    shocked me, and I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b,    Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I    also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza    raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from    them.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Husain b. &#8216;Ali reported &#8216;Ali having said: There fell to my    lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth    reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage    with Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), I prevailed upon a    goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217; to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir    wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding    feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two    she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I    collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps    had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken    out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that?    They said: Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in    the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his    companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels.    Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped    their haunches and tore out their livers. &#8216;Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) recognised from my face what I had experienced,    whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you? I    said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this    day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and    ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing    this) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it on    him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of    the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they    granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to    reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza&#8217;s eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his    eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then    Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and    came out, and we also came out along with him.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas b. Malik reported: I was the cup-bearer of some people    in the house of Abu Talha on the day when liquor was forbidden. Their liquor had been    prepared from dry dates or fresh dates when the announcer made the announcement. He (Abu    Talha) said to me: Go out and find out (what the announcement is). I got out (and found)    an announcer making this announcement: Behold, liquor has been declared unlawful. He said:    The liquor (was spilt and) flawed in the lanes of Medina. Abu Talha said to me: Go out and    Spill it, and I spilt it. They said or some of them said: Such and such were killed, such    and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their stomachs. He (the narrator) said. I    do not know whether it is the narration transmitted by Anas, (or by someone else). Then    Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:&#8221; There shall be no sin (imputed) unto    those who have believed and done good works for what they may have eaten as long as they    fear (Allah) and believe and do good works&#8221; (v. 93).</font></p>

It was only this Fadikh    that I had been serving to Abu Talha and Abu Ayyub and some persons from amongst the    Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in our house. When a person    came and said: Has the news reached you? We said, No. He said: Verily liquor has been    declared forbidden. Thereupon, Abd Talha said: Anas, spill these large pitchers.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) went out (of his house) one day or one night, and there he found Abu Bakr and    &#8216;Umar also. He said: What has brought you out of your houses at this hour? They said:    Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is hunger. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, what    has brought you out has brought me out too; get up. They got up along with him. and (all    of them) came to the house of an Ansari, but he was not at home. When his wife saw him she    said: Most welcome, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be Upon him) said to her: Where is so    and so? She said: He has gone to get some fresh water for us. When the Ansari came and he    saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his two Companions, he said: Praise be    to Allah, no one has more honourable guests today than I (have). He then went out and    brought them a bunch of ripe dates, dry dates and fresh dates, and said: Eat some of them.    He then took hold of his long knife (for slaughtering a goat or a sheep). Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Beware of killing a milch animal. He    slaughtered a sheep for them and after they had eaten of it and of the bunch and drank,    and when they had taken their fill and had been fully satisfied with the drink, Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and Umar: By Him in Whose Hand is my    life, you will certainly be questioned about this bounty on the Day of judgment. Hunger    brought you out of your house, then you did not return until this bounty came to you.</font></p>

I came to my wife and said    to her: Is there anything with you? I have seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    feeling extremely hungry. She brought out a bag of provisions which contained a sa&#8217;, of    barley. We had also with us a lamb. I slaughtered it. She ground the flour. She finished    (this work) along with me. I cut it into pieces and put it in the earthen pot and then    returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) (for inviting him). She said: Do not    humiliate me in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and those who    are with him. When I came to him I whispered to him saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we have    slaughtered a lamb for you and she has ground a sa&#8217; of barley which we had with us. So you    come along with a group of people with you. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him) said loudly: O people of the ditch, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so (come    along). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do not remove your earthen pot    from the hearth and do not bake the bread from the kneaded flour until I come. So I came    and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he was ahead of the people; and I    came to my wife and she said (to me): You will be humbled. I said: I did what you had    asked me to do. She (his wife) said: I brought out the kneaded flour and Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) put some saliva of his in that and blessed It. He then put saliva    in the earthen pot and blessed it and then said. Call another baker who can bake with you.    and bring out the soup from it, but do not remove it from the hearth, and the guests were    one thousand. (Jabir said): I take an oath by Allah that all of them ate (the food to    their fill) until they left it and went away and our earthen pot was brimming over as    before, and so was the case with our flour, or as Dahhak (another narrator) said: It (the    flour) was in the same condition and loaves had been prepared from that.</font></p>

She said: Yes. She    brought out barley loaves, then took out a head-covering of hers, in a part of which she    wrapped those loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it.    She then sent me to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I set forth and found    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sitting in the mosque in the company of some    persons.

Thereupon    Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) said to&#8217;those who were with him to get up He    went forth and so I did before them, until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talba    said: Umm Sulaim, here comes Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with people    and we do not have enough (food) to feed them. She said: Allah and His Messenger know    best. Abu Talha went out (to receive him) Until he met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came forward along with him until    they both (Allah&#8217;s Messenger, along with Abu Talha) came in. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: Umm Sulaim. bring forth that which you have with you. She brought    the bread. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that the bread be broken    into small pieces, and when Umm Sulaim had squeezed a small waterskin and put seasoning on    it, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited something regarding it what Allah    wished him to say. He then said: Allow ten (guests to come in and have their meals). He    permitted them; they ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (the Holy    Prophet) again said: Permit ten (more) and he (the host gave permission to them. They ate    until they had enough. Then they went out. he again said: Permit ten (more) until all the    people had eaten to their fill, and they were seventy or eighty persons.</font></p>

We presented    ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), but    none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may    peace be upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us    drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (It    was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner    that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go    to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night    the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the    Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no    need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had    penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest    it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! what have you done?    You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find    it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this    world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon    my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered,    and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what    I had done. There came Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he greeted as he used    to greet (by saying as-Salamu &#8216;Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer    and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He    raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was    going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said:    Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me drink. I held tight the    sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the    goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them were    milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and    milked them in that until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night? I said:    Drink it. and he drank it; he then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, drink it, and he drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then    perceived that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had been satiated and I had got his    blessings. I burst into laughter (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs.    I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, this affair of mind is like this and this. and I have done so.    Thereupon. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: This is nothing but a mercy from    Allah. Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened    our two friends and they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has    sent you with Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other)    people happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr reported: We were one hundred    and thirty (persons) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may    peace be upon him) said: Does any one of You possess food? There was a person with (us)    who had a sa&#8217; of flour or something about that, and it was kneaded. Then a tall polytheist    with dishevelled hair came driving his flock of sheep. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may    peace be upon him) said: Would you like to sell it (any one of these goats) or offer it as    a gift or a present? He said: No, (I am not prepared to offer as a gift), but I would sell    it. He (the Holy Prophet) bought a sheep from him, and it was slaughtered and its meat was    prepared, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that its liver should be    roasted. He (the narrator) said: By Allah, none among one hundred and thirty persons was    left whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not given a part out of her liver;    if anyone was present he gave it to him. but if he was absent it was set aside for him.    And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the other with mutton) and    we all ate out of them to our hearts&#8217; content, but (still) some part was (left) in (those)    two bowls, and I placed it on the camel- (or words to the same effect).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr reported that the people of    Suffa were very poor. Once the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to his    Companions): He who amongst you has food for two persons should take three (guests with    him). and he who has with him food for four persons should take five or six (guests with    him for entertaining them). It was (in accordance with these instructions of the Holy    Prophet) that Abu Bakr brought three persons, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon    him) brought ten persons (as guests to their respective houses). Abu Bakr had brought    three persons (he himself, and myself), my father and my mother (along with therm). He    (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he also said: My wife and one servant who was    common between our house and that of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had had his evening meal with    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He stayed here until night prayer had been    offered. He then came back (to the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and stayed there until    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt drowsy and (Abu Bakr) then came (back to    his own house) when (a considerable) part of the night had been over, as Allah had    desired. His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! have you    not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them.    but they refused to eat until you came. He (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid    myself. He (Abu Bakr) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the    guests: Eat, though it may not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He    (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did not take a morsel when from beneath that (there    appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, and lo! it was more than what it was    before. Abu Bakr saw that and found that it was so or more than that. He said to his wife:    Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. it is in excess    by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr ate saying: That was from the Satan    (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it    (the rest) to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and it was kept there until    morning, and during (those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people,    and the period of covenant was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every    person amongst them. It is Allah only Who knows as to how many people were there with each    of them. He sent (this food to them) and all of them ate out of it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Abd Bakr reported: There came to our    house some guests. It was a common practice with my father to (go) and talk to Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) during the night. While going he said: &#8216;Abd al-Rahman,    entertain the guests. When it was evening we served the food to them, but they refused    saying: So long as the owner of the house does not come and join us, we would not take the    meal. I said to them: He (&#8216;Abd Bakr) is a stern person, and if you would not do that (if    you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my    father) came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the peopleof    the household) said: We have not served them sofar. He said: Did I not command &#8216;Abd    al-Rahman (to do this)? He (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and kept myself away by    that time. He again said: O stupid fellow, I ask you on oath that In case you hear my    voice you come to me. I came and said: By Allah, there is no fault of mine. These are your    guests; you may ask them. I provided them with food but they refused to eat until you    came. He said to them: Why is it that you did not accept our food? By Allah, I shall not    even take food tonight (as you have not taken). They said: By Allah, we would not take    until you join us. Thereupon he Abu Bakr) said: I have never seen a more unfortunate night    than this. Woe be to thee! that you do not accept from us food prepared for you. He again    said: What I did first (that is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by    the Satan. Bring the food. The food was brought, and he ate by reciting the name of Allah    and they also ate, and when it was morning he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, their oath (that of the guests) came to be true, but    mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole incident. He said: Your    oath came to be the most true and you are the best of them. He (the narrator) said. I do    not know whether he made an atonement for it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 11: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Rules of  Inheritance (Kitab Al-Farai`d) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Inheritance is the entry of living persons into possession  of dead persons&#8217; property and exists in some form wherever the institution of private  property is recognised as the basis of the social and economic system. The actual forms of  inheritance and the laws governing it, however, differ according to the ideals of  different societies. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The law of inheritance in Islam is based upon five main  considerations: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To break up the concentration of wealth in individuals and  spread it out in society. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To respect the property right of ownership of an individual  earned through honest means. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To hammer in the consciousness of man the fact that man is  not the absolute master of wealth he produces but he is its trustee and is not, therefore,  authorised to pass it on to others as he likes. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To consolidate the family system which is the social unit  of an Islamic society. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give incentive to work and encourage economic activity  as sanctioned by Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the pre-Islamic world and even in modern societies the  law of inheritance has so many evils in it, which may be summed up in the following  points: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Women had been completely denied the share of inheritance.  They were rather regarded as part of the property of the deceased and, therefore, their  right to property by inheritance was out of question. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In pre-Islamic Arabia and other countries where there had  been tribal societies not only women were deprived of the right of inheritance but even  weak and sick persons and minor children were given no share in it, as the common  principle of inheritance was that he alone is entitled to inherit who wields the sword. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then in certain societies there had been existing the law  of primogeniture and it exists even today in some of the so-called civilised parts of the  world which entitles only the eldest son to inherit the whole of the father&#8217;s property or  to get the lion&#8217;s share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam introduced so many reforms in the laws of inheritance  which can be succinctly summed up as follows. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It defined and determined in clear-cut terms the share of  each inheritor and imposed limits on the right of the property-owner to dispose of his  property according to his whim and caprice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It made the female, who had been prevously thought a  chattel, the co-sharer with the male and thus not only restored her dignity, but  safeguarded her social and economic rights. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It laid the rules for the break-up of the concentrated  wealth in the society and helped in its proper and equitable distribution amongst a large  number of persons. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It gave a death-blow to the law of primogeniture and thus  provided the democratic basis for the division of the property of the deceased. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The above are some of the distinguishing features of the  Islamic law of inheritance. While laying down the rules for the distribution of the estate  of the deceased, the first principle to be observed is that the property both movable and  immovable can be distributed after meeting the following obligations: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>funeral expenses; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>clearing off the debts incurred by the deceased; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>payment of bequest, if any, to the extent of one-third of  the total assets. It may be remembered that the Mahr of the wife, if it had not been paid,  is included in the debt. Moreover, it is not lawful to make a bequest in favour of a  person who is entitled to a share in the inheritance. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Four persons cannot get inheritance: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(a) a fugitive slave who has fled away from his master, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(b) one who has murdered one&#8217;s predecessor intentionally or  unintentionaly </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(c) one who professes a religion other than Islam, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(d) one living in Dar-ul-Harb cannot inherit the property  of one living in Dar-ul-Islam and vice versa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, the heirs have been divided into three  classes. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(A) Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id are those persons who have a right to  definite shares in assets left by the deceased. These sharers are twelve in number; four  males: father, grandfather, uterine brothers and husband; and eight females: wife, single  daughter, son&#8217;s daughter, mother, grandmother, full sister, consanguine sister, uterine  sister. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Father&#8217;s share is one-sixth when the deceased leaves a son  or a son&#8217;s son, but if the deceased is not survived by a son or grandson his father will,  in addition to this share (one-sixth), also get a share of being &#8216;Asaba. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The grandfather&#8217;s share is like that of father&#8217;s share but  in three conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Bukhiri and Imam Muslim, the presence of  father deprives even the brothers of their share in the inheritance. but this is not the  case with the grandfather. Imam Abu Hanifa is of the opinion that the presence of  grandfather deprives the brother of his share in the inheritance. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the father of the deceased is alive, then the share of  the mother is of what is left from the share of the wife of the deceased. The presence of  grandfather does not reduce the share of the mother of the deceased. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The grandmother of the deceased has no share in the  presence of the father of the deceased but she has a share in the presence of the  grandfather. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The third set of sharers are uterine brothers and sisters.  They are entitled to one-sixth if their number is one, and one-third if they are more than  one. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The husband&#8217;s share is one-half of the property of the  deceased wife if she has no children, but in case of children it is one-fourth. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wife is entitled to one-fourth if the husband dies  childless; otherwise it is one-eighth. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Real daughter: one-half when alone, and two-thirds if more  than one. If the deceased is survived by a male child also. the daughters are then treated  as Asaba and the male child would get double of what falls to the lot of daughters. The  granddaughters stand on the same level as daughters. But in case the deceased is survived  by one real daughter and one or more than one granddaughter they would get one-sixth. The  granddaughter is not entitled to any share if the deceased is survived by a son, but if he  is survived by grandsons and granddaughters, they would be treated as &#8216;Asaba and the male  grandchild would get double of what goes to the female grandchild. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Full sister gets one-half if she is alone, and two-thirds  if they are more than one. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Consanguine sister is entitled to one-half if one, and two  thirds if more. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mother is entitled to one-sixth when she has a child or  grandchild, and in case of being childless she gets one-third of the share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the deceased is survived either by paternal grandmother  or maternal grand- mother or even by both, they are entitled to one-sixth. The grandmother  (maternal) is deprived of her share if the mother of the deceased is alive; and if father  is alive the paternal grandmother is deprived of this share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(B) When the heirs of the first group have received the  respective shares, the residue of the assets falls to the share of those relatives who are  called Asaba which, according to the Shari&#8217;ah, implies those relatives in whose line of  relationship no female enters. This is the second group of inheritors. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There is no fixed share of the &#8216;Asabat. If the deceased is  not survived by any Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id, the whole of the property falls to their share; and  If Dhaw-u&#8217;I. Fara&#8217;id are there to get their due share, the residue will be taken by the  Asabat. The following are the &#8216;Asabat: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Son: He is the first to get the residue in order of  succession. The daughters are entitled to half of the share as given to the son. The  grandsons are not entitled to any share in the presence of the son. If the son is not  living, then the grandson is entitled to a share in the inheritance. If there are more  than one son, the inheritance will be distributed equally amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The father, grandfather and the great-grandfather are  included in the category of Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id. If, however, the deceased is not survived by  category of a son, grandson of great-grandson, then the father will fall under the  category of &#8216;Asaba, and, in the absence of the father, the grandfather assumes that  position. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the deceased is not survived by son, or grandson or  father or grandfather, i. e. none amongst the &#8216;Asabat, then the brother, and in the  absence of brother his son, and in the absence of son, his grandson will be entitled to  share in the inheritance as &#8216;Asaba and the female would also join them in share claiming  half of the share as compared with male. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If unfortunately the deceased is survived by none of the  above-mentioned relatives amongst the &#8216;Asabat, then consanguine brother will be entitled  to share in the inheritance and he will be preferred to full brother&#8217;s son. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then comes the turn of full paternal uncle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(C) The last category of inheritors are known ad Dhaw-u&#8217;l  Arham, i. e. relations connected through females, but it is in extremely rare cases that  they get any share in the inheritance. The following relatives come under this category. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The son of the daughter and daughter of the daughter. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The son of the daughter of the son, and daughter of the  daughter of the son and their children. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Maternal grandfather, maternal grandfather of the father,  the grandfather of the mother, maternal grandfather of the mother, the grandmother of the  mother, the children of the sisters, the sisters of the father and those of the mother,  etc. </font></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) performed ablution, and sprinkled over me the water of    his ablution. I regained my consciousness and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, my case of    inheritance is that of Kalala. Then the verse pertaining to the inheritance ( of Kalala)    was revealed. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Muhammad b. Munkadir: (Do you mean    this verse)&#8221; They ask you; say: Allah gives you decision in regard to Kalala&#8221;    (iv. 177)? He said: Yes, it was thus revealed.</font></p>

<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Gifts (Kitab Al-Hibat) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of  property, movable and immovable, from one person to the other willingly and without any  reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as donor (Wahib), and the thing  transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is known as Mauhub lahu  (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar&#8217;i&#8217;ah are Nihla or &#8216;Atiyya. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders  the possession of the thing donated. Moreover, the declaration of donation should be in  clear terms without any ambiguity (around them). This act of donation is based on the  following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him):&#8221; Give presents to one  another for this would increase your mutual love.&#8221; This not only implies the legality  of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement  amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by  any person capable of making a contract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid,  and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond one-third of the assets of the  deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be made to a living  person and not to one who is dead. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Shari&#8217;ah imposes certain restrictions on the property  which is to be donated. In the first place, the property must be in existence at the time  when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesame or of butter in the milk would  not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked except in some  extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by him  from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah. The  right to revoke a gift is called Raj&#8217;. This act of revocation can be done with the decree  of a competent court. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I    donated a pedigree horse in the path of Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought    that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah&#8217;s Menengsr (may peace be upon him)    about it, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who    gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated    on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this    addition:&#8221; Don&#8217;t buy that even if he gives you for one dirham.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of his father that    &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) donated a horse in the path of Allah. He found that it    had languished in the hand of its possessor, and he was a man of meagre resources He    (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) intended to buy it. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy that even if you get it    for a dirham for he who gets back the charity is like a dog which swallows its vomit.</font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 13:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Bequests (Kitab Al-Wasiyya) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bequest (WasIyya) or will is defined as a transfer to come into operation after the testator&#8217;s death. The testator is called Musi, and the legatee or devisee is called Musa lahu, and the executor is called Wasi. It is a spiritual testament of a man enabling him to make up his shortcomings in the worldly life and securing rewards in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Shar&#8217;iah, one is entitled to make a will for one-third of one&#8217;s property and not beyond that so that the rights of the legal heirs are not adversely affected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Again, the principle on which the legality of a testamentary disposition is based being in defeance pro tanto of the rights of heirs generally the law requires that such disposition should be for the benefit of non-heirs alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; A further reason why a bequest in favour of an heir is not allowed is that it would amount to giving preference to some heirs over others, thus defeating the spirit of the law which has fixed the portion of each in the inheritance and causing disputes among persons related to one another. If the other heirs consent to a bequest to one of them or to a bequest of more than one-third of the estate, the above reasons no longer hold good and the bequest as made will be valid&#8221; (Abdur Rahim, The Principles of Muhammadan jurisprudence, pp. 311-2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, preferable and most advisable not to will away the property if the legal heirs are poor, because it manifests benevolence to the heirs who have superior claim to it from the relations in which they stand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another principle which is observed in case of bequest is that the proprietary right of a legatee in a bequest is establislied if he accepts it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Amir b. Sa&#8217;d reported on the authority of his father (Sa&#8217;d b. Abi Waqqas): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me in my illness which brought me near death in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am afflicted and I am a man possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of my property) as Sadaqa? He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity) and that is quite enough. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging from people; that you would never incur an expense seeking therewith the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded therefor, even for a morsel of food that you put in the mouth of your wife. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. would I survive my companions? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a deed by means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status (in religion) and prestige; you may survive so that people would benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah, complete for my Companions their migration, and not cause them to turn back upon their heels. Sa&#8217;d b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt grief for him as he had died in Mecca.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, grant health to Sa&#8217;d. O Allah, grant health to Sad. He repeated it three times. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I own a large property and I have only one daughter as my inheritor. Should I not will away the whole of my property? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He said: (Should I not will away, ) two-thirds of the property? he (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He (Sa&#8217;d) (again) said: (Should I not will away) half (of my property)? He said: No. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: Then one-third? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yes), one-third, and one-third is quite substanial. And what you spend as charity from your property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your family is also Sadaqa, and what your wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and that you leave your heirs well off (or he said: prospreous) is better than to leave them (poor and) begging from people. He (the Holy Prophet) pointed this with his hands.</p>

He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have acquired land in Khaibar. I have never acquired property more valuable for me than this, so what do you command me to do with it? Thereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) said: If you like, you may keep the corpus intact and give its produce as Sadaqa. So &#8216;Umar gave it as Sadaqa declaring that property must not be sold or inherited or given away as gift. And Umar devoted it to the poor, to the nearest kin, and to the emancipation of slaves, aired in the way of Allah and guests. There is no sin for one, who administers it if he eats something from it in a reasonable manner, or if he feeds his friends and does not hoard up goods (for himself). He (the narrator) said: I narrated this hadith to Muhammad, but as I reached the (words)&#8221; without hoarding (for himself) out of it.&#8221; he (Muhammad&#8217; said:&#8221; without storing the property with a view to becoming rich.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Aun said: He who read this book (pertaining to Waqf) informed me that in it (the words are)&#8221; without storing the property with a view to becoming rich.&#8221;</p>

Try to learn from him (this point). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Leave me. I am better in the state (than the one in which you are engaged). I make a will about three things: Turn out the polytheists from the territory of Arabia; show hospitality to the (foreign) delegations as I used to show them hospitality.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran b. Husain reported that the tribe of Thaqif was the ally of Banu &#8216;Uqail. Thaqif took two persons from amongst the Companiobs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as prisoners. The Campanions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took one person at Banu Uqail as prisoner, and captured al-&#8216;Adbi (the she-camel of the Holy Prophet) along with him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was very compassionate, and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Adbi&#8217; was caught. The woman had been tied with ropes. The people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. She escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and fumed and so she left them until she came to al-, Adbi&#8217;. It did not fret and fume; it was docile She rode upon its back and drove it away and she went off. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) took vow for Allah, that in case He would save her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice. As she reached Medina, the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adbi, the she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Messanger (may peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it that she took vow to Allah that if He saves her on its back, she would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the version of Ibn Hujr (the words are):&#8221; There is no vow in disobedience to Allah.&#8221;</p>

They brought the matter to (Hadrat) Dawud (David) for decision and he made a    decision in favour of the elder one. They then went to Sulaiman b. Dawud (may there be    peace upon both of them) and told them (the story). He said: Bring me a knife so that I    may cut him (the child) (into two parts) for you. The younger one said: No, it can&#8217;t be,    may Allah have mercy upon you, he (the child) belongs to her (the elder). So he gave a    decision in favour of the younger one. abu Huraira said: If ever I heard of the word    as-sikin at all, it was that day. We called it by no other name but al-Mudya.</font></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) then ordered to give us three white humped camels, We started and said (or some of us said to the others): Allah will not bless us. We came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) begging him to provide us with riding camels. He swore that he could not provide us with a mount, but later on he provided us with that. They (some of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came and informed him about this (rankling of theirs), whereupon he said: It was not I who provided you with a mount, but Allah has provided you with that. So far as I am concerned, by Allah, if He so wills, I would not swear, but if, later on, I would see better than it, I (would break the vow) and expiate it and do that which is better.</p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: &#8216;Abdullah b. Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa&#8217;d), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which he did not say. They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayyub said: We were sitting in the company of Abu Musa that he called for food and it consisted of flesh of fowl. It was then that a person from Banu Tamim visited him. His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl&#8217;s meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash&#8217;ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allali&#8217;s Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.</p>

Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was at ji&#8217;rana (a town near Mecca) on his way back from Ta&#8217;if: Messenger of Allah, I had taken a vow during the days of Ignorance that I would observe I&#8217;tikaf for one day in the Sacred Mosque. So what is your opinion? He said: Go and observe I&#8217;tikaf for a day. And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave him a slave girl out of the one-fifth (of the spoils of war meant for the Holy Prophet). And when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (inay peace be upon him) set the war prisoners free. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab heard their voice as they were saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set as free. He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: What is this? They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set free the prisoners of war (which had fallen to the lot of people). Thereupon he (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: Abdullah, go to that slave-girl and set her free.</p>

I (the narrator) said: I    think he (&#8216;Umar) also said: You may wear it on Friday (also).

He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have    sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment    (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. why is it    that you look at me like this. whereas you yourself presented it to me? He said: I never    sent it to you to wear it, but I sent It to you so that you may tear it and make out head    covering for your ladies.</font></p>
