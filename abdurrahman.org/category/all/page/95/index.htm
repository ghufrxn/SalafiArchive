<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said,  &#8220;Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns  into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a  similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four  things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the  blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person  among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or  an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has  ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and  enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit  or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of  the people of the Fire and enters it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 594: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah puts an angel in charge of  the uterus and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O  Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation,  the angel asks, &#8216;O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a  blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?&#8217; So all  that is written while the creature is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the people of  Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he  will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do.&#8221; (i.e. everybody will find  easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been  created). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No child  is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It  is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one  before you mutilate them yourself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do  you think about those (of them) who die young?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah knows  what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No woman should ask for the  divorce of her sister (Muslim) so as to take her place, but she should marry the man  (without compelling him to divorce his other wife), for she will have nothing but what  Allah has written for her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa&#8217;d, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  and Mu&#8217;adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his  daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and  we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Allah  has ordained to come into existence but will be created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of  us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events  taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before  their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who  has been absent and then sees and recognizes him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 602: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 603: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 604: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet forbade vowing and said, &#8220;In fact, vowing  does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (that Allah said), &#8220;Vowing does not  bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is  imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his  wealth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet said, &#8220;No Caliph is appointed but has  two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and  the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the  one whom Allah protects.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding the Verse) &#8220;And We granted the vision  (Ascension to the heavens &#8220;Miraj&#8221;) which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual  eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.&#8217; (17.60): Allah&#8217;s Apostle actually saw with his  own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night  Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the  Qur&#8217;an is the tree of Az-Zaqqum. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Adam and Moses argued with each  other. Moses said to Adam. &#8216;O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us  out of Paradise.&#8217; Then Adam said to him, &#8216;O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Muawiya wrote to  Mughira. &#8216;Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.&#8217; So Al-Mughira  dictated to me and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying after the prayer, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold  what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is  useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Take refuge with Allah from the  difficulties of severe calamities, from having an evil end and a bad fate and from the  malicious joy of your enemies.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When taking an oath, the Prophet very often used to say,  &#8220;No, by Him Who turns the hearts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;I have kept for you a  secret.&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;Ad-Dukh.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Keep quiet,  for you cannot go beyond your limits (or you cannot exceed what has been foreordained for  you).&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop off his  neck!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave him, for if he is he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal), then you  will not be able to overcome him, and if he is not, then you gain no good by killing  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the plague. He said,  &#8220;That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whom-so-ever He wished,  but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town  in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but has  patience and hopes for Allah&#8217;s reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what  Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the Prophet on the Day of (the battle of) Al-Khandaq,  carrying earth with us and saying, &#8220;By Allah, without Allah we would not have been  guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would we have prayed. O Allah! Send down Sakina  (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet (the enemy). The pagans have  rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse  (to flee).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 5). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer is that  of a fresh tender plant, which the wind bends lt sometimes and some other time it makes it  straight. And the example of a hypocrite is that of a pine tree which keeps straight till  once it is uprooted suddenly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The example of a believer is  that of a fresh tender plant; from whatever direction the wind comes, it bends it, but  when the wind becomes quiet, it becomes straight again. Similarly, a believer is afflicted  with calamities (but he remains patient till Allah removes his difficulties.) And an  impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allah cuts  (breaks) it down when He wishes.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 558, Vol. 9.) </font></p>

Would that one day I would drink of  the water of Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear  to me.&#8217; Then I came and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, whereupon he said, &#8220;O  Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy  and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and put it in Al&#8217;Juhfa.&#8221; </font></p>

So she should hope for Allah&#8217;s reward and remain patient.&#8221; She  again sent a message, beseeching him by Allah, to come. So the Prophet got up. and so did  we (and went there). The child was placed on his lap while his breath was irregular. Tears  flowed from the eyes of the Prophet. Sad said to him, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;This Is Mercy which Allah has embedded in the hearts of  whomever He wished of His slaves. And Allah does not bestow His Mercy, except on the  merciful among His slaves. (See Hadith No. 373 Vol. 2) </font></p>

The Prophet proceeded till he passed by a gathering in  which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that had been before &#8216;Abdullah  embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the donkey  covered the gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and  said, &#8220;Do not trouble us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and  dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them  some verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &#8220;O man ! There is  nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our  gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.&#8221;  On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our  gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing  each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they  became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon  Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &#8220;O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&#8221; Sad said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for  Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town (Medina decided  unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his head, but  when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was  grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way  you have seen.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None of you should wish for death  because of a calamity befalling him; but if he has to wish for death, he should say:  &#8220;O Allah! Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is  better for me.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 576: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais bin Abi Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had  been branded (cauterized) at seven places in his body. He said, &#8220;Our companions who  died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (this world) without having their rewards  reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we have got (so much) wealth that  we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings Had the Prophet not  forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.&#8217; We visited him for the second  time while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for  whatever he spends except for something that he spends on building.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 577: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The good deeds of any  person will not make him enter Paradise.&#8221; (i.e., None can enter Paradise through his  good deeds.) They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8216;Not even you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He  said, &#8220;Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.&#8221; So be  moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and none  of you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds,  and if he is an evil doer, he may repent to Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet , who was resting against me, saying,  &#8220;O Allah! Excuse me and bestow Your Mercy on me and let me join with the highest  companions (in Paradise).&#8221; See Qur&#8217;an (4.69) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 579: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle paid a visit to a patient, or a  patient was brought to him, he used to invoke Allah, saying, &#8220;Take away the disease,  O the Lord of the people! Cure him as You are the One Who cures. There is no cure but  Yours, a cure that leaves no disease.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 580: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came to me while I was ill. He performed  ablution and threw the remaining water on me (or said, &#8220;Pour it on him) &#8221; When I  came to my senses I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have no son or father to be my heir,  so how will be my inheritance?&#8221; Then the Verse of inheritance was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 581: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them and said, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, &#8220;Everybody is  staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.&#8221; And  when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): &#8220;Would that I could  stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds  of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and  would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!&#8221; I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him about that. He said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina  as much or more than we love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd,  and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.&#8221; (See Hadith No 558) . </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.079.699"></a>Volume 8, Book 79, Number 699:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and he said to me, &#8220;Come near.&#8221; So I went near to him and he said, &#8220;Are your lice troubling you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting, Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Aiyub said, &#8220;Fasting should be for three days, and the Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to six poor persons.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 700:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual relation with my wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got enough to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he sat down. Afterwards an &#8216;Irq, i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Take this and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we?&#8221; On that, the Prophet smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, &#8220;Feed your family with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 701:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said to him?&#8221; &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then an Ansari man came with an Irq (a big basket full of dates). The Prophet said (to the man), &#8220;Take this (basket) and give it in charity.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth! There is no house in between the two mountains (of the city of Medina) poorer than we.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go and feed it to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 702:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophets and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; Later on an Irq (big basket) containing dates was given to the Prophet, and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take this basket and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we? Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 703:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ju&#8217;aid bin Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings on their measures, Sa&#8217; and Mudd (i.e., of the people of Medina) &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) for me?&#8221; Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, &#8220;That was a coptic slave who died in the same year.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 708:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that she intended to buy Barira (a slave girl) and her masters stipulated that they would have her Wala&#8217;. When &#8216;Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet ; he said, &#8220;Buy her, for the Wala&#8217; is for the one who manumits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 709:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 710:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 711:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!) Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud related to us two narrations: One from  the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were  sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person  considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like  this.&#8221; Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration.  (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the repentance  of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has  his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a  short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and  suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then  says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he  raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke  up, answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then slept. He got up  (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouth thereof and performed ablution not  using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got  up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching  him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on  his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered  thirteen Rak&#8217;at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath  as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the  approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer  without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij&#8217;al fi  qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam&#8217;i nuran, wa&#8217;an yamini nuran, wa&#8217;an yasari nuran,  wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj&#8217;al li nuran.&#8221;  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, &#8220;I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet  mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-&#8216;Abbas and he narrated  those seven things to me, mentioning, &#8216;(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my  blood, my hair and my body,&#8217; and he also mentioned two other things.&#8221; </font></p>

Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get  up, he said, &#8220;&#8216;Stay in your places,&#8221; and sat between us, till I felt the  coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you of a  thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say &#8216;Allahu  Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdu &#8216;illah&#8217;  thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221; Ibn Sirin said,  &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&#8221; </font></p>

Would that you  let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; When the people (Muslims) lined up, the battle  started, and &#8216;Amir was struck with his own sword (by chance) by himself and died. In the  evening, the people made a large number of fires (for cooking meals). Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;What is this fire? What are you making the fire for?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;For cooking the meat of donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the pots  and break the pots!&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!

(The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, &#8220;I  went out with a group of men from my nation.&#8221;) and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt  it, and then came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not come to you  till I left it like a camel with a skin disease.&#8221; The Prophet then invoked good upon  Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet divided something (among the Muslims) and  distributed the shares (of the booty). A man said, &#8220;This division has not been made  to please Allah.&#8221; When I informed the Prophet about it, he became so furious that I  noticed the signs of anger on his face and he then said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy  on Moses, for he was hurt with more than this, yet he remained patient.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Preach to the people once a week,  and if you won&#8217;t, then preach them twice, but if you want to preach more, then let it be  three times (a week only), and do not make the people fed-up with this Qur&#8217;an. If you come  to some people who are engaged in a talk, don&#8217;t start interrupting their talk by  preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if  they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say.  And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his  companions always avoided it.&#8221; </font></p>

When we reached a  place called As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite  the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of  his marriage to her.

I make the land between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains a  sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his father said, &#8220;In the year of Hajjatal-Wada&#8217;,  the Prophet paid me a visit while I was suffering from an ailment that had brought me to  the verge of death. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My sickness has reduced me to the (bad)  state as you see, and I am a rich man, but have no heirs except one daughter. Shall I give  2/3 of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then 1/2 of it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  1/3 is too much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in  poverty, begging from people. And (know that) whatever you spend in Allah&#8217;s Cause, you  will get reward for it, even for the morsel of food which you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left behind my companions (in Mecca)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If  you remain behind, whatever good deed you will do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will raise and upgrade  you to a higher position (in Allah&#8217;s Sight). May be you will live longer so that some  people may benefit by you, and some e others (pagans) may get harmed by you. O Allah!  Complete the migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels; But (we pity)  the poor Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sa&#8217;d) (died in Mecca)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle lamented (or pitied) for him as he died in Mecca.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he  used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his  Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has  advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my  head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with  this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who  has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which  are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the  dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and  returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion  of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured  me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn  and harm others with).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet) said, &#8220;On Friday there is a  particular time. If a Muslim happens to be praying and invoking Allah for something good  during that time, Allah will surely fulfill his request.&#8221; The Prophet pointed out  with his hand.

Be  gentle and beware of being harsh and of saying evil things.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t  you hear what they said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear what I replied (to them)?  have returned their statement to them, and my invocation against them will be accepted but  theirs against me will not be accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There are two expressions which are  very easy for the tongue to say, but they are very heavy in the balance and are very dear  to The Beneficent (Allah), and they are, &#8216;Subhan Allah Al-&#8216;Azim and &#8216;Subhan Allah wa  bihamdihi.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has some angels who look  for those who celebrate the Praises of Allah on the roads and paths. And when they find  some people celebrating the Praises of Allah, they call each other, saying, &#8220;Come to  the object of your pursuit.&#8217; &#8221; He added, &#8220;Then the angels encircle them with  their wings up to the sky of the world.&#8221; He added. &#8220;(after those people  celebrated the Praises of Allah, and the angels go back), their Lord, asks them (those  angels)&#8212;-though He knows better than them&#8212;-&#8216;What do My slaves say?&#8217; The angels reply,  &#8216;They say: Subhan Allah, Allahu Akbar, and Alham-du-lillah, Allah then says &#8216;Did they see  Me?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;No! By Allah, they didn&#8217;t see You.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah says, How it would have been if they saw Me?&#8217; The  angels reply, &#8216;If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate Your  Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to anything more often.&#8217;  Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;What do they ask Me for?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They ask You for  Paradise.&#8217; Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;Did they see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No! By Allah, O  Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels  say, &#8216;If they saw it, they would have greater covetousness for it and would seek It with  greater zeal and would have greater desire for it.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;From what do they seek  refuge?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;Did they  see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No By Allah, O Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it  would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;If they saw it they would flee from it  with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.&#8217; Then Allah says, &#8216;I make  you witnesses that I have forgiven them.&#8221;&#8216; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;One of the  angels would say, &#8216;There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he  had just come for some need.&#8217; Allah would say, &#8216;These are those people whose companions  will not be reduced to misery.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

A man  (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice, &#8220;La ilaha  illal-lahu wallahu Akbar.&#8221; (At that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle was riding his mule.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one.&#8221; and  added, &#8220;O Abu Musa (or, O &#8216;Abdullah)!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I became sick so Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came on foot  to pay me a visit. When they came, I was unconscious. Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed ablution  and he poured over me the water (of his ablution) and I came to my senses and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall I do regarding my property? How shall I distribute  it?&#8221; The Prophet did not reply till the Divine Verses of inheritance were revealed . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 717: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Beware of suspicion, for it is the  worst of false tales and don&#8217;t look for the other&#8217;s faults and don&#8217;t spy and don&#8217;t hate  each other, and don&#8217;t desert (cut your relations with) one another O Allah&#8217;s slaves, be  brothers!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 90) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 718: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima and Al &#8216;Abbas came to Abu Bakr, seeking their share  from the property of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and at that time, they were asking for their land at  Fadak and their share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said to them, &#8221; I have heard from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Our property cannot be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be  spent in charity, but the family of Muhammad may take their provisions from this  property.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;By Allah, I will not leave the procedure I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle following during his lifetime concerning this property.&#8221; Therefore  Fatima left Abu Bakr and did not speak to him till she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 719: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Our (Apostles&#8217;) property should not  be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.080.720"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 720: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;I went and entered upon &#8216;Umar, his doorman, Yarfa came  saying &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d are asking your permission (to see you).  May I admit them? &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So he admitted them Then he came again and said, &#8216;May  I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O, chief of the believers! Judge  between me and this man (Ali ). &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I beseech you by Allah by Whose permission  both the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our (the  Apostles&#8217;) property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave (after our death) is to  be spent in charity?&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself.&#8217; The group said, &#8216;(No  doubt), he said so.&#8217; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8216;Do you both know that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;(No doubt), he said so.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;So let me  talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this Fai&#8217; (i.e.  booty won by the Muslims at war without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah gave to His Apostle ( Fai&#8217;  Booty) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;to do all things&#8230;.(59.6) And so that property was only for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . Yet, by Allah, he neither gathered that property for himself nor withheld it  from you, but he gave its income to you, and distributed it among you till there remained  the present property out of which the Prophet used to spend the yearly maintenance for his  family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s property is spent  (i.e. in charity etc.). Allah&#8217;s Apostle followed that throughout his life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know all that?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar then said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8216;I beseech you by Allah, do you know  that?&#8217; Both of them said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar added, &#8216;And when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;  I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and took charge of that property and managed it in  the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I took charge of this property for two years during  which I managed it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas)  came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You  came to me asking for your share from the property of your nephew, and this man (Ali) came  to me, asking for the share of h is wife from the property of her father. I said, &#8216;If you  both wish, I will give that to you on that condition (i.e. that you would follow the way  of the Prophet and Abu Bakr and as I (Umar) have done in man aging it).&#8217; Now both of you  seek of me a verdict other than that? Lo! By Allah, by Whose permission both the heaven  and the earth exist, I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is  established. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will be  sufficient to manage it on your behalf.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 721: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Not even a single Dinar of my  property should be distributed (after my deaths to my inheritors, but whatever I leave  excluding the provision for my wives and my servants, should be spent in charity.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, his wives  intended to send &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Aisha said to them, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah&#8217;s Apostle say, &#8216;Our (Apostles&#8217;) property is  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 723: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am more closer to the believers  than their own selves, so whoever (of them) dies while being in debt and leaves nothing  for its repayment, then we are to pay his debts on his behalf and whoever (among the  believers) dies leaving some property, then that property is for his heirs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Give the Fara&#8217;id (the shares of the  inheritance that are prescribed in the Qur&#8217;an) to those who are entitled to receive it.  Then whatever remains, should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased  .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 725: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was stricken by an ailment that led me to the verge of  death. The Prophet came to pay me a visit. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have much  property and no heir except my single daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my property in  charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One-third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You may do so) though  one-third is also to a much, for it is better for you to leave your off-spring wealthy  than to leave them poor, asking others for help. And whatever you spend (for Allah&#8217;s sake)  you will be rewarded for it, even for a morsel of food which you may put in the mouth of  your wife.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I remain behind and fail to  complete my emigration?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you are left behind after me,  whatever good deeds you will do for Allah&#8217;s sake, that will upgrade you and raise you  high. May be you will have long life so that some people may benefit by you and others  (the enemies) be harmed by you.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula  as he died in Mecca. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula was a man from the  tribe of Bani &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad bin Yazid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal came to us in Yemen as a tutor and a  ruler, and we (the people of Yemen) asked him about (the distribution of the property of )  a man who had died leaving a daughter and a sister. Mu&#8217;adh gave the daughter one-half of  the property and gave the sister the other half. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 727: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give the Fara&#8217;id (shares  prescribed in the Qur&#8217;an) to those who are entitled to receive it; and whatever remains,  should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 728: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Huzail bin Shirahbil: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa was asked regarding (the inheritance of) a  daughter, a son&#8217;s daughter, and a sister. He said, &#8220;The daughter will take one-half  and the sister will take one-half. If you go to Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, he will tell you the  same.&#8221; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud was asked and was told of Abu Musa&#8217;s verdict. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud then said,  &#8220;If I give the same verdict, I would stray and would not be of the rightly-guided.  The verdict I will give in this case, will be the same as the Prophet did, i.e. one-half  is for daughter, and one-sixth for the son&#8217;s daughter, i.e. both shares make two-thirds of  the total property; and the rest is for the sister.&#8221; Afterwards we cams to Abu Musa  and informed him of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud&#8217;s verdict, whereupon he said, &#8220;So, do not ask me for  verdicts, as long as this learned man is among you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The person about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I were  to take a Khalil from this nation (my followers), then I would have taken him (i.e., Abu  Bakr), but the Islamic Brotherhood is better (or said: good),&#8221; regarded a grandfather  as the father himself (in inheritance). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 731: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(During the early days of Islam), the inheritance used to  be given to one&#8217;s offspring and legacy used to be bequeathed to the parents, then Allah  cancelled what He wished from that order and decreed that the male should be given the  equivalent of the portion of two females, and for the parents one-sixth for each of them,  and for one&#8217;s wife one-eighth (if the deceased has children) and one-fourth (if he has no  children), for one&#8217;s husband one-half (if the deceased has no children) and one-fourth (if  she has children).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the judgment that a male or female  slave should be given in Qisas for an abortion case of a woman from the tribe of Bani  Lihyan (as blood money for the fetus) but the lady on whom the penalty had been imposed  died, so the Prophets ordered that her property be inherited by her offspring and her  husband and that the penalty be paid by her Asaba. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal gave this verdict for us in the lifetime  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One-half of the inheritance is to be given to the daughter and the  other half to the sister. Sulaiman said: Mu&#8217;adh gave a verdict for us, but he did not  mention that it was so in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 734: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Huzail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;The judgment I will give in this  matter will be like the judgment of the Prophet, i.e. one-half is for the daughter and  one-sixth for the son&#8217;s daughter and the rest of the inheritance for the sister.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sick, the Prophet entered upon me and asked for  some water to perform ablution, and after he had finished his ablution, he sprinkled some  water of his ablution over me, whereupon I became conscious and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have sisters.&#8221; Then the Divine Verses regarding the laws of inheritance  were revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The last Quranic Verse that was revealed (to the Prophet)  was the final Verse of Surat-an-Nisa, i.e., &#8216;They ask you for a legal verdict Say: Allah  directs (thus) About those who leave No descendants or ascendants as heirs&#8230;.&#8217; (4.176) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 737: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I am more closer to the  believers than their ownselves, so whoever (among them) dies leaving some inheritance, his  inheritance will be given to his &#8216;Asaba, and whoever dies leaving a debt or dependants or  destitute children, then I am their supporter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 739: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: regarding the Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And to  everyone, We have appointed heirs. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the emigrants came to Medina, the Ansar used to be the  heir of the emigrants (and vice versa) instead of their own kindred by blood  (Dhawl-l-arham), and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had  established between them, i.e. the Ansar and the emigrants. But when the Divine Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And to everyone We have appointed heirs,&#8217; (4.33) was  revealed, it cancelled the other, order i.e. &#8216;To those also, to whom Your right hands have  pledged.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man and his wife had a case of Lian (or Mula&#8217;ana) during  the lifetime of the Prophet and the man denied the paternity of her child.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Utba (bin Abi Waqqas) said to his brother Sa&#8217;d, &#8220;The  son of the slave girl of Zam&#8217;a is my son, so be his custodian.&#8221; So when it was the  year of the Conquest of Mecca, Sa&#8217;d took that child and said, &#8220;He is my nephew, and  my brother told me to be his custodian.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said,  &#8216;but the child is my brother, and the son of my father&#8217;s slave girl as he was born on his  bed.&#8221; So they both went to the Prophet. Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This is)  the son of my brother and he told me to be his custodian.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said,  &#8220;(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, born on his  bed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;This child is for you. O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a, as the child  is for the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones.&#8221; He then ordered  (his wife) Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba. Since then the boy had never seen Sauda till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I bought Barira (a female slave). The Prophet said (to me),  &#8220;Buy her as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; Once she was given a sheep (in  charity). The Prophet said, &#8220;It (the sheep) is a charitable gift for her (Barira) and  a gift for us.&#8221; Al-Hakam said, &#8220;Barira&#8217;s husband was a free man.&#8221; Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;When I saw him, he was a slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her  masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; (after her death) would be for them. &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her masters  stipulated that her Wala&#8217; will be for them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Manumit her as  the Wala is for the one who manumits (the slave),&#8221; or said, &#8220;The one who pays  her price.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha bought and manumitted her. After that, Barira was given the  choice (by the Prophet) (to stay with her husband or leave him). She said, &#8220;If he  gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him.&#8221; (Al-Aswad added: Her  husband was a free man.) The sub-narrator added: The series of the narrators of Al-Aswad&#8217;s  statement is incomplete. The statement of Ibn Abbas, i.e., when I saw him he was a slave,  is more authentic. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We have no Book to recite except the Book of Allah (Qur&#8217;an)  and this paper. Then &#8216;Ali took out the paper, and behold ! There was written in it, legal  verdicts about the retaliation for wounds, the ages of the camels (to be paid as Zakat or  as blood money). In it was also written: &#8216;Medina is a sanctuary from Air (mountain) to  Thaur (mountain). So whoever innovates in it an heresy (something new in religion) or  commits a crime in it or gives shelter to such an innovator, will incur the curse of  Allah, the angels and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds  will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever (a freed slave) takes as his  master (i.e. be-friends) some people other than hi real masters without the permission of  his real masters, will incur the curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and none  of his compulsory, or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And  the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the Muslims, even if it is  granted by one of the lowest social status among them; and whoever betrays a Muslim, in  this respect will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of  his Compulsory or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

The slave girl&#8217;s master said, &#8220;We are ready to  sell her to you on the condition that her Wala should be for us.&#8221; Aisha mentioned  that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8220;This (condition) should not prevent you from  buying her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits (the slave).&#8221; </font></p>

After that,  the Prophet caller her (Barira) and gave her the choice to go back to her husband or not.  She said, &#8220;If he gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him.&#8221;  So she selected her ownself (i.e. refused to go back to her husband).&#8221; </font></p>

This (boy) is the son of my brother, &#8216;Utba bin  Abi Waqqas who told me to be his custodian as he was his son. Please notice to whom he  bears affinity.&#8221; And &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;This is my brother, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! He was born on my father&#8217;s bed by his slave girl.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked  at the boy and noticed evident resemblance between him and &#8216;Utba, so he said, &#8220;He  (the toy) is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a, for the boy is for the owner of the bed, and the  stone is for the adulterer. Screen yourself before the boy, O Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha added: Since then he had never seen Sauda. </font></p>

Then both of them went to (the Prophet) Solomon,  son of David and informed him of the case. Solomon said, &#8216;Give me a knife so that I may  cut the child into two portions and give one half to each of you.&#8217; The younger lady said,  &#8216;Do not do so; may Allah bless you ! He is her child.&#8217; On that, he gave the child to the  younger lady.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: By Allah!

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 78:</p>
<h3 align="center">Oaths and Vows</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.078.618"></a>Volume 8, Book 78, Number 618:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Allah revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, &#8220;If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 619:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven&#8217;t got anything to mount you on.&#8221; Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath).&#8221; When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, &#8220;I did not give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last in the world, but will be foremost on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also said, &#8220;By Allah, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allah&#8217;s sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed, and insists on keeping it, he surely commits a sin greater (than that of dissolving his oath). He should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army detachment and made Usama bin Zaid its commander. Some people criticized (spoke badly of) Usama&#8217;s leadership. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;If you people are criticizing Usama&#8217;s leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Allah), he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to me; and now this (his son Usama) is one of the dearest persons to me after him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 745, Vol. 5)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 624:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oath of the Prophet used to be: &#8220;No, by Him who turns the hearts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him; and if Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau, after him; and, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau after him; and if Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 627:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O followers of Muhammad! By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 628:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet and he was holding the hand of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar said to Him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You are dearer to me than everything except my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, (you will not have complete faith) till I am dearer to you than your own self.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;However, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Now, O &#8216;Umar, (now you are a believer).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 629:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men had a dispute in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One of them said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The other who was wiser, said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and allow me to speak. The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws: As for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you.&#8221; Then he scourged his son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think if the tribes of Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaina and Juhaina are better than the tribes of Tamim, &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;sa&#8217;a, Ghatfan and Asad, they (the second group) are despairing and losing?&#8221; They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Yes, (they are).&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, they (the first group) are better than them (the second group).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me as a present.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay at your father&#8217;s or mother&#8217;s house and see if you would be given presents or not?&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and praised and glorified Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then ! What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, &#8216;This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present&#8217;? Why didn&#8217;t he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I have preached you (Allah&#8217;s Message).&#8221; Abu Humaid said, &#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 632:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet) said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if you know that which I know, you would weep much and laugh little.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reached him (the Prophet ) while in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba; he was saying, &#8220;They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba! They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; I said (to myself ), &#8220;What is wrong with me? Is anything improper detected in me? What is wrong with me? Then I sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement. I could not remain quiet, and Allah knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, &#8216; Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Allah&#8217;s Cause).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 634:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Solomon once said, &#8216;Tonight I will sleep with ninety women, each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On this, his companion said to him, &#8220;Say: Allah willing!&#8221; But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, &#8216;Allah willing&#8217; (all his wives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause as cavaliers. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 635:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara &#8216;bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A piece of silken cloth was given to the Prophet as a present and the people handed it over amongst themselves and were astonished at its beauty and softness. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Are you astonished at it?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the handkerchiefs of Sa&#8217;d in Paradise are better than it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 636:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba bin Rabi &#8216;a said, &#8220;O Allah &#8216;s Apostle! (Before I embraced Islam), there was no family on the surface of the earth, I wish to have degraded more than I did your family. But today there is no family whom I wish to have honored more than I did yours.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I thought similarly, by Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is!&#8221; Hind said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (My husband) Abu Sufyan is a miser. Is it sinful of me to feed my children from his property?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, unless you take it for your needs what is just and reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 637:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting, reclining his back against a Yemenite leather tent he said to his companions, &#8220;Will you be pleased to be one-fourth of the people of Paradise?&#8221; They said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be pleased to be one-third of the people of Paradise&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, I hope that you will be one-half of the people of Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 638:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man heard another man reciting: Surat-ul-Ikhlas (The Unity) &#8216;Say: He is Allah, the One (112) and he was repeating it. The next morning he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the whole story to him as if he regarded the recitation of that Sura as insufficient On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! That (Sura No. 112) equals one-third of the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Perform the bowing and the prostration properly (with peace of mind), for, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I see you from behind my back when you bow and when you prostrate.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 640:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An Ansari woman came to the Prophet in the company of her children, and the Prophet said to her, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, you are the most beloved people to me!&#8221; And he repeated the statement thrice.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 641:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab while the latter was going with a group of camel-riders, and he was swearing by his father. The Prophet said, &#8220;Lo! Allah forbids you to swear by your fathers, so whoever has to take an oath, he should swear by Allah or keep quiet.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 642:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 644:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a relation of love and brotherhood between this tribe of Jarm and Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin. Once we were with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari, and then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was present, a man from the tribe of Taimillah who was of red complexion as if he were from non-Arab freed slaves. Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, &#8220;I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken.&#8221; On that, Abu Musa said, &#8220;Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash&#8217;ariyin and I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, &#8216;Where are the Ash-&#8216;ariyin?&#8217; He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Allah, we will never succeed.&#8217; So we went back to him and said to him, &#8216;We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.&#8217; On that he said, &#8216;I did not provide you with mounts, but Allah did. By Allah, if I take an oath to do something, and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better and make expiation for the dissolution of the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

She said, (in the message); My child is going to die; please come to us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned the messenger and told him to convey his greetings to her, and say, &#8220;Whatever Allah takes, is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world): so she should be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; Then she again sent for him swearing that he should come; so The Prophet got up, and so did we. When he sat there (at the house of his daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took him into his lap while the child&#8217;s breath was disturbed in his chest. The eyes of Allah&#8217;s Apostle started shedding tears. Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of whoever He wants of His slaves, and verily Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the last part of his narration about the three who remained behind (from the battle of Tabuk). (I said) &#8220;As a proof of my true repentance (for not joining the Holy battle of Tabuk), I shall give up all my property for the sake of Allah and His Apostle (as an expiation for that sin).&#8221; The Prophet said (to me), &#8220;Keep some of your wealth, for that is better for you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, &#8220;I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8221; When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), &#8220;No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.&#8221; Then the following verse was revealed: &#8216;O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you?. ..(up to) If you two (wives of the Prophet turn in repentance to Allah.&#8217; (66.1-4) The two were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa And also the Statement of Allah: &#8216;And (Remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives!&#8217; (66.3) i.e., his saying, &#8220;But I have drunk honey.&#8221; Hisham said: It also meant his saying, &#8220;I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that &#8216;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;The vow, does not bring about for the son of Adam anything I have not decreed for him, but his vow may coincide with what has been decided for him, and by this way I cause a miser to spend of his wealth. So he gives Me (spends in charity) for the fulfillment of what has been decreed for him what he would not give Me before but for his vow.&#8221;</p>

He added, &#8216;Then will come some people who will make vows but will not fulfill them; and they will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy, and they will give their witness without being asked to give their witness, and fatness will appear among them.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from the tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to the Prophet and  embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet cut off the hands and feet of the men belonging  to the tribe of &#8216;Uraina and did not cauterise (their bleeding limbs) till they died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 796: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 797: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 798: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever guarantees me (the chastity  of) what is between his legs (i.e. his private parts), and what is between his jaws (i.e.,  his tongue), I guarantee him Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate  to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The Hour  sill not be established&#8221; or said: &#8220;From among the portents of the Hour is that  the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general  ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very  common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in  number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one  man to look after them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima from Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostles said, &#8220;When a slave (of Allah)  commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and  if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic  drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when  he commits a murder,&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said: I asked Ibn Abbas, &#8220;How is faith taken away  from him?&#8221; He said, Like this,&#8221; by clasping his hands and then separating them,  and added, &#8220;But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands  again. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who commits an illegal  sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse  and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic  drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open  thereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which is the biggest  sin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To set up rivals to Allah by worshipping others though He alone  has created you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your  child lest it should share your food.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet asked them. &#8220;What is  the legal punishment (for this sin) in your Book (Torah)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Our  priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and  Tajbiya.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, tell them to bring the  Torah.&#8221; The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine  Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed  it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Ma&#8217;iz bin Malik came to the Prophet (in order to  confess), the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Probably you have only kissed (the lady), or  winked, or looked at her?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, using no euphemism, &#8220;Did you have sexual intercourse with her?&#8221; The  narrator added: At that, (i.e. after his confession) the Prophet ordered that he be stoned  (to death). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man from among the people, came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting in the mosque, and addressed him, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have committed an illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet turned his face  away from him. The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have committed an illegal intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet  turned his face to the other side, and the man came to that side, and when he confessed  four times, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes,  O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said (to the people), &#8220;Take him away and stone  him to death.&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;I was told by one who heard Jabir, that Jabir  said, &#8216;I was among those who stoned the man, and we stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying  Place), and when the stones troubled him, he jumped quickly and ran away, but we overtook  him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death (there).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with the Prophet , a man stood up and said  (to the Prophet ), &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, that you should judge us according to  Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then the man&#8217;s opponent who was wiser than him, got up saying (to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Law and kindly allow me (to  speak).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer  working for this man and he committed an illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I  gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom for my son&#8217;s sin. Then I asked a learned  man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and  be exiled for one year, and the man&#8217;s wife should be stoned to death.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of  Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to  receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais! Go to the wife of this  man, and if she confesses, then stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to her and she  confessed. He then stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I am afraid that after a long time has  passed, people may say, &#8220;We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in  the Holy Book,&#8221; and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that  Allah has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who  commits illegal sexual intercourse, if he is already married and the crime is proved by  witnesses or pregnancy or confession.&#8221; Sufyan added, &#8220;I have memorized this  narration in this way.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Surely Allah&#8217;s Apostle carried out the  penalty of Rajam, and so did we after him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 817: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Give your verdict according to Allah&#8217;s Laws  (in our case).&#8221; Then his opponent got up and said, &#8220;He has told the truth, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais! Go to the wife of this  man (and if she confesses), stone her to death.&#8221; So Unais went in the morning and  stoned her to death (after she had confessed). </font></p>

One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before  and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Where he  lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &#8220;O Muhammad! He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;My wife  has delivered a black child.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Have you camels?&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What color are they?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;They are red.&#8221; The Prophet further asked, &#8220;Are any of them gray  in color?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Whence did that  grayness come?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I thing it descended from the camel&#8217;s ancestors.&#8221;  Then the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Therefore, this child of yours has most probably  inherited the color from his ancestors.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade Al-Wisal (fasting continuously for  more than one day without taking any meals). A man from the Muslims said, &#8220;But you do  Al-Wisal, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle I said, &#8220;Who among you is similar  to me? I sleep and my Lord makes me eat and drink.&#8221; When the people refused to give  up Al-Wisal, the Prophet fasted along with them for one day, and did not break his fast  but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet said,  &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a  third day),&#8221; as if he wanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle never took revenge for his own self in any  matter presented to him till Allah&#8217;s limits were exceeded, in which case he would take  revenge for Allah&#8217;s sake. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged  his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The  Prophet ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, &#8220;If I kept her, I would  be a liar.&#8221; I remember that Az-Zubair also said, &#8220;(It was said) that if that  woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove  truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red  insect), he would prove untruthful.&#8221; I heard Az-Zubair also saying, &#8220;Finally she  gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the couple who had taken the oath of  Lian. &#8216;Abdullah bin Shaddad said (to him), &#8220;Was this woman about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;If I were ever to stone to death any woman without witnesses. (I would have stoned  that woman to death)?&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas replied,&#8221; No, that lady exposed herself (by her  suspicious behavior).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Lian was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet, Asim bin  Adi said a statement about it, and when he left, a man from his tribe came to him  complaining that he had seen a man with his wife. Asim said, &#8220;I have been put to  trial only because of my statement.&#8221; So he took the man to the Prophet and the man  told him about the incident. The man (husband) was of yellow complexion, thin, and of lank  hair, while the man whom he had accused of having been with his wife, was reddish brown  with fat thick legs and fat body. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8221;  Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of  having been with her. So the Prophet made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn  Abbas in the gathering, &#8220;Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet said, &#8220;If  I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without  witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;No, that  was another lady who used to behave in such a suspicious way among the Muslims that one  might accuse her of committing illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

What are they?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to practice sorcery; to kill the life  which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law); to eat up  usury (Riba), to eat up the property of an orphan; to give one&#8217;s back to the enemy and  freeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and to accuse chaste women who never  even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I beseech you to  judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up  and said, &#8220;He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and please  allow me (to speak), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom  (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they  informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year,  and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).&#8221;The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The  one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife  of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death.&#8221; She confessed and  he stoned her to death. </font></p>

Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>

This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which sin is the  greatest in Allah&#8217;s Sight?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To set up a rival unto Allah  though He Alone created you . &#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; The man said,  &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse  with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; So Allah revealed in confirmation of this  narration:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And those who invoke not with Allah, any other god. Nor  kill, such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause nor commit illegal sexual  intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment.&#8217; (25.68) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A faithful believer remains at  liberty regarding his religion unless he kills somebody unlawfully.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One of the evil deeds with bad consequence from which there  is no escape for the one who is involved in it is to kill someone unlawfully. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 4: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The first cases to be decided among  the people (on the Day of Resurrection) will be those of blood-shed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 5: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr Al-Kindi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An ally of Bani Zuhra who took part in the battle of Badr  with the Prophet, that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I meet an unbeliever and we  have a fight, and he strikes my hand with the sword and cuts it off, and then takes refuge  from me under a tree, and says, &#8216;I have surrendered to Allah (i.e. embraced Islam),&#8217; may I  kill him after he has said so?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not kill him.&#8221;  Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;But O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he  said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said. &#8220;Do not  kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you  kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the  sentence.&#8221; The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, &#8220;If a faithful believer conceals  his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill  him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at  Mecca before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No human being is killed unjustly,  but a part of responsibility for the crime is laid on the first son of Adam who invented  the tradition of killing (murdering) on the earth. (It is said that he was Qabil). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said during Hajjat-al-Wada&#8217;, &#8220;Let the  people be quiet and listen to me. After me, do not become disbelievers, by striking  (cutting) the necks of one another.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Al-Kaba&#8217;ir (the biggest sins) are:  To join others (as partners) in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one&#8217;s  parents,&#8221; or said, &#8220;to take a false oath.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Shu&#8217;ba is not  sure) Mu&#8217;adh said: Shu&#8217;ba said, &#8220;Al-kaba&#8217;ir (the biggest sins) are: (1) Joining  others as partners in worship with Allah, (2) to take a false oath (3) and to be undutiful  to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; or said, &#8220;to murder (someone unlawfully). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The biggest of Al-Kaba&#8217;ir (the  great sins) are (1) to join others as partners in worship with Allah, (2) to murder a  human being, (3) to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents (4) and to make a false statement,&#8221;  or said, &#8220;to give a false witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 11: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama bin Zaid bin Haritha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us (to fight) against Al-Huraqa (one  of the sub-tribes) of Juhaina. We reached those people in the morning and defeated them. A  man from the Ansar and I chased one of their men and when we attacked him, he said,  &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; The Ansari refrained from  killing him but I stabbed him with my spear till I killed him. When we reached (Medina),  this news reached the Prophet. He said to me, &#8220;O Usama! You killed him after he had  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! He said so in order to save himself.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You killed him  after he had said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; The Prophet kept  on repeating that statement till I wished I had not been a Muslim before that day. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.012"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 12: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samat: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was among those Naqibs (selected leaders) who gave the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. We gave the oath of allegiance, that we would not  join partners in worship besides Allah, would not steal, would not commit illegal sexual  intercourse, would not kill a life which Allah has forbidden, would not commit robbery,  would not disobey (Allah and His Apostle), and if we fulfilled this pledge we would have  Paradise, but if we committed any one of these (sins), then our case will be decided by  Allah. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 14: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to help that man (i.e., &#8216;Ali), and on the way I met  Abu Bakra who asked me, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am going to  help that man.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go back, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If two  Muslims meet each other with their swords then (both) the killer and the killed one are in  the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is alright for the killer, but what about  the killed one?&#8217; He said, &#8216;The killed one was eager to kill his opponent.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.015"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 15: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones, and  the girl was asked, &#8220;Who has done that to you, so-and-so or so and so?&#8221; (Some  names were mentioned for her) till the name of that Jew was mentioned (whereupon she  agreed). The Jew was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet kept on questioning him till  he confessed, whereupon his head was crushed with stones. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.016"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 16: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A girl wearing ornaments, went out at Medina. Somebody  struck her with a stone. She was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle asked her, &#8220;Did such-and-such a person strike you?&#8221; She raised her head,  denying that. He asked her a second time, saying, &#8220;Did so-and-so strike you?&#8221;  She raised her head, denying that. He said for the third time, &#8220;Did so-and-so strike  you?&#8221; She lowered her head, agreeing. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then sent for the killer and  killed him between two stones. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.017"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 17: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The blood of a Muslim who  confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle,  cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits  illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.018"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 18: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew killed a girl so that he may steal her ornaments. He  struck her with a stone, and she was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive. The  Prophet asked her, &#8220;Did such-and-such person strike you?&#8221; She gestured with her  head, expressing denial. He asked her for the second time, and she again gestured with her  head, expressing denial. When he asked her for the third time, she beckoned,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So the Prophet killed him (the Jew) with two stones. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.019"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 19: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them  in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;Allah held  back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers  overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in  Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after  me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is  at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not  be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who  would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to  choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer  killed.&#8221; Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood up and said, &#8220;Write that)  for me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to his companions), &#8220;Write  that for Abu Shah.&#8221; Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for  graves.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-idhkkir.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.020"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 20: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was  Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was  not permitted as an alternate. But Allah said to this nation (Muslims): &#8216;O you who  believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, &#8230;..(up to) &#8230;end of the Verse.  (2.178) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse,  means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: The Verse:  &#8216;Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.&#8217; (2.178) means that  the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude. </font></p>

Let us hear some of your Huda (camel-driving  songs.)&#8221; So he sang some of them (i.e. a lyric in harmony with the camels walk). The  Prophet said, &#8220;Who is the driver (of these camels)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Amir.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on him !&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you let us enjoy his company  longer!&#8221; Then &#8216;Amir was killed the following morning.

The people claim that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s good deeds are lost.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so is a liar, for &#8216;Amir will have a double reward as he  exerted himself to obey Allah and fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause. No other way of killing would  have granted him greater reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qilaba: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz sat on his throne in the  courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him. Then he admitted them  and (when they came in), he said, &#8220;What do you think of Al-Qasama?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;We say that it is lawful to depend on Al-Qasama in Qisas, as the previous Muslim  Caliphs carried out Qisas depending on it.&#8221; Then he said to me, &#8220;O Abu Qilaba!  What do you say about it?&#8221; He let me appear before the people and I said, &#8220;O  Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs.  If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in  Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in  Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one  of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed  (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man  who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&#8221;  Then the people said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle cut off the  hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&#8221; I said,  &#8220;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &#8220;Eight persons from the  tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became  Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and  complained about that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &#8220;Won&#8217;t you go out with  the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine)?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So they went out and drank the camels&#8217; milk and urine, and  after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and took away all  the camels. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces  and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands  and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them  in the sun till they died.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What can be worse than what those people  did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Anbasa bin Said said, &#8220;By Allah, I never heard a  narration like this of today.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O &#8216;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&#8221;  &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be  related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is  among them.&#8221; I added, &#8220;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed  some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people  went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we have found our companion who  had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went out and asked them, &#8220;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed  him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We think that the Jews have killed him.&#8221; The Prophet sent  for the Jews and asked them, &#8220;Did you kill this (person)?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked the Al-Ansars, &#8220;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an  oath that they have not killed him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It matters little for the Jews  to kill us all and then take false oaths.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then would you like to  receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your  man)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not take the oath.&#8221; Then the Prophet himself  paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;The tribe of Hudhail  repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, at a place called Al-Batha&#8217; (near Mecca), the man  attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed  him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured  the Yemenite and brought him to &#8216;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &#8220;He has killed  our companion.&#8221; The Yemenite said, &#8220;But these people had repudiated him (i.e.,  their companion).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had  not repudiated him.&#8221; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging  to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid  one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him  and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &#8220;We  and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a  place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the  cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the  two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on  the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year  and then died.&#8221; I further said, &#8220;&#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to  death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but  later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who  had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in  Sham.&#8221; </font></p>

So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him, he said (to him), &#8220;If  I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your  eye with this (sharp iron bar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The asking for  permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there  is in the house without the permission of its people).&#8221; </font></p>

The relatives of  the killer and the relatives of the victim submitted their case to the Prophet who judged  that the Diya for the fetus was a male or female slave, and the Diya for the killed woman  was to be paid by the &#8216;Asaba (near relatives) of the killer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina,  Abu Talha took hold of my hand and brought me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Anas is an intelligent boy, so let him serve you.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;So I  served the Prophet L at home and on journeys; by Allah, he never said to me for anything  which I did: Why have you done this like this or, for anything which I did not do: &#8216;Why  have you not done this like this?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew whose face had been slapped (by someone), came to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad!

They called him and the Prophet asked him,  &#8220;Why did you slap his face?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! While I was  passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, &#8216;By Him Who chose Moses above all the human  beings.&#8217; I said (protestingly), &#8216;Even above Muhammad?&#8217; So I became furious and slapped  him.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the  people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain  conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of the pillars of the Throne (of  Allah). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me or he has been  exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) which he  received.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Interpretation of Dreams </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.087.111">Volume 9, Book 87, Number 111: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream  but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira  where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take  with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take  his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended  upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to  read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; (The Prophet added),  &#8220;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it  anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read,&#8221; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I  could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I  replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&#8221; Thereupon he  caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &#8220;Read: In  the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot.  Read and Your Lord is Most Generous&#8230;up to&#8230;.. ..that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.15) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his  neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &#8220;Cover me!  Cover me!&#8221; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &#8220;O Khadija,  what is wrong with me?&#8221; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &#8216;I  fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija said, &#8216;Never! But have the glad  tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your  Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest  generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; Khadija then  accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza bin Qusai.  Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&#8217;s brother, who during the  Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to  write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and  had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your  nephew.&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet  described whatever he had seen. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel,  the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and  could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked, &#8220;Will they turn me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said:  &#8220;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated  with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I  would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard  that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every  time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear  before him and say, &#8220;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&#8217;s Apostle in truth&#8221;  whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And  whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as  before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him  and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &#8216;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &#8216;He it  is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&#8217; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of  the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night). </font></p>

I testify that Allah has honored you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;How  do you know that?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I do not know, by Allah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for him, death has  come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I  neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'&#8221; Um Al-&#8216;Ala said, &#8220;By Allah, I  will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Later I  saw in a dream, a flowing spring for &#8216;Uthman. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned  that to him. He said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his good deeds (the reward for) which is  going on for him.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Men from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to see  dreams during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man  and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, &#8220;If there were  any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.&#8221; So when I went to bed one  night, I said, &#8220;O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.&#8221; So  while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each  of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was  between them, invoking Allah, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.&#8221; Then  I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said  to me, &#8220;Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more  often.&#8221; So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was  built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post  there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down  with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels)  took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No doubt, &#8216;Abdullah is a good man.&#8221;  (Nafi&#8217; said, &#8220;Since then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to pray much.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young unmarried man during the lifetime of the  Prophet. I used to sleep in the mosque. Anyone who had a dream, would narrate it to the  Prophet. I said, &#8220;O Allah! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream  so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may interpret it for me.&#8221; So I slept and saw (in a dream) two  angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, you are a good man.&#8221; They took me towards the Fire, and  behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I  recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned  that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet and he said,  &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah is a righteous man if he only prays more at night.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said,  &#8220;After that, &#8216;Abdullah used to pray more at night.&#8221;) </font></p>

And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah is better (than  worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)  on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good  and the reward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the  Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Allah in the Battle of Khaibar and  the conquest of Mecca) . </font></p>

And behold, there was  a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (the Prophet) held it and  went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) held it  and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got  connected again.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&#8217;s head, injuring it. The rock  rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back.

Who are these two persons?&#8217; They said,  &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man  standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of  the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly  tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the  other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly  completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to  it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are  these two persons?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something  like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&#8221; I  think the Prophet said, &#8220;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame  of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly.  I asked them, &#8216;Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; And so we proceeded and came  across a river.&#8221; I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;. red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man  who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him.  The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth  whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated,  I asked my two companions, &#8216;Who are these (two) persons?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed!  Proceed!&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most  repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was  kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &#8216;Who is this (man)?&#8217; They said  to me, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense  vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very  tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there  were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &#8216;Who  is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic  huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &#8216;Go  up and I went up&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;So we ascended till we reached a city built of  gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the  gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of  their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side  as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to  throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and  its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then  returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the  best shape.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;My two companions (angels) said to me,  &#8216;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and  behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &#8216;That  (palace) is your place.&#8217; I said to them, &#8216;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to  them, &#8216;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being  injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither  recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the  man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to  back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so  many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw  in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and  the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of  usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going  round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is  Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic  Faith).&#8221; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What about the children of pagans?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;And also the children  of pagans.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;My two companions added, &#8216;The men you saw half  handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another  that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&#8221; </font></p>

Tie the mouth of your water-skin and mention  Allah&#8217;s Name; cover your containers and utensils and mention Allah&#8217;s Name. Cover them even  by placing something across it, and extinguish your lamps. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Arab lady was mentioned to the Prophet so he asked Abu  Usaid As-Sa&#8217;idi to send for her, and he sent for her and she came and stayed in the castle  of Bani Sa&#8217;ida. The Prophet came out and went to her and entered upon her. Behold, it was  a lady sitting with a drooping head. When the Prophet spoke to her, she said, &#8220;I seek  refuge with Allah from you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I grant you refuge from me.&#8221; They  said to her, &#8220;Do you know who this is?&#8221; She said, &#8220;No.&#8221; They said,  &#8220;This is Allah&#8217;s Apostle who has come to command your hand in marriage.&#8221; She  said, &#8220;I am very unlucky to lose this chance.&#8221; Then the Prophet and his  companions went towards the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;ida and sat there. Then he said, &#8220;Give us  water, O Sahl!&#8221; So I took out this drinking bowl and gave them water in it. The  sub-narrator added: Sahl took out for us that very drinking bowl and we all drank from it.  Later on Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz requested Sahl to give it to him as a present, and he gave  it to him as a present. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the drinking bowl of the Prophet with Anas bin Malik,  and it had been broken, and he had mended it with silver plates. That drinking bowl was  quite wide and made of Nadar wood, Anas said, &#8220;I gave water to the Prophet in that  bowl more than so-and-so (for a long period).&#8221; Ibn Sirin said: Around that bowl there  was an iron ring, and Anas wanted to replace it with a silver or gold ring, but Abu Talha  said to him, &#8220;Do not change a thing that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has made.&#8221; So Anas left  it as it was. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was with the Prophet and the time for the &#8216;Asr prayer  became due. We had no water with us except a little which was put in a vessel and was  brought to the Prophet . He put his hand into it and spread out his fingers and then said,  &#8220;Come along! Hurry up! All those who want to perform ablution. The blessing is from  Allah.&#8221; I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed the  ablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and  capacity), for I knew that it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir,  &#8220;How many persons were you then?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We were one-thousand four  hundred men.&#8221; Salim said: Jabir said, 1500. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Verse: &#8216;It is those who believe and confuse not  their belief with wrong (i.e., worshipping others besides Allah): (6.82) was revealed, it  became very hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, &#8220;Who among us has  not confused his belief with wrong (oppression)?&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;This is not meant (by the Verse). Don&#8217;t you listen to Luqman&#8217;s statement: &#8216;Verily!  Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.&#8217; (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet. said, &#8220;The biggest of the great sins are:  To join others in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents, and to give a  false witness.&#8221; He repeated it thrice, or said, &#8220;&#8230;.a false statement,&#8221;  and kept on repeating that warning till we wished he would stop saying it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa said, &#8220;I came to the Prophet along with two  men (from the tribe) of Ash&#8217;ariyin, one on my right and the other on my left, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was brushing his teeth (with a Siwak), and both men asked him for some  employment. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Abu Musa (O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!).&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Him Who  sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did  not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.&#8217; As if I were looking now at his  Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, &#8216;We never (or, we do not)  appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais!) Go to Yemen.'&#8221; The Prophet then sent Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal after him and when  Mu&#8217;adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit  on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu&#8217;adh asked,  &#8220;Who is this (man)?&#8221; Abu Muisa said, &#8220;He was a Jew and became a Muslim and  then reverted back to Judaism.&#8221; Then Abu Muisa requested Mu&#8217;adh to sit down but  Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of  Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that  the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, &#8220;Then we discussed the night  prayers and one of us said, &#8216;I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allah will reward me for my  sleep as well as for my prayers.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and  some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! How can you fight  these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered to fight the people till  they say: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, &#8216;and whoever said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;, Allah will save his property and his life from me,  unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account  will be with Allah?&#8217; &#8220;Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight whoever  differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property  (according to Allah&#8217;s Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to  pay to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards  the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8216;As-Samu  &#8216;Alaika.'&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Allah is kind and lenient and likes that one should be kind and  lenient in all matters.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard what they said?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I said (to them), &#8216;Wa &#8216;Alaikum (and upon you). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by  Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if  I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I  may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying,  &#8220;During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the  best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith)  and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So,  where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day  of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was distributing (something, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Dhil Khawaisira At-Tamimi came and said, &#8220;Be just, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin  Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Allow me to cut off his neck ! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221;  Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and  your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison  to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game&#8217;s body  in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and  when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined,  nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood.  The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast)  will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will  appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims).&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id added: I  testify that I heard this from the Prophet and also testify that &#8216;Ali killed those people  while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet was brought to  &#8216;Ali. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira At-Tarnimi): &#8216;And among them are men who accuse you (O  Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.&#8217; (9.58) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Hibban bin &#8216;Atiyya had a dispute. Abu  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said to Hibban, &#8220;You know what made your companions (i.e. Ali) dare to  shed blood.&#8221; Hibban said, &#8220;Come on! What is that?&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said,  &#8220;Something I heard him saying.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;What was it?&#8221;  &#8216;AbdurRahman said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu  Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, &#8216;Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama  said that Abu &#8216;Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a  letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.&#8217;  So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib had  written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Allah&#8217;s Apostle against them. We  asked her, &#8220;Where is the letter which is with you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t got any  letter.&#8217; So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8216;We do not think that she has got a letter.&#8217; I said, &#8216;We  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not told a lie.'&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Ali took an oath saying, &#8220;By Him by Whom one  should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your  clothes.&#8221; She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and  brought out the paper (letter). They took the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me  chop off his neck!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What obliged you to do what  you have done?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why (for what reason) should  I not believe in Allah and His Apostle? But I intended to do the (Mecca) people a favor by  virtue of which my family and property may be protected as there is none of your  companions but has some of his people (relatives) whom Allah urges to protect his family  and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has said the truth; therefore, do not say  anything to him except good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has  betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Allah  might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), &#8216;Do what you like, for I  have granted you Paradise?&#8217; &#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar&#8217;s eyes became flooded with tears and he  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people were sick and they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give us shelter and food. So when they became healthy they said, &#8220;The weather of Medina is not suitable for us.&#8221; So he sent them to Al-Harra with some she-camels of his and said, &#8220;Drink of their milk.&#8221; But when they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away his camels. The Prophet sent some people in their pursuit. Then he got their hands and feet cut and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. I saw one of them licking the earth with his tongue till he died.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet ordered them to follow his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they followed the shepherd that is the camels and drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the Prophet he sent some people in their pursuit. When they were brought, he cut their hands and feet and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron.</p>

Ibn Abi &#8216;Atiq came to visit him and said to us, &#8220;Treat him with black cumin. Take five or seven seeds and crush them (mix the powder with oil) and drop the resulting mixture into both nostrils, for &#8216;Aisha has narrated to me that she heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;This black cumin is healing for all diseases except As-Sam.&#8217; Aisha said, &#8216;What is As-Sam?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Death.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Treat with the Indian incense, for it has healing for seven diseases; it is to be sniffed by one having throat trouble, and to be put into one side of the mouth of one suffering from pleurisy.&#8221; Once I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with a son of mine who would not eat any food, and the boy passed urine on him whereupon he asked for some water and sprinkled it over the place of urine.</p>

There was a multitude filling the horizon,&#8217; It was said to me, &#8216;This is your nation out of whom seventy thousand shall enter Paradise without reckoning.&#8217; &#8220;Then the Prophet entered his house without telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So the people started talking about the issue and said, &#8220;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. &#8220;Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &#8221; On that &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &#8220;Am I one of them, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the helmet broke on the head of the Prophet and his face became covered with blood and his incisor tooth broke (i.e. during the battle of Uhud), &#8216;Ali used to bring water in his shield while Fatima was washing the blood off his face. When Fatima saw that the bleeding increased because of the water, she took a mat (of palm leaves), burnt it, and stuck it (the burnt ashes) on the wound of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whereupon the bleeding stopped.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people from the tribes of &#8216;Ukl and &#8216;Uraina came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and embraced Islam and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers,&#8221; and they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they be given some camels and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet ordered that their eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in that state.</p>

Those people differed in their opinions. Some of them said, &#8220;We have come out for a purpose and we do not think that it is proper to give it up,&#8221; while others said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;You have along with you. other people and the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so do not advise that we take them to this epidemic.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said to them, &#8220;Leave me now.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Call the Ansar for me.&#8221; I called them and he consulted them and they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they did. He then said to them, Leave me now,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest of Mecca.&#8221; I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, &#8220;We advise that you should return with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar made an announcement, &#8220;I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Would that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu &#8216;Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don&#8217;t you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?&#8221; At that time &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, &#8220;I have some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If you hear about it (an outbreak of plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not run away from it.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina.</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.645"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, &#8220;Will you go to the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?&#8221; They came to them and said, &#8220;O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages.&#8221; Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Distribute (the sheep).&#8221; But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, &#8220;Do not do that till we go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us.&#8221; So they came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the story to him and he said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.&#8221;</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.648"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once came out to us and said, &#8220;Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, &#8216;This is Moses and his followers.&#8217; Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look&#8221; I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It was said, &#8220;Look this way and that way.&#8217; So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8220;These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (being asked about their) accounts. &#8221; Then the people dispersed and the Prophet did not tell who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of them said, &#8220;As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.&#8221; That talk reached the Prophet who said, &#8220;These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.&#8221; then &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am I one of those (70,000)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

One of them said to his companion, &#8220;What is the disease of this man?&#8221; The other replied, &#8220;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Who has worked the magic on him?&#8217; The other replied, &#8220;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;What material did he use?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;A comb and the hairs stuck to it and the skin of pollen of a male date palm.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;(That is) in the well of Dharwan;&#8217; &#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some of his companions went there and came back saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha, the color of its water is like the infusion of Henna leaves. The tops of the date-palm trees near it are like the heads of the devils.&#8221; I asked. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? Why did you not show it (to the people)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Since Allah cured me, I disliked to let evil spread among the people.&#8221; Then he ordered that the well be filled up with earth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Magic was worked on Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not (Sufyan said: That is the hardest kind of magic as it has such an effect). Then one day he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?&#8217; The latter replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has worked magic on him?&#8217; The other replied Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam, a man from Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a hypocrite.&#8217; The first one asked, What material did he use)?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;A comb and the hair stuck to it.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Where (is that)?&#8217; The other replied. &#8216;In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan&#8217; &#8221; So the Prophet went to that well and took out those things and said &#8220;That was the well which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then that thing was taken out&#8217; I said (to the Prophet ) &#8220;Why do you not treat yourself with Nashra?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Magic was worked on Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he began to imagine that he had done something although he had not. One day while he was with me, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period and then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!

Then he returned to me and said, &#8216;By Allah the water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palms were like the heads of devils&#8221; I said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?&#8221; He said, &#8216;No! As for me Allah has healed me and cured me and I was afraid that (by Showing that to the people) I would spread evil among them when he ordered that the well be filled up with earth, and it was filled up with earth &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.073">Volume 9, Book 85, Number 73: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abi Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to invoke Allah in his prayer, &#8220;O  Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a and Salama bin Hisham and Al-Walid bin Al-Walid; O  Allah! Save the weak among the believers; O Allah! Be hard upon the tribe of Mudar and  inflict years (of famine) upon them like the (famine) years of Joseph.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.074"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 74: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever possesses the  (following) three qualities will have the sweetness of faith (1): The one to whom Allah  and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything else; (2) Who loves a person and he loves him  only for Allah&#8217;s Sake; (3) who hates to revert to atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be  thrown into the Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.075"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 75: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid saying, &#8220;I have seen myself  tied and forced by &#8216;Umar to leave Islam (Before &#8216;Umar himself embraced Islam). And if the  mountain of Uhud were to collapse for the evil which you people had done to &#8216;Uthman, then  Uhud would have the right to do so.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 202, Vol. 5) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.076"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 76: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Art: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (about our state) while he  was leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba. We said, &#8220;Will you ask  Allah to help us? Will you invoke Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among those who were  before you a (believer) used to be seized and, a pit used to be dug for him and then he  used to be placed in it. Then a saw used to be brought and put on his head which would be  split into two halves. His flesh might be combed with iron combs and removed from his  bones, yet, all that did not cause him to revert from his religion. By Allah! This  religion (Islam) will be completed (and triumph) till a rider (traveler) goes from San&#8217;a&#8217;  (the capital of Yemen) to Hadramout fearing nobody except Allah and the wolf lest it  should trouble his sheep, but you are impatient.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 191, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.077"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 77: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were in the mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out to us  and said, &#8220;Let us proceed to the Jews.&#8221; So we went along with him till we  reached Bait-al-Midras (a place where the Torah used to be recited and all the Jews of the  town used to gather). The Prophet stood up and addressed them, &#8220;O Assembly of Jews!  Embrace Islam and you will be safe!&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;O Aba-l-Qasim! You have  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;That is what I want (from  you).&#8221; He repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, &#8220;You  have conveyed Allah&#8217;s message, O Aba-l-Qasim.&#8221; Then he said it for the third time and  added, &#8220;You should Know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want  to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns some property, can sell it,  otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 392, Vol. 4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 78: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khansa&#8217; bint Khidam Al-Ansariya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That her father gave her in marriage when she was a matron  and she disliked that marriage. So she came and (complained) to the Prophets and he  declared that marriage invalid. (See Hadith No. 69, Vol. 7) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.079"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 79: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Should the  women be asked for their consent to their marriage?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  said, &#8220;A virgin, if asked, feels shy and keeps quiet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her  silence means her consent.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.080"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 80: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man from the Ansar made his slave, a Mudabbar. And apart  from that slave he did not have any other property. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  he said, &#8220;Who will buy that slave from me?&#8221; So Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him  for 800 Dirham. Jabir added: It was a coptic (Egyptian) slave who died that year. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 81: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>wished, for they had more right to dispose of her than her  own relativ </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.082"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 82: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham migrated  with his wife Sarah till he reached a town where there was a king or a tyrant who sent a  message, to Abraham, ordering him to send Sarah to him. So when Abraham had sent Sarah,  the tyrant got up, intending to do evil with her, but she got up and performed ablution  and prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah ! If I have believed in You and in Your Apostle, then do not  empower this oppressor over me.&#8217; So he (the king) had an epileptic fit and started moving  his legs violently. &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.083"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 83: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of  another Muslim. So he should neither oppress him nor hand him over to an oppressor. And  whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.084"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 84: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother whether he is  an oppressor or an oppressed,&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will help him  if he is oppressed, but if he is an oppressor, how shall I help him?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing (others), for that is how to help him.&#8221;  </font></p>

Do you hope that (emigration)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on the leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Here is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his face covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must have brought you here at this hour.&#8221; The Prophet came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Let those who are with you, go out.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;(There is no stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8221; I shall accompany you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles!

And Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the &#8216;Isha prayer. They would sleep soundly till &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">For one year I wanted to ask &#8216;Umar about the two women who helped each other against the Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &#8220;(They were) &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &#8216;Strange! You can retort in this way?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives.&#8217; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah&#8217;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &#8216;A great event has happened!&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Greater than that! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, &#8220;Ask the permission for me to enter.&#8221; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;O people! The reward of deeds depends  upon the intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he has  intended. So, whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration was for  Allah and His Apostle, and whoever emigrated to take worldly benefit or for a woman to  marry, then his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  prayers.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to offer perfectly the five (compulsory)  prayers in a day and a night (24 hrs.), except if you want to perform some extra optional  prayers.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  fasting.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to observe fast during the month of  Ramadan except if you fast some extra optional fast.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me  what Allah has enjoined on me as regard Zakat.&#8221; The Prophet then told him the Islamic  laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, &#8220;By Him Who has honored you, I will  not perform any optional deeds of worship and I will not leave anything of what Allah has  enjoined on me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He will be successful if he has told the  truth (or he will enter Paradise if he said the truth).&#8221; And some people said,  &#8220;The Zakat for one-hundred and twenty camels is two Hiqqas, and if the Zakat payer  slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them as a present or plays some other trick  in order to avoid the Zakat, then there is no harm (in it) for him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 89: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the  Kanz (Treasure or wealth of which, Zakat has not been paid) of anyone of you will appear  in the shape of a huge bald headed poisonous male snake and its owner will run away from  it, but it will follow him and say, &#8216;I am your Kanz.'&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;By  Allah, that snake will keep on following him until he stretches out his hand and let the  snake swallow it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;If the owner of camels does not pay  their Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection those camels will come to him and will  strike his face with their hooves.&#8221; Some people said: Concerning a man who has  camels, and is afraid that Zakat will be due so he sells those camels for similar camels  or for sheep or cows or money one day before Zakat becomes due in order to avoid payment  of their Zakat cunningly! &#8220;He has not to pay anything.&#8221; The same scholar said,  &#8220;If one pays Zakat of his camels one day or one year prior to the end of the year (by  the end of which Zakat becomes due), his Zakat will be valid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada Al-Ansari sought the verdict of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle regarding a vow made by his mother who had died before fulfilling it. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Fulfill it on her behalf.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If the number  of camels reaches twenty, then their owner has to pay four sheep as Zakat; and if their  owner gives them as a gift or sells them in order to escape the payment of Zakat cunningly  before the completion of a year, then he is not to pay anything, and if he slaughters them  and then dies, then no Zakat is to be taken from his property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Nafi narrated to me that &#8216;Abdullah said that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade the Shighar. I asked Nafi&#8217;, &#8220;What is the Shighar?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;It is to marry the daughter of a man and marry one&#8217;s daughter to that man (at the  same time) without Mahr (in both cases); or to marry the sister of a man and marry one&#8217;s  own sister to that man without Mahr.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one, by a trick,  marries on the basis of Shighar, the marriage is valid but its condition is illegal.&#8221;  The same scholar said regarding Al-Mut&#8217;a, &#8220;The marriage is invalid and its condition  is illegal.&#8221; Some others said, &#8220;The Mut&#8217;a and the Shighar are permissible but  the condition is illegal.&#8221; </font></p>

So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they  treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning women..&#8217; (4.127) (The sub-narrator then mentioned the Hadith.) </font></p>

How will  she(the virgin) express her consent?&#8221; He said, &#8220;By keeping silent.&#8221; Some  people said, &#8220;If a virgin is not asked for her consent and she is not married, and  then a man, by playing a trick presents two false witnesses that he has married her with  her consent and the judge confirms his marriage as a true one, and the husband knows that  the witnesses were false ones, then there is no harm for him to consummate his marriage  with her and the marriage is regarded as valid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A lady slave should not be  given in marriage until she is consulted, and a virgin should not be given in marriage  until her permission is granted.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;How will she express her  permission?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By keeping silent (when asked her  consent).&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man, by playing a trick, presents two false  witnesses before the judge to testify that he has married a matron with her consent and  the judge confirms his marriage, and the husband is sure that he has never married her  (before), then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and he may live with her  as husband.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is essential to have the  consent of a virgin (for the marriage). I said, &#8220;A virgin feels shy.&#8221; The  Prophet; said, &#8220;Her silence means her consent.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man  falls in love with an orphan slave girl or a virgin and she refuses (him) and then he  makes a trick by bringing two false witnesses to testify that he has married her, and then  she attains the age of puberty and agrees to marry him and the judge accepts the false  witness and the husband knows that the witnesses were false ones, he may consummate his  marriage.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 102: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to like sweets and also used to like  honey, and whenever he finished the &#8216;Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with  them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay,  so I enquired about it. It was said to me, &#8220;A woman from her tribe gave her a leather  skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  drink.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, we will play a trick on him.&#8221; So I mentioned the  story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to her, &#8220;When he enters upon you,  he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you  eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then you say to him, &#8216;What is this bad smell? &#8216; And it  would be very hard on Allah&#8217;s Apostle that a bad smell should be found on his body. He  will say, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; Then you should say to him, &#8216;Its bees  must have sucked from the Al-&#8216;Urfut (a foul smelling flower).&#8217; I too, will tell him the  same. And you, O Saifya, say the same.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So when the Prophet entered upon Sauda (the following  happened). Sauda said, &#8220;By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was  about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of  fear from you. But when Allah &#8216;s Apostle came near to me, I said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What about this smell?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Its bees must have sucked  Al-&#8216;Urfut.&#8217; &#8221; When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he  entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said  to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;I have no desire for it.&#8221; Sauda said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived him of it  (honey).&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab left for Sham, and when he reached a  placed called Sargh, he came to know that there was an outbreak of an epidemic (of plague)  in Sham. Then &#8216;AbdurRahman bin &#8216;Auf told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If you hear  the news of an outbreak of an epidemic (plague) in a certain place, do not enter that  place: and if the epidemic falls in a place while you are present in it, do not leave that  place to escape from the epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar returned from Sargh. </font></p>

So whoever hears that there is an outbreak of plague in some land, he should not go to  that land, and if the plague breaks out in the land where one is already present, one  should not run away from that land, escaping from the plague.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet has decreed that preemption is valid in all  cases where the real estate concerned has not been divided, but if the boundaries are  established and the ways are made, then there is no preemption. A man said,  &#8220;Preemption is only for the neighbor,&#8221; and then he makes invalid what he has  confirmed. He said, &#8220;If someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the  neighbor (of the house) may buy it through preemption, he buys one share out of one  hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can  only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house;  and the buyer may play such a trick in this case.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Miswar bin Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder  and I accompanied him to Sa&#8217;d. Abu Rafi&#8217; said to Al-Miswar, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you order this  (i.e. Sa&#8217;d) to buy my house which is in my yard?&#8221; Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;I will not offer  more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period.&#8221; Abu Rafi said, &#8220;I  was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;A  neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,&#8217; I would not have sold it  to you.&#8221; The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma&#8217;mar did not say so. Sufyan said, &#8220;But  he did say so to me.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If someone wants to sell a house and  deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render  the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and  marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand  Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Ash-Sharid: Abu Rafi&#8217; said that Sa&#8217;d  offered him four hundred Mithqal of gold for a house. Abu Rafi &#8216; said, &#8220;If I had not  heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his  neighbor,&#8217; then I would not have given it to you.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one has  bought a portion of a house and wants to cancel the right of preemption, he may give it as  a present to his little son and he will not be obliged to take an oath.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 108: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to  collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim&#8217;s tribe. When he returned, the Prophet called him to  account. He said (to the Prophet, &#8216;This is your money, and this has been given to me as a  gift.&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay in your father&#8217;s and  mother&#8217;s house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the  truth?&#8221; Then the Prophet addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he  said: &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du&#8221;, I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what  Allah has put under my custody, and then he comes to me and says, &#8216;This is your money and  this has been given to me as a gift. Why didn&#8217;t he stay in his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s home  to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Allah, not anyone of you takes a thing  unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do  not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep  on meeting Allah.&#8221; Then the Prophet raised both his hands till the whiteness of his  armpits became visible, and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Haven&#8217;t I have conveyed (Your  Message)?&#8221; The narrator added: My eyes witnessed and my ears heard (that Hadith). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Rafi&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The neighbor has more right to be  taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else).&#8221; Some men said, &#8220;If one wants  to buy a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive  somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 20,000 Dirhams but paying to the  seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in  cash for the rest of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000  Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy it (by this trick he  got out of preemption). If the house proves to belong to somebody else other than the  seller, the buyer should take back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams  and one Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the whole  bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the house and it does not  belong to somebody other than the seller, the buyer may return it and receive 20,000  Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.&#8217; Abu &#8216;Abdullah  said, &#8220;So that man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims  (although) the Prophet said, &#8216;In dealing with Muslims one should not sell them sick  (animals) or bad things or stolen things.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.073.001"></a>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Walid bin &#8216;Aizar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abi Amr &#8216;Ash-Shaibani saying, &#8220;The owner of this house.&#8221; he pointed to &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s house, &#8220;said, &#8216;I asked the Prophet &#8216;Which deed is loved most by Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To offer prayers at their early (very first) stated times.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had asked more, he would have told me more.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet, &#8220;Shall I participate in Jihad?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are your parents living?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; the Prophet said, &#8220;Do Jihad for their benefit.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&#8221; It was asked (by the people), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How does a man curse his parents?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While three persons were traveling, they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it. They said to each other. &#8216;Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn&#8217;t return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.&#8217; So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, &#8216;O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said &#8216;O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.&#8217; I said (to him). &#8216;Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.&#8217; And so Allah released them (from their difficulty).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden you ( 1 ) to be undutiful to your mothers (2) to withhold (what you should give) or (3) demand (what you do not deserve), and (4) to bury your daughters alive. And Allah has disliked that (A) you talk too much about others ( B), ask too many questions (in religion), or (C) waste your property.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said thrice, &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the great sins?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221; He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah: to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet sat up after he had been reclining and added, &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness; I warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying that warning till we thought that he would not stop.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the greatest sins or he was asked about the greatest sins. He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to kill a soul which Allah has forbidden to kill; and to be undutiful or unkind to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Shall I inform you of the biggest of the great sins? That is the forged statement or the false witness.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba (the sub-narrator) states that most probably the Prophet said, &#8220;the false witness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother came to me, hoping (for my favor) during the lifetime of the Prophet asked the Prophet, &#8220;May I treat her kindly?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Uyaina said, &#8220;Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Allah forbids you not with regards to those who fought not against you because of religion, and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them.&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;.(60.8)</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sufyan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Heraclius sent for him and said, &#8220;What did he, i.e. the Prophet order you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He orders us to offer prayers; to give alms; to be chaste; and to keep good relations with our relatives.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet), &#8220;How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (&#8216;Umar&#8217;s brother) embraced Islam.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Inform me of a deed which will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He has something to ask (what he needs greatly).&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and join none in worship with Him: You should offer prayers perfectly, give obligatory charity (Zakat), and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Leave it!&#8221; (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;It seems that the Prophet was riding his she camel.&#8221;</p>

Allah said, &#8216;Yes, won&#8217;t you be pleased that I will keep good relations with the one who will keep good relations with you, and I will sever the relation with the one who will sever the relations with you.&#8217; It said, &#8216;Yes, O my Lord.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Then that is for you &#8216; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added. &#8220;Read (in the Qur&#8217;an) if you wish, the Statement of Allah: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?&#8217; (47.22)</p>

So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.&#8221;</p>

He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has it been shortened.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Surely, you have forgotten, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, Dhul-Yadain has told the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet got up and offered other two Rakat and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then he said Takbir, performed a prostration of ordinary duration or longer, then he raised his head and said Takbir and performed another prostration of ordinary duration or longer and then raised his head and said Takbir (i.e. he performed the two prostrations of Sahu, i.e., forgetfulness).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) that she was told that &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (on hearing that she was selling or giving something as a gift) said, &#8220;By Allah, if &#8216;Aisha does not give up this, I will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) say so?&#8221; They (people) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I vow to Allah that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubair.&#8221; When this desertion lasted long, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow.&#8221; When this state of affairs was prolonged on Ibn Az-Zubair (he felt it hard on him), he said to Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth, who were from the tribe of Bani Zahra, &#8220;I beseech you, by Allah, to let me enter upon &#8216;Aisha, for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me.&#8221; So Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, wrapping their sheets around themselves, asked &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s permission saying, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be upon you! Shall we come in?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221; They said, &#8220;All of us?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, come in all of you,&#8221; not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of &#8216;Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), &#8220;The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days).&#8221; So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others&#8217; sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, &#8220;I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.&#8221; They (Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about &#8220;Al-Luqata&#8221; (a lost fallen purse or a thing picked up by somebody). The Prophet said, &#8220;You should announce it publicly for one year, and then remember and recognize the tying material of its container, and then you can spend it. If its owner came to you, then you should pay him its equivalent.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Take it because it is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle became very angry and furious and his cheeks became red (or his face became red), and he said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it (the camel) for it has its food and its water container with it till it meets its owner.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a small room (with a palm leaf mat). Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out (of his house) and prayed in it. Some men came and joined him in his prayer. Then again the next night they came for the prayer, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle delayed and did not come out to them. So they raised their voices and knocked the door with small stones (to draw his attention). He came out to them in a state of anger, saying, &#8220;You are still insisting (on your deed, i.e. Tarawih prayer in the mosque) that I thought that this prayer (Tarawih) might become obligatory on you. So you people, offer this prayer at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is the one which he offers at home, except the compulsory (congregational) prayer.&#8221;</p>

Only if he said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast.&#8217; &#8221; So they said to that (furious) man, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you hear what the Prophet is saying?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not mad.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But when he entered, the Prophet spoke to him gently in a polite manner. I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.&#8221; I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction.

So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, &#8220;What have you done (about the guests)?&#8221; They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet.

I beseech you by Allah, if you hear my voice, then come out!&#8221; I came out and said, &#8220;Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me).&#8221; They said, &#8220;He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As you have been waiting for me, by Allah, I will not eat of it tonight.&#8221; They said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not eat of it till you eat of it.&#8221; He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don&#8217;t you accept your meals of hospitality from us?&#8221; (He said to me), &#8220;Bring your meal.&#8221; I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, &#8220;In the name of Allah.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;All that happened was from Satan.&#8221; So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), &#8220;O, sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8221; She said, &#8220;O, pleasure of my eyes! The meal is now more than it had been before we started eating&#8221; So they ate of it and sent the rest of that meal to the Prophet.

The Prophet said, &#8220;Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,&#8221; (or said, &#8220;..your companion&#8221;). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The murder was a thing we did not witness.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree&#8221; When I came out with my father, I said, &#8220;O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What prevented you from saying it?&#8221; Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most true words said by a poet were the words of Labid. He said, i.e. &#8216;Verily, everything except Allah is perishable and Umaiya bin Abi As-Salt was about to embrace Islam &#8216;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar and we travelled during the night. A man amongst the people said to &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel&#8217;s foot steps, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is that driver (of the camels)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa.&#8221;&#8216; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His mercy on him.&#8221; A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are those fires? For what are you making fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking meat.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Donkeys&#8217; meat.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots.&#8221; A man said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You can do that too.&#8221; When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit &#8216;Amir&#8217;s knee and caused him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw me pale and said, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who said so?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, &#8216;Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, &#8216;Amir will have double reward.&#8221;&#8216; (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, &#8220;He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah&#8217;s Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an &#8220;Arab like him.&#8221;</p>

Who else would act justly if I did not act justly?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop his neck off.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, for he has companions (who are apparently so pious that) if anyone of (you compares his prayer with) their prayer, he will consider his prayer inferior to theirs, and similarly his fasting inferior to theirs, but they will desert Islam (go out of religion) as an arrow goes through the victim&#8217;s body (games etc.) in which case if its Nasl is examined nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Nady is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Qudhadh is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, for the arrow has gone out too fast even for the excretions and blood to smear over it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! Didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;Abdullah bin Unbar). &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &#8216;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you&#8230;..and from the pagans (3.186)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8216;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. &#8230;. (2.109) So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&#8217;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&#8221;. Then they became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(One night) the Prophet woke up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah ! How many treasures have been (disclosed) sent down! And how many afflictions have been descended! Who will go and wake the sleeping lady-occupants up of these dwellings (for praying)?&#8221; (He meant by this his wives.) The Prophet added, &#8220;A well-dressed soul (person) in this world may be naked in the &#8220;Hereafter.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet, &#8216;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safiya bint Huyai:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wife of the Prophet that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in Itikaf (staying in the mosque) during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. She spoke to him for an hour (a while) at night and then she got up to return home. The Prophet got up to accompany her, and when they reached the gate of the mosque opposite the dwelling place of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by, and greeting Allah&#8217;s Apostle , they quickly went ahead. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;Do not be in a hurry She is Safiya, the daughter of Huyai.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (how dare we suspect you).&#8221; That was a great thing for both of them. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Satan runs in the body of Adam&#8217;s son (i.e. man) as his blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that he (Satan) might insert an evil thought in your hearts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mughaffal Al-Muzani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forbade the throwing of stones (with the thumb and the index or middle finger), and said &#8220;It neither hunts a game nor kills (or hurts) an enemy, but it gouges out an eye or breaks a tooth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet. The Prophet said to one of them, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on you,&#8221; but he did not say that to the other. On being asked (why), the Prophet said, &#8220;That one praised Allah (at the time of sneezing), while the other did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ordered us to do seven (things) and forbade us from seven (other things): He ordered us to pay a visit to the sick, to follow funeral possessions, to say: May Allah be merciful to you to a sneezer, &#8211; if he says: Praise be to Allah, to accept invitation (invitation to a wedding banquet), to return greetings, to help the oppressed, and to help others to fulfill their oaths (provided it was not sinful). And he forbade us from seven (things): to wear golden rings or golden bangles, to wear silk (cloth), Dibaj, Sundus and Mayathir.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning, so if someone sneezes and then praises Allah, then it is obligatory on every Muslim who heard him, to say: May Allah be merciful to you (Yar-hamuka-l-lah). But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so one must try one&#8217;s best to stop it, if one says &#8216;Ha&#8217; when yawning, Satan will laugh at him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8221; If anyone of you sneezes, he should say &#8216;Al-Hamdulillah&#8217; (Praise be to Allah), and his (Muslim) brother or companion should say to him, &#8216;Yar-hamuka-l-lah&#8217; (May Allah bestow his Mercy on you). When the latter says &#8216;Yar-hamuka-llah&#8221;, the former should say, &#8216;Yahdikumul-lah wa Yuslih balakum&#8217; (May Allah give you guidance and improve your condition).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet and he said Tashmit to one of them, while he did not say Tashmit to the other. So that man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said Tashmit to that fellow but you did not say Tashmit to me. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;That man praised Allah, but you did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning; so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him. But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so if one of you yawns, he should try his best to stop it, for when anyone of you yawns, Satan laughs at him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.088.172"></a>Volume 9, Book 88, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me whereupon I will say, &#8216;My followers!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You do not know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'&#8221; (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, &#8220;Allah, we seek refuge with You from turning on our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial&#8221;).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 173:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar) and some men amongst you will be brought to me, and when I will try to hand them some water, they will be pulled away from me by force whereupon I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my companions!&#8217; Then the Almighty will say, &#8216;You do not know what they did after you left, they introduced new things into the religion after you.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 174:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar), and whoever will come to it, will drink from it, and whoever will drink from it, will never become thirsty after that. There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: &#8220;I will say those people are from me. It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.&#8217; Then I will say, &#8216;Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me! &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 175:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;You will see after me, selfishness (on the part of other people) and other matters that you will disapprove of.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What do you order us to do, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? (under such circumstances)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Pay their rights to them (to the rulers) and ask your right from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 176:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever disapproves of something done by his ruler then he should be patient, for whoever disobeys the ruler even a little (little = a span) will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. (i.e. as rebellious Sinners).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 177:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever notices something which he dislikes done by his ruler, then he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from the company of the Muslims even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance (as rebellious sinners). (Fateh-Al-Bari page 112, Vol. 16)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Junada bin Abi Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We entered upon &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit while he was sick. We said, &#8220;May Allah make you healthy. Will you tell us a Hadith you heard from the Prophet and by which Allah may make you benefit?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet called us and we gave him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam, and among the conditions on which he took the Pledge from us, was that we were to listen and obey (the orders) both at the time when we were active and at the time when we were tired, and at our difficult time and at our ease and to be obedient to the ruler and give him his right even if he did not give us our right, and not to fight against him unless we noticed him having open Kufr (disbelief) for which we would have a proof with us from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 179:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usaid bin Hudair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You appointed such-and-such person and you did not appoint me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;After me you will see rulers not giving you your right (but you should give them their right) and be patient till you meet me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 180:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the truthful and trusted by Allah (i.e., the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;The destruction of my followers will be through the hands of young men from Quraish.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet got up from his sleep with a flushed red face and said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil that is nearly approaching them. Today a gap has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this.&#8221; (Sufyan illustrated by this forming the number 90 or 100 with his fingers.) It was asked, &#8220;Shall we be destroyed though there are righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if evil increased.&#8221;</p>

Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) Town (Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, your properties, your honors and your skins (i.e., bodies) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness (for it).

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will be its taint?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8221; I said, &#8220;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met &#8216;Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).&#8217; (4.97)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 208:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&#8217;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&#8217;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &#8220;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&#8217;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &#8216;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&#8217; and later it will be said about some man, &#8216;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&#8217; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</p>

You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins.&#8221; Salama replied, &#8220;No, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert.&#8221; Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: When &#8216;Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.</p>

So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.&#8221; I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,&#8221; Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe!

Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! And also on our Najd.&#8221; I think the third time the Prophet said, &#8220;There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221;</p>

But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'&#8221; (2.193) Ibn &#8216;Umar said (to the man), &#8220;Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &#8220;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&#8221; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &#8216;Umar came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &#8216;Uthman came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get permission for you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &#8216;Uthman is separate from theirs.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone said to Usama, &#8220;Will you not talk to this (Uthman)?&#8221; Usama said, &#8220;I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn&#8217;t you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?&#8217; That man will say, &#8216;I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the battle of Al-Jamal, Allah benefited me with a Word (I heard from the Prophet).

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Talha, AzZubair and &#8216;Aisha moved to Basra, &#8216;Ali sent &#8216;Ammar bin Yasir and Hasan bin &#8216;Ali who came to us at Kufa and ascended the pulpit. Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was at the top of the pulpit and &#8216;Ammar was below Al-Hasan. We all gathered before him. I heard &#8216;Ammar saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha has moved to Al-Busra. By Allah! She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter. But Allah has put you to test whether you obey Him (Allah) or her (&#8216;Aisha).&#8221;</p>

They said to him, &#8220;Since you have become a Muslim, we have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to us than your haste in this matter.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Since you (both) became Muslims, I have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to me than your keeping away from this matter.&#8221; Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud provided &#8216;Ammar and Abu Musa with two-piece outfits to wear, and one of them went to the mosque (of Kufa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sitting with Abu Mas&#8217;ud and Abu Musa and &#8216;Ammar. Abu Mas&#8217;ud said (to &#8216;Ammar), &#8220;There is none of your companions but, if I wish, I could find fault with him except with you. Since you joined the company of the Prophet I have never seen anything done by you more criticizable by me than your haste in this issue.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, O Abu Mas&#8217;ud ! I have never seen anything done by you or by this companion of yours (i.e., Abu Musa) more criticizable by me than your keeping away from this issue since the time you both joined the company of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud who was a rich man, said (to his servant), &#8220;O boy! Bring two suits.&#8221; Then he gave one to Abu Musa and the other to &#8216;Ammar and said (to them), &#8220;Put on these suits before going for the Friday prayer. &#8220;</p>

On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, &#8220;Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, &#8220;Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Hasan (bin &#8216;Ali) came and the Prophet said, &#8216;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra&#8217; (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, &#8220;O Abu Barza! Don&#8217;t you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?&#8221; The first thing heard him saying &#8220;I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Soon the river &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;raj narrated from Abii Huraira that the Prophet said the same but he said, &#8220;It (Euphrates) will uncover a mountain of gold (under it).&#8221;</p>

So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) &#8216;No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.&#8217; (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Nobody asked the Prophet as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal.

I asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;The son of Mary.&#8217; Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware!

He will say &#8216;I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story Allah&#8217;s Apostle has told us.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), &#8216;Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;No,&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam in his complete  shape and form (directly), sixty cubits (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him,  He said (to him), &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what  they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your  offspring.&#8221; Adam (went and) said, &#8216;As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon you).&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;AsSalamu-&#8216;Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you) So they  increased &#8216;Wa Rahmatullah&#8217; The Prophet added &#8216;So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of  the shape and form of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam&#8217;s (offspring) (i.e. stature of  human beings is being diminished continuously) to the present time.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Fadl bin &#8216;Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion  rider on the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice,  10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;Beware! Avoid sitting on the  roads.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! We can&#8217;t help sitting (on  the roads) as these are (our places) here we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216; l f you  refuse but to sit, then pay the road its right &#8216; They said, &#8220;What is the right of the  road, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8216;Lowering your gaze, refraining from harming  others, returning greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet  emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah&#8217;s Apostle for ten years (the last part of  his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of  Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. It was  revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with Zainab bint  Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone. At that time the Divine  Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his  family). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 74, Number 256: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet married Zainab, the people came and were  offered a meal, and then they sat down (after finishing their meals) and started chatting.  The Prophet showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed  that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept  on sitting. When the Prophet returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but  then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet of their departure and he came and went  in. I intended to go in but the Prophet put a screen between me and him, for Allah  revealed:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses..&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Let your wives be veiled&#8221; But he did not do so. The wives of  the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.&#8217; Once  Sauda, the daughter of Zam&#8217;a went out and she was a tall woman. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw  her while he was in a gathering, and said, &#8220;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&#8221; He  (&#8216;Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling  of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover  excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man peeped through a round hole into the dwelling place  of the Prophet, while the Prophet had a Midray (an iron comb) with which he was scratching  his head. the Prophet said, &#8221; Had known you were looking (through the hole), I would  have pierced your eye with it (i.e., the comb).&#8221; Verily! The order of taking  permission to enter has been enjoined because of that sight, (that one should not look  unlawfully at the state of others). (See Hadith No. 807, Vol. 7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have not seen a thing resembling &#8216;lamam&#8217; (minor sins)  than what Abu Huraira &#8216;narrated from the Prophet who said &#8220;Allah has written for  Adam&#8217;s son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is  the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the  inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was present in one of the gatherings of the Ansar,  Abu Musa came as if he was scared, and said, &#8220;I asked permission to enter upon &#8216;Umar  three times, but I was not given the permission, so I returned.&#8221; (When &#8216;Umar came to  know about it) he said to Abu Musa, &#8220;Why did you not enter?&#8217;. Abu Musa replied,  &#8220;I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the  permission is not given, then he should return.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah! We  will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it.&#8221; (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the  Ansar and said). &#8220;Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet ?&#8221; Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  said, &#8220;By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a  witness).&#8221; (Abu Said) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed  &#8216;Umar that the Prophet had said so.

She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it  in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the  Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present  us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a  midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 60, Vol.2) </font></p>

The Prophet said,  &#8220;When you stand for prayer, perform ablution properly and then face the Qibla and say  Takbir (Allahu-Akbar), and then recite what you know from the Qur&#8217;an, and then bow with  calmness till you feel at ease then rise from bowing, till you stand straight, and then  prostrate calmly (and remain in prostration) till you feel at ease, and then raise (your  head) and sit with calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness (and  remain in prostration) till you feel at ease, and then raise (your head) and sit with  calmness till you feel at ease in the sitting position, and do likewise in whole of your  prayer.&#8221; And Abu Usama added, &#8220;Till you stand straight.&#8221; (See Hadith No.  759, Vol.1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa-bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said, &#8220;The Prophet rode over a donkey  with a saddle underneath which there was a thick soft Fadakiya velvet sheet. Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips to  return to my greetings or not till fifty nights passed away. The Prophet then announced  (to the people) Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for us (acceptance of our repentance) at the time when  he had offered the Fajr (morning) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu  Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, &#8220;Proceed till you reach  Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin  Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca).&#8221; So we overtook her while she was proceeding on  her camel at the same place as Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us. We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was walking with the Prophet at the Hurra of Medina  in the evening, the mountain of Uhud appeared before us. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu  Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he invited  the people who took their meals and then remained sitting and talking. The Prophet  pretended to be ready to get up, but the people did not get up. When he noticed that, he  got up, and when he had got up, some of those people got up along with him and there  remained three (who kept on sitting). Then the Prophet came back and found those people  still sitting. Later on those people got up and went away. So I went to the Prophet and  informed him that they had left. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came, and entered (his house). I wanted to  enter(along with him) but he dropped a curtain between me and him. Allah then revealed: &#8216;O  you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet&#8217;s Houses until leave is given&#8230; (to His  statement)&#8230; Verily! That shall be an enormity, in Allah&#8217;s sight.&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

And isn&#8217;t there among you the person whom Allah gave refuge from  Satan through the request (tongue) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle? (i.e., &#8216;Ammar).

So he  asked &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;There was something (a quarrel)  between me and him whereupon he got angry with me and went out without having a midday nap  in my house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked a person to look for him. That person came, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went there and found him lying. His upper body cover had fallen off to one side of  his body, and so he was covered with dust. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started cleaning the dust from  him, saying, &#8220;Get up, O Abu Turab! Get up, Abu Turab!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 432, Vol  1) </font></p>
