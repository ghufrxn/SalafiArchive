<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 56: Point 98 (Start of Volume 2)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the scholars did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the lowly and despicable folk  (<em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah)</em> spoke concerning public affairs. And they spoke against the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared those who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/jahmiyyah-and-ruwaybidah-the-lowly-despicable-folk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and by al-Bazzaar in his <em>Musnad</em> and by at-Ta<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Anas that he said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 98</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the rights of the Ansaar and the advice given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> concerning them and the family of the Messenger. Do not abuse them, acknowledge their virtue and their deeds of excellence. And acknowledge the virtue of his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/acknowledge-the-virtue-of-the-ansaar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And acknowledge the virtue of the Ansaar,” </strong></span>from the tribes of the Aws and the Khazraj and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the most excellent of the generations. They are the most excellent of the generations because of his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because Allaah chose them to be companions of his Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they gave the <em>Bay`ah</em> (pledge) to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they fought Jihaad along with him and they carried the knowledge from him and conveyed it to mankind. So the sahaabah (companions) are the most excellent of the generations and no-one can catch them with respect to their virtue. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the One in whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend in charity the like of Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach the handsful of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; if a person were to spend in charity with the like of the mountain of U<u>h</u>ud, it would not equal a handsful of barley, which was given by a companion. So this shows the virtue of the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>. So this is tremendous virtue, which must be acknowledged for them <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and from the Ansaar and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens in Paradise beneath which rivers flow.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree. So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquility upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating seeking bounty from Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign is upon their faces from the traces of prostration. That is their description in the Towraah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description in the Towraat.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And their description in the Injeel is that of a plant which sends out side-shoots, which support it so that it becomes firm and strong, upright upon its stalk; it pleases those who have planted it so that the disbelievers may become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These <em>aayahs</em> are with regard to the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>, which shows their virtue and their status with Allaah and with His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they have different levels of excellence amongst themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the four <em>Khulafaa`</em> (Caliphs); they are the most excellent ones from the companions, then the rest of the ten who are promised Paradise then, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> because Allaah mentioned them first ahead of the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and because they (the <em>Muhaajireen</em>) left their homes and their wealth and their homelands for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and they migrated in Allaah’s cause. So they have excellence over the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. Then the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> because they sheltered the Messenger and they gave shelter to the Muslims and supported them and they assisted them with their wealth and they lived in harmony along with them and they loved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who were present at Badr also, they have virtue and specific excellence and those who were present at the pledge of <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan; Bay`atur-ri<u>d</u>waan.</em> He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then those who accepted Islaam before the Conquest are more excellent than those who accepted Islaam after the Conquest of Makkah. So they have different degrees of virtue amongst them. However, overall they are more excellent than others besides them from all generations until the Hour is established. No-one can match them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the council given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to them,”</strong></span> meaning: the strong advice given by the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one will love the An<u>s</u>aar except for a believer and<br />
no-one will hate them except for a hypocrite (munaafiq).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.” </strong></span>Meaning, the person who lives in Al-Madinah and has patience with it, hoping for reward and he has patience upon its hardships, hoping for reward and is constant upon prayer in the mosque of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he will have reward for that. There is no doubt about it but as for the person who lives therein and he commits evil and he commits shirk along with Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and he propagates innovations then his punishment will be multiplied for he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever commits innovations in it or who gives shelter to an innovator then upon him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all of mankind.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Briefly with regard to the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said with regard to the point; <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.”</span> </strong>What is meant by the neighbours here are those people who are not from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (<em>Aws and the Khazraj</em>) nor were they from Quraysh but they were Muslims so they have the right of Islaam and they have virtue for their having patience upon the difficulties in Al-Madinah. So it is obligatory to acknowledge the virtue of the people of virtue and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 97</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim due to their kinship to Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs and of the branches of the tribes. Acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam. And the freed slave who belonged to a people is one of them. And acknowledge the rights of the rest of the people in Islaam.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim)</span></strong>,<strong>” </strong>the Banu Haashim; clan of Haashim ibn `Abd Manaaf (the son of `Abd Manaaf) because `Abd Manaaf had a number of sons and they were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1)Haashim who is the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and (2)`Abdu-Shams who is the grandfather of `Uthmaan ibn Affaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (3) Nawfal ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (4) al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of Banu Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all the sons of `Abd Manaaf. And the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was raised amongst the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim), the son of `Abd Manaaf; so he was a Haashimee Qurayshee (larger tribe of Quraysh from the clan of Haashim; children of Haashim). And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah chose Kinaanah from the descendants of Ismaa’eel and he chose from Kinaanah, the Quraysh and he chose from the Quraysh, Banu Haashim and he chose me from the Banu Haashim.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; the believers from Banu Haashim. They are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) who have the right upon the Muslims. It is forbidden for them to accept charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> but it is permissible for them to accept a gift (<em>hadiyyah)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than the believers then they have no worth even if they are from Banu Haashim. Rather, it is only when <em>qaraabah</em> (close kinship) comes along with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then in that case, there is no doubt that they have distinction over other people and they have the right that they be shown honour and respect and they have the right to be respected and given precedence since this is a part of the respect of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, if they are not believers (<em>mu&#8217;mineen)</em> then all that is the case is that they are from Banu Haashim and they are disbelievers so there is no honour for them. And the same goes to everyone who ascribes themselves to the Banu Haashim who is not upon the way of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> and not upright then he has no worth. So, it is not just being merely closely related on its own that brings about the right. Rather, it is kinship along with having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting my close relatives (qurbaa).</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in one saying. And Allaah appointed for them a share of the <em>khumus</em> (fifth part of booty). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you should know that whatever you take as booty then one fifth of it is assigned for Allaah, the Messenger and the close relatives of the Messenger.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>Th</u></em><em>il-Qurbaa</em>-The close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs,” </strong></span>after the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim) is the virtue of the Muslims from the Quraysh. They have excellence over the rest of the Arabs; then the Arabs have excellence over the `<em>ajam (</em>non-Arabs). Why? Because Allaah sent down the Qur&#8217;aan in their language and He sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from them and He chose them to convey His message and therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High, said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِي أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<em>In an address to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So hold fast to this Qur&#8217;aan that has been sent down to you. Indeed you are upon a straight and true path and it will be an honour for you. </strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>43-44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the Qur·aan will be an honour for you and for your people; meaning the Arabs and you shall soon be questioned concerning it. You people will soon be questioned about the implementation of this Qur·aan and about the call to it and about having conveyed it, because Allaah gave them the duty of bearing it and conveying it to the rest of the world. So this is the aspect for which the Arabs have superiority. They were not given excellence just because they were Arabs alone; rather, they were given superiority on account of what they are specified with by Allaah with regard to the Qur·aan and the Sunnah and the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they carry out the duty of conveying this religion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation that has been brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let there be from amongst you a group who call the people to the good and they command the good and they forbid the evil and they are the ones who will be successful.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the aspect in which the Arabs have specific excellence. When they adhere to this religion and they convey it, then they have virtue over others. As for those who do not adhere to this religion then he has no excellence because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! We have created you all from a single male and female and we made from you nations and tribes so that you should become acquainted with each other. Indeed the most honourable of you with Allaah are those who have the most <em>taqwaa</em> (the most dutiful to Allaah).</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab nor for a white person over a black person except on account of taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah). All of you are from Aadam and Aadam was from earth.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the angle from which the Arabs have superiority. If they establish the duty that Allaah has given to them to propagate this religion and to call to it and to explain it to mankind then they will be more excellent than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and likewise all the branches of the tribes,” </strong></span><em>Al-Afkhaa<u>th</u></em> means a subsection of the tribes. So first there is the tribe meaning the large unit of the tribe then there are the <em>Afkhaa<u>th</u></em>; branches of the tribe so it is a part of the tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam.”</span> </strong>Each one in accordance with his own virtue and right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the freed slave who belonged to a people is from them&#8221;</span>. </strong>This is a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Meaning <em>al-`ateeq</em>; meaning a slave who has been set free. So a person who has been set free by the Haashimiyyeen (clan of Haashim), he will have the ruling of being from the clan of Haashim; or somebody who was a slave who had been set free by anybody else, he will have the same ruling as them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,276) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to this narration, they don’t mention any reference here in the footnotes but Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this narration occurs in the explanation of At-<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned in his notes, note no. 461 that this narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> and that it occurs in the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad especially the first part of the narration and the latter part you can find it also in the <em>Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and in the <em>Musnad</em> of Al-Bazdaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy <u>(</u>6761) from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The slave set free by a people is from them themselves.”</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said starting off with the point with regard to Banu Haashim he said, “I say Banu Haashim (the clan of Haashim), they have virtue on account of their being close relatives of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, said to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my kinsfolk</span>. </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my close relatives.” </strong></span>Meaning that that is not counted as taking reward but rather that the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sought from the nation that they should recognise the rights of his kinsfolk and respect them from their respect for him and that they should show honour to them as a part of their showing honour to him for indeed a Muslim has rights upon the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then a Muslim who is from the Banu Haashim who clings to his religion will have the right of Islaam and he will have the right that is due to a close relative of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and likewise the rest of the branches of the Quraysh except that Allaah has not put the duty upon us to love those who are not upon the correct `<em>aqeedah</em> and who are not upright upon Islaam. And indeed the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> freed himself from those who are contrary to his way. So he <em><u>s</u>alawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed the people of the father; meaning so and so, they are not my awliyaa </strong>(friends and allies)<strong>. Rather my guardian Lord is Allaah and my allies are the righteous believers.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhaariyy.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the rest of the branches,” </strong></span>meaning, the rest of the branches of the Quraysh and the tribes of the Arabs. Their rights in Islaam should be recognised and Allaah grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <u>H</u>adeeth for that reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,406) from Sabrah al-Juhanee that, He was with Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O people, I have permitted you to take pleasure from the women and Allaah has forbidden that now until the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever has something from them then let that go on its way and do not take from anything that you have given to them.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded us with <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage) in the year of the conquest when we entered Makkah then we did not depart from it until he had forbidden us from it.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 90D &amp; 90E</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90D)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And they called to sectarianism (<em>furqah)</em> and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade sectarianism. Some of them declared others to be disbelievers. And everyone called to his own opinion and to calling those who disagreed with him disbelievers. So the ignorant people, the rabble and those having no knowledge went astray. They caused the people to become greedy for the things of this life and to fear worldly punishment. So the people followed them upon fear regarding their religion and out of hope for what they possessed from this world</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they called to sectarianism and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden sectarianism.”</span> </strong>Allaah has forbidden sectarianism, splitting; <em>al-furqah</em>. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be like those who split up and differed after the clear signs had come to them.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 105)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who were given the scripture did not differ except after the clear truth had come to them.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Bayyinah (98), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they differed and split not upon ignorance but rather upon knowledge; `<em>ilm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And some of them declared others to be disbelievers,” </strong></span>The <em>firaq</em> (sects) started declaring each other to be disbelievers. And this is a sign which is manifest upon them. And this is a proof that they are all upon falsehood. As for the people of the truth and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> then they do not declare each other to be disbelievers. Rather, they are friends and allies to each other, they love each other and they support each other and they advise each other. And likewise, they do not declare the other sects to be disbelievers except for what the Book and the Sunnah proves to be disbelief. Otherwise, it is the case that they (the people of sunnah) are justly balanced with regard to the matter of <em>Takfeer</em>. They do not declare anyone a disbeliever except for those whom the proof is established that he is a disbeliever and they are not hasty with regard to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and each one called to his own opinion and to declaring those who disagreed with him to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>This is a sign of the people of misguidance. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا ۖ كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they split into parties and sects, each one following a separate book, every group rejoicing in what it was upon.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Zuburan</em>; meaning books. They authored books and this occurs. They author books to support their own position and their own party and they rejoice in what they are upon. And if they had just been upon ignorance then it could be hoped that they would return. However, they rejoice in what they are upon from falsehood and they believe it to be the truth. And this is a punishment from Allaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So the ignorant people and the <em>ra`aa`</em> (the common rabble) and those who had no knowledge went astray.”</span> </strong>They led the ignorant people astray and the rubble and those who had no knowledge. But as for the people of the truth and the people of knowledge then they are not affected by these sects and these misguidances because they know that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they caused the people to become greedy for things of this world and they cause them to fear the punishment of this world.” </strong></span>That is from the means which they utilise in their trial that they give their followers some of the things, which they crave after.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the creation followed them therefore, upon fear with regard to their religion and upon hope with regard to what they had of this world.” </strong></span>Many of the people have love of this world so therefore, they will follow anyone who will give them anything from wealth even if he is upon falsehood as a result of their craving for wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Point Continues </strong></span></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90E)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> were suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread. The people committed disbelief in many ways, which they were not aware of. They applied analogy and considered the ability of the Lord, His signs, His rulings, His commands and His prohibitions according to their own intellects and opinions. So whatever accorded with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever ran contrary to their intellects, they rejected it. So Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread.” </strong></span>After the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> had been apparent in the <em>quroon al-mufa<u>dd</u>alah</em> (most excellent generations) and the people of evil had been subdued, then the affair became turned around and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and the people of falsehood became apparent. However, this will not persist. Even if the people of falsehood become apparent at one time then they will decline in the future and they will collapse in the future. And the final outcome will always be for the people of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to their Lord. And Imaam Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the truth is aided and tested so do not be surprised for this is the way of the Most Merciful.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they applied analogy,” </strong></span>Analogy (<em>Qiyaas)</em>, meaning in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) has no analogy in it because it is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon direct text). Action with regard to it is not upon except a proof. And no analogy is made in matters of creed and belief. Analogy can only be in <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they considered the ability of the Lord and His signs and His rulings and His commands and His prohibitions in accordance with their intellects and their own opinions.” </strong></span>This is al <em>qiyaasul baa<u>t</u>il</em> (the false and futile analogy) making analogy with regard to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, the One Who cannot be imagined by their minds and their opinions. So they rebut based upon the analogy of their intellects, the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So whatever conformed with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever was contrary to their intellects, they rejected it.” </strong></span>So they make their intellects and their opinions the judge, so whatever conflicts with it, they reject it, either by <em>ta·weel</em> (interpreting it away) or by <em>raf<u>d</u></em> (directly rejecting it) and not accepting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“So therefore, Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.” </strong></span>Just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just the same as it began. So give glad tidings of a tree in Paradise to the strangers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So then they said, “Who are the strangers O Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “Those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in one narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Those who correct whatever the people corrupt.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They correct themselves are upon correctness and they correct whatever the people have corrupted. They are the <em>ghurabaa</em> (strangers). Why are they called strangers (<em>ghurabaa)</em>? Because those who contradict them are many and those who criticise them are many, so they are strangers amongst the people of their own lands and the people of their own time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Quote being from his famous poem <em>Al-Kaffiyaat ash-Shaafiyah</em> along with the explanation of it, they give a reference there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned in his explanation, “This seems to be referring to the like of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah. They brought this matter of analogy and their intellect into the religion and used it to reject the texts; texts with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High and other than them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh Aal Ash Shaykh</strong> continues with the wordings of the <u>h</u>adeeth but this part of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Muslim (145) of a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> without what follows in the main text here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported by Muslim (146) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> from the Prophet that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just as it began and it will retreat between the two mosques just as a snake returns to its hole.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> As for the wording, when the companions asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers, O Messenger of Allaah? Then he replied, “They are those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This wording is reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em> and <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em>, <em>Al-Mu`jam as-Sageer</em> from Sahl ibn Sa`d as-Saai`dee. Al-Haythamee said in <em>Majma` az-Zawaa`id</em>, its narrators are those of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for Bakr ibn Sulaym and he was reliable as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side point, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy declared this narration authentic in <em>As-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> under <u>h</u>adeeth no. 1273,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strangers are those who are upon correctness themselves when the people become corrupted.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last wording that’s mentioned, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They are those who correct whatever the people corrupt,”</strong> </span>that is reported by At-Tirmidhiyy and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>al-Kabeer</em> from a narration of `Amr ibn `Awf that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger. So give glad tidings to the strangers, those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me from my Sunnah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy said, “This <u>h</u>adeeth is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of <u>T</u>irmidhiyy declared this particular report here as <em><u>d</u>a`eef jiddan</em> (very weak, not authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the footnote also, they mention a further wording reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and ad-Daarimee and Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Mas`ood that contains the wording, it was said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers? And that he said, “An-nuzzaa` minal qabaa-il (they are the scattered ones from amongst the tribes).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention here that Imaam al-Bukhaariyy declared that narration to be <u>h</u>asan, as was reported from him by his student, a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy. And Al-Baghawee said in <em>Shar<u>h</u>us Sunnah</em>, the <u>h</u>adeeth is <em>sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>gareeb</em> with a singular chain. And again this particular report here was declared <em>da`eef</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in the checking of <em>Sunan Ibn Maajah</em>, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> said About The Rafidah (Shia)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><br />
Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Rawafidah (Shia)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Rafidah are  the <em>Munafiqoon</em> (hypocrites) of this Ummah.’<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- From the Non-Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed <em>Rafd </em>(the religion of the Shia) came from the non-Arabs, as for the Arabs they were not Rawafid, but after the non-Arabs had mixed with the Arabs there occurred Rawafidah amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for the spread of ignorance in the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> century amongst the Arabs caused them to be lost, and they became an easy morsel in the hand of the one who wanted them.  However, when they were busy with knowledge it was not possible for anyone to divide them up and overcome them.’<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Zaydeeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever investigates the situation of the Rawafidah, will find that no one says what they say except the <em>Kuffar</em>.  The majority of scholars make <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rawafidah. The Zaydeeyah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(Innovators), the term is not given except to the Zaydeeyah and also whoever becomes a Shi’ee. The Zaydeeyah do not have <em>Asaneed</em> (chains for narrations), rather their reliance is upon books which do not  have <em>Isnaad</em>.’<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – </strong><strong>Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the seventh and eighth century you would not find except the Rawafidah (Shia) in Madina and likewise in Makkah, this is what Ibn Taymeeyah, Dhahabi and Sakhawi mention.  I believe that there is no enemy of the Muslims the likes of the Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews. The founding father of the Rawafidah was Abdullaah bin Saba and he was a Jew.  Shaykh ul-Islaam wrote a chapter in the book ‘<em>Minhaj as-Sunnah</em>’ explaining the resemblance of the Rawafidah (Shia) to the Jews. If the leaders from the Muslims had not used politics to deal with the Rawafidah and the Jews, they would not have been secure from their cunning evil.  The Rawafidah do not know anything about Islaam.’<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘a – The Rawafidah took their religion from the Jews, and their attacking the Companions is attacking Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – When the Asha’areeyah<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> affirmed seven <em>Sifaat</em> (Attributes) of Allaah, they did not do this because it is present in the Qur’aan, rather they affirmed them because the intellect did not oppose them, if they had affirmed them due to the Qur’aan then they would have affirmed the rest of the <em>Sifaat</em>.’<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – The Term ‘Rawafidah’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The evidence of the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth that the Ahadeeth which mention the word ‘ar-Rawafid’ are Ahadeeth which are lies, whereby this title was not applied except at the time of the Abbaseeyeen.’<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6 – <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rafidah<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed when Imam Ahmad was asked about the Rafidah he answered that they were <em>Kuffar</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘Some of the people of knowledge have said that the Rafidah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(people of <em>Bida’</em>)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘This statement that they are people of <em>Bida’</em> is a light statement about them, since their actions are the actions of the <em>Kuffar</em> and likewise are their statements.’<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Rafidah say that Ali <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em> will be sent before the Day of Judgement.’  They mean in place of Isa <em>-alayhi as-Sallaam</em>.’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>For a Brief Biography of the Shaykh refer to <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/10/10/scholars-biographies-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/">Here</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statements here were taken from the biography of the Shaykh, which was compiled by the Shaykh’s son AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari who is a teacher in the faculty of Hadeeth in the prestigious Islaamic University of Madina. The Collection is called: ‘al-Majmoo’ Fee Tarjama al-Allama al-Muhaddith ash-Shaykh Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> wa Seeratahi wa Aqwaalihi wa Rihlatihi’. It is a large two-volume collection of the sayings, wisdom and various biographies of the Shaykh. The statements in this translation are all from his son AbdulAwal  quoting his father unless stated otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Part One</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Compiled by Abu Abdurahman Makki<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, may praise and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah, upon his family, his Companions and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – al-Imam ‘Aamir ash-Sha’abee (d. 105 A.H.) – rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I warn you against misguided desires, and the most evil of them are the Rafidah. That is because from them there are Jews who immerse themselves into Islaam to try to prepare it to enter their misguidance just like when Paul the son of the King of the Jews immersed himself into Christianity in order to enter their misguidance into it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then ash-Sha’abee said: ‘<strong>The Rawafid did not enter into Islaam out of desire or from awe of Allaah but rather out of hatred for the people of Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Talha bin Mussarraf (d. 112 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Regarding the Rafidah, their women are not to be married nor is the meat from the animal they slaughter to be eaten because they are apostates</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Abu Hanifa (d. 150 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Jamaah is to prefer Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali and Uthmaan, and they do not belittle or find anyone deficient from amongst the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Imam of Dar-al-Hijra Malik bin Anas al-Asbahi (d. 179 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no part, [or he said: no share] in islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Al-Lailka’ee narrated that Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Allaah – Azza wa Jal – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties from Allah and to please Him.</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>; the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who migrated with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Then Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين تبؤوا الدار والإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين جاءوا من بعدهم يقولون ربنا اغفرلنا ولأخواننا الذين سبقونا بالإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reward is for these three types, but whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he is not from these three and he has no truthful right to be amongst these three.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – Al-Qadi Abu Yusuf -rahimullaah – (d.182 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>I do not pray behind a Jahmi, nor a Rafidi, nor a Qadri</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – AbdurRahman bin Mahdi -rahimullaah – (d. 198 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>They are two nations: al-Jahmeeyah and Rafidah.’ (Meaning not from the Muslim Ummah)</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Imam Shaafi’ee -rahimullaah – (d. 204 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>A Rafidi has no intercession, this is only for a Muslim</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Faryaabi – rahimullaah- (d. 212 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I hold the opinion that the Rafidah and the Jahmeeyah are nothing but heretics (unbelievers)</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – Ahmad bin Yunus – rahimullaah – (d. 227 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed we do not eat the meat of the animal slaughtered by a Rafidi, because to me he is an apostate.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – Ahmad bin Yunus also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a Jew slaughtered a sheep and a Rafidi slaughtered one as well, then I would eat from the meat slaughtered by the Jew, and I would not eat from the meat slaughtered by the Rafidi because he has apostated from Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal said to a person about Ahmad bin Yunus: ‘Go to Ahmad bin Yunus since indeed he is Shaykh ul-Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – Imam as-Sunnah Ahmad bin Hanbal – rahimullaah – (d. 241 A.H.) was asked by his son Abdullaah bin Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I asked my father about a person who curses a person from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:  ‘I hold the view that he is not upon Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I asked Abu Abdullaah about the person who curses Abu Bakr, Umar and Aeysha?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: ‘I hold the view that they are not upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I heard abu Abdullaah saying that Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever curses the Companions of the Prophet – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – then he has no share, or he said: no share in Islaam</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khalaal said: AbdulMalik bin AbdulHameed informed me, who said, I heard Abu Abdullaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever cursed [the Companions] I fear disbelief upon him, like that of the Rawafid</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever cursed the Companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then we do not find any security for him that he has indeed exited from the Deen</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 – Al-Khalaal said: Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘I asked my father about a person who curses a man from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not hold him to be upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Imam Ahmad also said about the Rafidah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They free themselves from the Companions of Muhammad <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> they curse them, belittle them and they make Takfeer (excommunication) of their leaders except four of them: Ali, Amaar, al-Miqdad and Sulayman, and the Rafidah have nothing to do with Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – Imam al-Bukhari -rahimullaah – (d. 256 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not care if I prayed behind a Jahmi and a Rafidi, or prayed behind a Jew and a Christian, and they are not given Salam, nor are they visited, or married into, nor is their testimony accepted and their slaughtered animals are not eaten.’<a title="" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 – Abu Zura’a ar-Raazi (d. 264 A.H.) -rahimullaah- said: –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If you see a man belittling any one from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>; then know that he is a Zindeeq, and that is because to us the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is upon the truth, and the Qur’aan is true.  Indeed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> conveyed to us the Qur’aan and the Sunnan, indeed they want to criticise our witnesses so that they can invalidate the Book and the Sunnah, and these (critics) are foremost to be criticised and they are Zanadiqa (heretics).</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – Al-Lalka’ee narrated by way of AbduRahman bin Abi Hatim, that he asked his father and Abu Zura’a about the Madhab of the Sunnah and their beliefs which the people of knowledge found them upon in every country , and what was mentioned from what they said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And indeed the Jahmeeyah are Kuffar, and indeed the Rafidah, rejected Islaam.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – Abdullaah Ibn Qutayba ad-Daynoori al-Baghdadi (d. 276 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the extremism of the Rafidah in love for Ali which they exemplify in placing him in front of those whom the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>and his Companions placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim is that Ali had a partnership with the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his Prophet hood, and they also claim that the Rafidah Imams have knowledge of the unseen of when someone will give birth and similar false statements, and secret matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters are gathered in that they are lies, kufr, extreme ignorance and stupidity.’<a title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em></strong> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em></strong> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan </em>and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>ar-Rahmaan</strong></em> (The One Who is Most Merciful): This is one of Allaah’s particular names and which denotes the attribute of very great and extensive mercy that exists with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[<span style="color:#808080;">See Ibnul Qayyim’s Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul Khayr, 1st. ed. 1414/1994)], vol. 1, pp. 23-24, and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s Sharhul <em>‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, ibid.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ar-Raheem</strong> (The One Who Bestows Mercy): This name denotes that the attribute is related to the <em>marhoom</em> (i.e. the one whom Allaah chooses to receive His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the difference between <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> and ar-Raheem is that in the case of the former, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His attribute, and in the latter, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His act, meaning that He is the One Who bestows <em>ar-Rahmah</em> upon others. So, when both names come together [i.e. <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>ar-Raheem</em>], then the meaning in this context is that Allaah’s Mercy is very great and extensive, and that His Mercy reaches His creation. This is what is meant by those who say that <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> is the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything (general Mercy), and <em>ar-Raheem</em> is the One who has Mercy upon the believers (special Mercy). Since Allaah’s Mercy upon the <em>kaafir</em> is a special one in this life only, then it is as if they have no mercy upon them, because in the Hereafter when they will ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to save them from Hell and admit being wrong, Allaah will deal with them with His Justice, not His Mercy, Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اخْسَئُوا فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Remain you in it [Hell] with ignominy! And speak not to Me!”</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:108)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name <em>ar-Raheem</em> is applied to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and may be applied to others. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has described His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as <em>Raheem</em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:128).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (رحمه االله) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the names of Allaah تعالى are restricted to Him only like the names: Allaah, <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>al-Khaaliq</em>, <em>ar-Raaziq</em> and so forth. Some other names, however, may be applied to other than Him.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id</em>, p. 24, <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, pp. 38-39, <em>Lum’atul I’tiqaad</em>, p. 29, <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (1:21), <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> within Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> (Riyadh, KSA: Daar Ath-Thuraya, 1st. ed. 1414/1993)], vol. 6, p. 11.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Six</strong>]: In the sixth statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pronoun of the verb { <strong>يُحِيطُونَ </strong>}<strong> &#8220;compass</strong>” refers to either all that is in the heavens and the earth or to the letter haa’ (ـهـ) in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <strong>مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong> ] “<strong>What happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past</strong>.” In the latter case, the meaning would be “Those who Allaah knows what happens to them in the future and what happened to them in the past, will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He Wills.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement, Allaah (تعالى) makes clear the perfection of His knowledge and the imperfection of the creature’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus, He (تعالى) compares His Attributes to that of His ‘<em>ibaad</em> in order that His perfection and the imperfection of the creatures become clearly evident. This is also clear in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever on it </strong>(the earth)<strong> will perish. And the Face of your <em>Rabb</em>, full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Rahmaan (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as the word ‘<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>عِلْمِهِ </strong>]<br />
“<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His Knowledge</strong></span>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is an infinitive (verbal noun) denoting either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) the ‘<em>ilm</em> of His <em>thaat</em> (Essence) and <em>sifaat</em> (Attributes), or<br />
(b) His <em>ma’loom</em> (What Allaah Knows).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the meaning of the aayah: {<strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong>} &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</strong></span>&#8220;, means either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) that we do not know anything about Allaah, His <em>thaat</em>, and His <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) that we do not know of what Allaah knows except that which He willed to be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah implies both meanings, and both are correct since we do not know of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> or <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know. Indeed, He is the One Who made it known to us that He ascended upon the ‘<em>arsh</em> (Throne); and He is the One Who taught us on the tongue of His Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم] that He descends to the lowest heaven [in the last third of the night]; and this is the case with the rest of His <em>sifaat</em>: We have no knowledge of them except that He wills. Similarly, what Allaah knows regarding what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, our knowledge thereof is restricted to that which He willed for us to know. After all, He is the One Who informed us of the existence of the angels in the heavens and that there are seven heavens. So it is with respect to the rest of what Allaah knows, we are aware of that which He willed for us to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even that which He has made known, many of us are unaware of it; the knowledge thereof are attained only if He wills. In the human being, there are many things which people [i.e. scientists] are not yet fully aware of. They gradually attained the knowledge that they knew not before. So, the aayah comprises both of the meanings discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we do not know anything of what Allaah knows even that which concerns ourselves except that which He wills, and that we do not compass anything about Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> and <em>sifaat</em> except that which He wills. Therefore, whatever Allaah wills for His creatures to know, whether in relation to His <em>thaat</em>, <em>sifaat</em>, <em>asmaa</em>’ (Names), or Actions; or with respect to His creation or His legal ways which He revealed to His Messengers, then He (تعالى) will make it known for them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Decsription of the Names are transcribed from above Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Name: </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <em>Allaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire. </strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is &#8211; <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> name</strong> that the Shaykh quotes, <strong>الأحَد</strong>  <em>Al-A<u>h</u>ad</em> (the Unique), the One Who is alone and unique in every sense, the One alone in His oneness, in His self and in His attributes, alone in His divinity.</p>

These 4 names are out of alphabetical order and put together because they are all explained in an authentic <u>h</u>adeeth in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim explained by Allaah’s Messenger himself <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al Awwal</em> (the First), is the One Who was before everything without any beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Five]: Then Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) said in the Fifth Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge, according to the scholars of <em>usool</em> (the fundamental principles of <em>deen</em>), is the definitive comprehension of a thing in conformity with its true nature.Thus, the lack of comprehension is ignorance, the indecisive comprehension is doubt, and the assertive comprehension that does not concur with reality is compounded ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if you were asked, “When did the expedition of Badr [59] take place?” And you say, “I do not know,” then this is <strong>ignorance</strong>. If you were asked the same question and you said, “It happened in the second or the third year of <em>hijrah</em>,” then this is <strong>doubt</strong>.[60] And if your answer to the same question was, “The fifth year,” then this is <strong>compounded ignorance</strong>.[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, knows things comprehensively and with perfection, overall and in detail. His knowledge is unlike the knowledge of ‘<em>ibaad</em>. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah knows what happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past.</span></strong>[62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conjunctive noun {<strong>ما</strong>} is a form of generalization (gram.) This comprises everything be it small or great, or whether it is from the actions of Allaah or from the creatures’ deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing what happens to them in the future implies that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is not unaware of the future, and that His knowledge of the past necessitates that He does not forget the past. That is why when Fir’awn said to Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>):</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَىٰ</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“What about the generations of the old?”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:51)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلَا يَنسَى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The knowledge thereof is with my Rabb, in a Record. My Rabb is neither unaware nor He forgets.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:52)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is neither unaware of the future nor does He forget the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] The Battle of Badr occurred between the army of the believers lead by Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the polytheists of Quarysh and it took place on the 17th of Ramadaan of the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Because you give another answer, which you think has the same possibility of being the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] This is known as <em><strong>al-jahlul-murakkab</strong></em>, which is to comprehend something in a way contrary to its true reality. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> (Burmingham, UK: Al-Hidaayah Publication, 1st. ed. 1418/1997)], p. 37.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] This is one of the meanings of this great aayah. It signifies that Allaah’s knowledge encompasses everything in the past, present, and the future; nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Names of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العليم</strong> </span><strong>al-&#8216;Aleem</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The One Who knows what has been and what will be; Who ever has known, and ever will know, what has been and what will be; His knowledge comprehends all things, the covert and the overt, the small thereof and the great, the possible and the impossible, the lofty and lower spheres, etc. in the most complete manner. Nothing is concealed from Him in the earth or in the heavens.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>..So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu so and so then the times changed. The people deteriorated greatly and innovations became widespread, and there came to be many callers to other than the way of the truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/differing-and-fitan-increased-after-the-excellent-generations-had-passed-away" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu (tribe) of so and so. Then the times changed greatly and innovations became widespread,” </strong></span>Differing increased and <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations; discord) increased after the excellent generations had passed away until there came the time of the `<em>Abbaasiyyeen</em>; the `Abbaasid Khaleefahs and Al-Ma`moon al-`Abbaasee appeared amongst them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> And he was followed by Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and by Al-Waathiq and they adopted the saying of the <strong><em>Jahmiyyah</em></strong>; this deviant sect and they wanted to force the people of the Sunnah upon the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And they killed some of the <em>Imaams</em> and they lashed others from them. However, the truth remains firm and all praise is for Allaah; it does not depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the callers to other than the way of the truth and of the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> became many.&#8221; </strong></span>Many people today say that they are <em>du</em>`<em>aat</em> (callers) and that they are <em>Jama`aat</em> (groups) and there are sects beneath this cover of <em>da`wah</em> (calling); being <em>du`aat</em> (callers) and what they want is to call the people to misguidance except for those whom Allaah has mercy upon from those who remain upon the call to the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology; way of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his call. Then this one is upon truth and this is the call of truth. Not everyone who carries the name of giving <em>da`wah</em> will be correct until his methodology (<em>manhaj)</em> is looked into, the methodology, which he precedes upon. So if he precedes upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, then he is a caller to truth. And if he is contrary to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was upon in the methodology of <em>da`wah</em> then he is upon <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (falsehood). So a person should not be deceived by someone saying that he is from the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) for indeed there are <em>du`aat</em> (callers) who are at the gates of the Hellfire and whoever obeys them, they will throw him into it just as he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And therefore, the author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“</strong><strong>and there became many callers to other than the way of truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.” </strong></span>Just as is the case now. There are many who claim that they are calling to Islaam underneath this cover. So if their <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) is looked into and their activities then they are found to be in total opposition to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And trials came about with regard to everything, which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> had not spoken about nor anyone from his companions </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em></strong><strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them). </strong></span>Speech became plentiful and differing and rumour mongering and claims of knowledge. However, all of this will fade into insignificance and what is indicated by the Book and the Sunnah will remain and it is the sound methodology and the straight path. However, this requires two matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>Al-`ilmu-Naafi’</em>: Beneficial Knowledge; <em>`ilm</em> by which that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions and those who followed them upon good were upon.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> <em>As-<u>S</u>abaru Wath-Thabaat</em>: Patience and firmness and that you do not move away; depart along with the discord; trials and tribulations or along with the callers to misguidance. Rather, that you should be <em>thaabit</em> (firm) and be patient upon whatever strikes you from rebukes and blame or threats. As long as you are upon the truth then be patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ ۖ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have patience upon whatever befalls you. Indeed that is from those affairs which Allaah has firmly commanded. </strong></span>(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator&#8217;s side point: At the beginning of the time of the `<em>Abbaasids</em> and this <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon, he became the <em>Khaleefah</em> in the year 198; the end of the 2nd century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s footnote: This is part of the <u>h</u>adeeth of <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it contains the wording that <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> said; the famous <u>h</u>adeeth about the different stages in the future, what will happen to this religion, we used to be upon good, we used to be upon evil, he mentions then that Allaah gave this good to us, will there be any evil after this good?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said within that <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I said, so will there be any evil after this good?” So he </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> said, “Yes, there will be callers at the gates of the Hellfire, whoever responds to them in that, they will cause him to be cast into it.” He said, “I said, O Messenger of Allaah, describe them to us.” So he said, “They have our skin and they speak with our tongue.” So, I say, “What do you command me if that reaches me?” He said, “That you adhere to the united body of the Muslims upon the truth and to their ruler.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This is how the religion was until the <em>Khilaafah</em> of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan. Then when `Uthmaan </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em></strong><strong> was killed, schism; splitting and differing and innovations came about. The people split into parties and sects. Amongst the people were those who remained upon the truth when the changes first started to occur; they spoke with it, acted upon it and called the people to it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388976028&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-killing-of-uthmaan-ibn-affan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is how the religion was till the time of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan.” </strong></span>In the lives of the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (the next generation after companions), those who opposed the truth kept themselves hidden and they concealed themselves amongst the people such as the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and other than them and that was on account of the strength of Islaam and the strength of the Muslims until the Jews infiltrated. A Jewish man from Yemen who was called Ibn As Sawdaa` `Abdullaah ibn Sabaa`; the Jew. So, he came to Al-Madeenah and he manifested Islaam in the caliphate of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and he began speaking ill of `Uthmaan in gatherings because he was just claiming to be a Muslim as a plot against Islaam.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he started spitting out his poison in gatherings and the foolish people attended and the scoundrels, evildoers and the ignorant ones. And some people or indeed many people desire vilification, they like to hear people being abused, been spoken ill of and they like <em>qeel wa qaal</em> (rumour mongering). So therefore they gathered around him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when his reality became known and he was expelled from Al-Madeenah, he went off to Egypt and he found a village in Egypt, which was famous for dissension, splits and the like. So he immersed himself in it and he spread his poison in it and he vilified; spoke ill of `Uthmaan. Then in the end, he organised a group of them having weapons and strength. So they came to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and raised objections to him and declared him to be in error. So `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded to them and refuted them; refuted their doubts. Then they went back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they rebuked themselves whilst they were on the way and they said we have achieved nothing then they went back to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and they encircled him whilst he was in his house and the companions wanted to defend the <em>Khaleefah</em>. However, `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> forbade that for fear of <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and for fear of shedding blood hoping that the affair could be dealt with upon the basis of discussion and examination. He wanted to convince them. However, when they saw that they could not reach anything by using evidence then they sprang upon him during the night whilst the rest of the people were sleeping and they killed him <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they saw that their false doubts had been refuted and that they were not going to be accepted then they ceased the opportunity at a time of inattentiveness. And most of the people were performing Hajj and the people still in Madinah were asleep in security and the matter was under discussion and being examined. So they sprang upon him by night, may Allaah disfigure them. They sprang upon in his house and they killed him as a martyr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> whilst he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and he had the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em>; the written copy of the Qur&#8217;aan so that his blood spilled onto the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. So then <em>fitnah</em> (discord) occurred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this filthy one (Abdullaah ibn Sabaa), he claims that the <em>Khilaafah</em> should’ve been for `Aliyy and that it was not for Aboo Bakr nor for `Umar nor for `Uthmaan. Rather, that it should’ve been just for `Aliyy and that `Aliyy was the <em>wa<u>s</u>iyy</em> (the one personally appointed to take over) by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and that those people had wrongfully seized the <em>Khilaafah</em> and taken it by force from `Aliyy. And the amazing thing is that `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> did not claim this nor did he seek the <em>Khilaafah</em> nor did he say &#8220;I have more right to it&#8221;; rather, he gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (the pledge) and he heard and obeyed his brothers, the rightly guided <em>Khulafaa</em>· <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>ajma`een</em> <em>jamee`an;</em> all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then al-fitnah discord occurred between the Muslims and fighting occurred between the Muslims on account of this filthy one, this one who infiltrated the ranks of the Muslims. However, Allaah caused his hopes to become frustrated. It is correct that tribulations occurred between the Muslims, some of them were killed. However, this did not do anything to Islaam. Islaam and all praise is for Allaah remained strong and established and he did not damage Islaam at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he and the Jews did not damage this religion and all praise is for Allaah. Yes, some calamities occurred for the companions and discord and fighting, however, this was all in the cause of Allaah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>wa ar<u>d</u>aahum</em> (may Allaah be pleased with them and cause them to be pleased). And this filthy one did not really achieve anything and all praise is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a summary of the affair of the <em>fitnah</em> (discord), which came about on the killing of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And this is something which shows that it’s not permissible to rebel against the ruler and that rebelling against him brings about evil in the nation and the shedding of blood and the people have continued to suffer from <em>fitan </em>(discord) from that time till this time of ours now; and you know about the callers to discord, those who call to <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and to rebellion against the rulers and with the excuse of correcting the evil. The <em>Mu`tazilah</em> arose and the <em>Khawaarij</em>, all of them from this aspect and they still continue until this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So when `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was killed then schism; splitting and differing came about and innovations.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to beware of the callers to misguidance and their affair should not be treated lightly and that it is not permissible to speak against the rulers. And therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined hearing and obeying and not rebelling against those in charge of the affairs even if they are tyrannical and even if they oppress and even if they are sinful as long as they do not reach the level of clear and open <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). This is how Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people became sects. So from the people were those who remained firm upon the truth when things first changed; and who spoke with it and acted upon it and called to it.” </strong></span>When the <em>firq</em> (sects) came about and differing, then Allaah caused the people of the truth to remain firm upon the truth and upon the Sunnah and they preceded upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> had been upon. And the other sects contradict it, what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions had been upon. So therefore they became deserving of the threat of the Fire in accordance with the degree of what occurred from them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>The Command to call upon Allah By His grace and kindness</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord said: &#8220;Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</strong></span><br />
( Soorah Ghafir 40:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encourages His servants to call upon Him, and He guarantees to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan Ath-Thawri used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O You Who love most those who ask of You, and O You Who hate most those who do not ask of You, and there is no one like that apart from You, O Lord.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly; the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah hates not to be asked, and the son of Adam hates to be asked.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said that Ka`b Al-Ahbar said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This Ummah has been given three things which were not given to any nation before, only to Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) When Allah sent a Prophet, He said to him, `<em>You are a witness over your nation</em>.&#8217; But you have been made witnesses over mankind;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It was said to the Prophets individually, `<em>Allah has not laid upon you any hardship in religion</em>,&#8217; but He said to this entire Ummah: <em>(and﴿ Allah</em> ﴾<em>has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</em>) (22:78) and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) It was said to the Prophets individually; `<em>Call upon Me, I will answer you</em>,&#8217; but it was said to this Ummah, (<em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Call upon Me, I will answer you</span></strong></em>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#808000;">Indeed the supplication is the worship</span>.</strong> )&#8221; Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord said: &#8220;Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221;</strong></span>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also recorded by the Sunan compilers; At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; It was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Jarir with a different chain of narration. Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, those who scorn My worship</strong></span>) means, `those who are too proud to call on Me and single Me out,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span></strong>) means, in disgrace and insignificance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin Shu`ayb from his father, from his grandfather that the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The proud will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the image of people, and everything will be stepping on them, humiliating them, until they enter a prison in Hell called <em>Bulas</em>. They will be fed flames of fire, and given for drink a paste of insanity dripping from the people the Fire</strong></span>.)&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seven]: Then Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over the heavens and the earth encompassing them all, He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kursi</em> [literally: footstool] is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayn</em> (place of the Feet) of Allaah, Most Mighty and Most Majestic, and it is before the ‘<em>arsh</em> like a front to it. This was authentically related by ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) in a <em>mawqoof</em> [63] type of narration. This is agreed upon by the majority of <em>ahlussunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>. In fact, this is asserted by Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah, [Imaam] Ibnul Qayyim, and others from the people of knowledge and from the verifying scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some have said that <em>al-kursi</em> is the ‘<em>arsh</em> itself. However, this is not true because the ‘<em>arsh</em> is greater, more spacious, and more profound in its extent of encompassing than <em>al-kursi</em>. It has also been narrated on the authority of ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) that <em>al-kursi</em> represents Allaah’s Knowledge. But I do not think that this narration is authentic because this meaning (i.e. knowledge) is not the true meaning for the word al-kursi in the classical Arabic language nor in the common (‘urfi) language. In fact, it is very unlikely that this transmission from ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is an authentic one [64]. Hence, <em>al-kursi</em> is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatness of <em>al-kursi</em> is clearly stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The seven heavens and the seven earths by the side of <em>al-kursi</em> are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land, and such is <em>al-kursi</em> with respect to <em>al-’Arsh</em> (the Throne).”</strong></span> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the vastness of these immense creations and which are, with respect to us, from the world of <em>al-ghayb</em>. That is why Allaah سبحانه و تعالى says:</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not looked at the heavens above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He سبحانه و تعالى did not say: “<strong>Have they not looked at al-kursi (or al- ‘arsh)&#8230;</strong>,” because this is something that is not seen by us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had it not been that Allaah had informed us about it (<em>al-kursi</em> or <em>al-‘arsh</em>), we would not have known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span>, supports the opinion held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and by other verifying scholars that the heavens and the earths all have a spherical shape, because this is a matter acknowledged by sensory perception, and through information, though the latter method may have been hidden from many of the preceding people. The proof for this from the Qur’aan is in the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the heaven is split asunder [on the Day of Resurrection], and listens and obeys its Rabb,—and it must do so; And when the earth is stretched forth&#8230;</span></strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Inshiqaaq (84:1-3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when the earth is stretched forth,&#8221;</span> </strong>necessitates that it is now unstretched. In addition, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said that on the Day of Resurrection, the earth will be stretched forth like stretched leather, the example of which is drawn for emphasis. [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Yukawwiru</em> the night around the day </strong>[making it to be a covering upon the day]<strong> and <em>Yukawwiru</em> the day around the night.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:5)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Yukawiru</em> means: “to wind round,”[67] like in our saying, “the <em>akwaar</em> (singl. <em>kawr</em>) of the turban,” meaning the turns of the turban upon the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the day and night succeed each other upon earth and in doing so, this entails that the earth is spherical, because a thing would not be wound around in a round form except upon something ball-shaped. Nowadays, it is witnessed that the earth is spherical in form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that <em>al-kursi</em> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth is evidence that it is wound round in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding <em>al-‘arsh</em>, it has been reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described it as being like a dome above the heavens.[68] The dome-shape being round but neither fully spherical nor flat, and its middle is high like that of a tent. [69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah سبحانه و تعالى]<strong> feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them </strong>[i.e. the heavens and the earths]<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This attribute of Allaah [feeling no fatigue] is an Attribute of negation. So, what are the Attributes required for guarding and preserving [the heavens and the earths] such that we know that this negation [of fatigue] is in fact an affirmation of their perfection? It is essential that the guarding and preserving require Life, Knowledge, Ability, Might, Mercy, and possibly other attributes. What is important is that the negation implies the perfection of Allaah’s Knowledge, Ability, Might, and Mercy as well as the other related Attributes that are entailed by His (سبحانه و تعالى) preserving and guarding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] <em>Mawqoof</em>: lit. “stopped”. It is a narration from a companion only. The hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is called <em>marfoo</em>’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented, “Had it not been that Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is one whom it is said that he takes from the Israelite transmissions (<em>israa’eeliyyaat</em>: narrations from the traditions of the People of the Book), we would have said that this transmission (regarding <em>al-kursi</em>) takes the form of <em>marfoo</em>’ tradition, because it deals with knowledge of <em>al-ghayb</em> (the world of unperceived realities). When it comes to this kind of knowledge, there is no room for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deductions). When a <em>sahaabi</em> (companion) says or does something which is not within the scope of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then it takes the <em>marfoo</em>’ type of tradition. The exception, however, is that if the narration from the <em>sahaabi</em> is of the form of <em>akhbaar</em> (news telling, relating information), then, if it is known that a <em>sahaabi</em> narrates from Bani Israa’eel, his transmission would not be <em>marfoo</em>’ because of the possibility that its source may be from Bani Israa’eel (an Israelite transmission). Knowing that the scholars are scrupulous in their inspection of what is attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), they do not rule that a particular transmission is <em>marfoo</em>’ except when all of the possibilities that may hinder this ruling are ruled out.” Tafseer Aayat Al-Kursi, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: This report from Ibn ‘Abbaas is related by ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-Imaam Ahmad (As-Sunnah: 586), Ibn Abee Shaybah (al-&#8216;Arsh: 61), Ibn Khuzaymah (At-Tawheed: 248), and by alHaakim (Al-Mustadrak: 2:282) who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of alBukhaari and Muslim. Imaam ath-Thahabi agreed to the authentication of al-Haakim. Ad-Daaraqutni reported it in his book As-Sifaat (36) as mawqoof from Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said: “Its <em>isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, and its narrators are all reliable.” (Mukhtasar Al-’Uluw: 45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Shaykeh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah (Al-Fataawaa, 6:584), and Shaykh al-Albaani (AsSilsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109), stated the weakness of this narration from Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (Al-&#8216;Arsh, 58), and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ wasSifaat, 862) with both narrations being from the way of Abee Thar (radhi Allaahu anhu). Shaykh al-Albaani (As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109) stated that there is no single authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) regarding <em>al-kursi</em> except this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] Reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (Tafseer at-Tabari, 30:115-116) on the authority of ‘Ali Ibn al-Hussain. The transmission, however, is mursal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A hadeeth is categorized as <em>mursal</em> when the link between the <em>taabi’ee</em> (successor of the <em>sahaabah</em>) and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[67] The infinitive noun is <em>takweer</em>, which means to round a thing in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] This has been reported in Sunan Abee Daawood (English Translation), no. 4708 and in the Sunnah by Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, no. 575, and by others. There is disagreement regarding the authenticity of its isnaad. Imaam ath-Thahabai and other scholars of hadeeth including al-Albaani graded its isnaad as weak. Imaam Ibn al-Aye supported its authenticity. The text describing al-&#8216;Arsh as a dome over the heavens is supported by the context of an authentic narration reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (Arabic/English), vol. 9, no. 519 and in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There are one-hundred degrees in al-Jannah which Allaah has prepared for those who carry on jihaad in His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth, so if you ask Allaah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaws for it is the middle and highest part of al-Jannah and at its top is al-&#8216;Arsh of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah), and from it gush forth the rivers of al-Jannah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Arsh being the roof of the Firdaws, which is the middle and highest part of alJannah, indicates that it has a dome-shape because a thing cannot be at the middle and at its highest point (peak) unless it is round. [See Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-Fataawaa</em>, vol. 5, pp. 150-155, and the book of <em>Al-&#8216;Arsh</em> by Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthmaan Ibn Abee Shaybah (Riyadh, KSA: Maktabat ar-Rushd (checked by Dr. Muhammad Ibn Khaleefah at-Tameemi), 1418/1998), p. 333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] This is based upon additional explanation of the translated text which the author, Shaykh Ibn ’Uthaymeen, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, directly related to me on Wednesday the 16th of Safar 1419Hj, corresponding to the 10th of June 1998. He stated that this explanation fits with that of the hadeeth on the Firdaws as mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 90A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects; all of them shall be in the Fire except one, and it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth.” It was said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “That which I and my companions are upon today.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388472916&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/my-ummah-will-divide-into-73-sects-all-of-them-shall-be-in-the-fire-except-one" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects, all of them in the Fire except one and it is <em>al-Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded us to unite; to become <em>ijtimaa</em>` upon the truth.</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 89</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High, showed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388430280&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-revealed-to-his-prophet-what-will-occur-to-his-ummah-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> does not know the <em>ghayb</em> (hidden and unseen) and no-one from the created beings knows the hidden and unseen (<em>ghayb)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, no-one in the heavens or on the earth knows the hidden and unseen except Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naml (27), <em>aayah</em> 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-ghayb</em> (hidden and the unseen) is that which is hidden from us, whether it be in the past or in the future, we do not know it. However, the Prophets <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>, Allaah shows them something from the hidden and the unseen for the benefit of the <em>da`wah</em> (call to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High). And from them was our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for Allaah showed him some of the matters of the unseen and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of them for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Knower of the unseen so He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Except to a messenger He is pleased with; </strong>meaning that Allaah shows to him whatever He, the Perfect and Most High, wishes. For e.g. the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was walking along with his companions and they passed by two graves so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“These two are certainly being punished.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions were not aware that the two inhabitants of the graves were being punished. Allaah revealed it to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the punishment of the two deceased. So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"> “These two are certainly being punished.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was something which Allaah made him aware of and this was from the <em>kha<u>s</u>aa·i<u>s</u></em>, from the matters specific to the Messengers <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>. And Allaah made him aware of events that were going to occur in the future and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us about <em>Ashraa<u>t</u>is-Saa’ah</em> (The Signs of the Last Hour). He informed us about the <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations) in order that we should beware and have fear lest these matters come upon us so that we could be upon clear insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informed us for our benefit from the angle of warning so that we could safeguard ourselves. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was news for him (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that splitting would occur in the nation and it occurred just as he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed so that we should remain firm upon the truth and not go off along with those who contradict the truth.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: <em>Allaah Bi Annallaaha Ta`ala </em>and in some of the versions it has <em>Bi Annallaaha Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em> (Allaah, the Exalted and Most High). Just a slight one addition word; <em>Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (218) and Muslim (292) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: In the footnote it mentions checking of this has preceded and it will follow in the next point inshaaAllaah also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, with regard to the main point that Allaah, the Most High, shows His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what will occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection and the reference for this as some of the verifiers mention is a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6604) and reported by Muslim (2891) as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Hu<u>th</u>ayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet gave us an address; khutbah, he did not leave anything out of it that will happen until the establishment of the Hour except that he mentioned it. Whoever knew of it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it was ignorant of it and I used to see things happening, which I had forgotten so then I would recognise them just as a man recognises when something has been absent from him then when he sees it again, he recognises it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made an important point also with regard to this point that &#8220;<em>Allaah, the Most High made His Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam aware. He showed him things that would happen in his nation until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;</em>. Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, this saying contains some degree of generality. So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High did not show His Prophet everything that was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection because this is from <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is specific to the Lord of Might and Majesty. However, He showed him some events and some matters that were going to occur. And therefore, there occurs in the two sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>s from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came to the graveyard and gave the greeting, “<em>May Allaah grant you security O believing people and we will if Allaah wills be joining you</em>.” Then he said, “I would have loved that I would have seen my brothers.” So they (the companions) said, “Are we not your brothers Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “You are my companions and my brothers are those who have not yet come.” So they said, “How will you recognise those who have not yet come from your nation O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, do you see if a man had some horses with white marks upon their heads and their arms and they were amongst some dark horses, would he not recognise his own horses?” So they said, “Yes indeed O Messenger of Allaah”. He said, “Then they will come with white marks on account of the wudu and I will precede you to the <em><u>h</u>aw<u>d</u> </em>(the great reservoir). Indeed some men will be repelled away from my reservoir just as a stray camel is repelled away. I will call to them, Come. So it will be said, they changed after you. So then I will say, <em>suhqan</em>, <em>suhqan</em>, be away, be far away.”</strong><strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So this is a proof that he was not informed of everything that would occur in his nation but rather, he was informed of some things that were going to have a serious effect. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of some of that just as is written in the books of the Sunnah and that does not mean that he became aware of everything that was going to occur in his nation and everything that would occur amongst them and to them as is believed by some people and I have researched this matter of my refutation of Ibn ul Haaj in the book <em>Awza hul al ishaarah fir raddi ala man ajaza mamnu minal ziyaara</em>, the clear indication in refutation of those who make permissible the forbidden type of visitation of graves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So refer to that treatise because it is beneficial in its topic and that is from the bounty and beneficence of Allaah and His grant of success. And beware O student of knowledge of being slow or being too lazy to digest this matter because it is something that has great importance and by researching it and understanding it, you can become free from the beliefs of <em>shirk</em> and you can come to know the position of the <em>Salaf</em> well in this matter and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> summarised this point by saying the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) is of two categories. He mentioned:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Firstly, <strong><em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em></strong>: That which is totally hidden and unseen and that is known only to Allaah, nobody else knows it, and,</li>
<li><strong><em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee</em></strong>: That which is partially hidden and unseen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is partially hidden and unseen refers to that which Allaah has made His Prophets aware of just as, He, the Most High said, the <em>aayah</em> that came at the beginning:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah, the Most High, is the Knower of the hidden and unseen so He does not reveal that which He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em>; that which is unrestrictedly hidden and unseen is something specific to Allaah and the <em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee;</em> that which is partially hidden and unseen is that which He made His Prophets aware of.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن تَتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! If you obey and fear Allaah, He will grant you <em>Furqan</em>, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.</strong></span> (Al-Anfal 8:29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<em>Furqan</em>), means, <strong>`a way out&#8217;</strong>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid added, <strong>&#8220;In this life and the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, Ibn `Abbas is reported to have said, `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>salvation</strong>&#8216; or &#8212; according to another narration &#8212; <strong>`aid&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq said that `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>criterion between truth and falsehood</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last explanation from Ibn Ishaq is more general than the rest that we mentioned, and it also includes the other meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Certainly, those who have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah by obeying what He ordained and abstaining from what he forbade, will be guided to differentiate between the truth and the falsehood. This will be a triumph, safety and a way out for them from the affairs of this life, all the while acquiring happiness in the Hereafter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will also gain forgiveness, thus having their sins erased, and pardon, thus having their sins covered from other people, as well as, being directed to a way to gain Allah&#8217;s tremendous rewards,</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَآمِنُوا بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُورًا تَمْشُونَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(straight)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. And He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span> </strong>(57:28)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 51: Point 88</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that it is befitting that the servant should always have fear and concern for as long as he remains in this world because he does not know what condition he will die upon, what conclusion he will have, knowing what state he will meet Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic even if he performed every good deed.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And it is befitting that a man who has transgressed greatly to the detriment of his own soul should not give up hope in Allaah, the Most High, at the point of death. Rather, he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah whilst fearing his sins. So, if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is because of his sins.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believer-should-combine-between-fear-hope" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous matter and it is that the believer (<em>mu`min)</em> should combine <em>al-khawf war-rajaa·</em> (fear and hope) such that in performing his deeds he precedes between fear and hope. So he does not have fear on its own and so therefore despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنَّهُ لَا يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed no-one despairs of the mercy of Allaah except for the disbelieving people.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah</em> 87)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يَقْنَطُ مِن رَّحْمَةِ رَبِّهِ إِلَّا الضَّالُّونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those people who are astray.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ijr (15), <em>aayah</em> 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, </strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O my servants who have transgressed greatly against their own soulsǃ Do not despair of the mercy of Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah</em> 53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he should not fear with excessive fear, which causes him to despair of the mercy of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for this is blameworthy fear. And likewise, he should have hope in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, however, the hope should not take him and cause him to feel secure of the <em>makr</em> (plot or plan) of Allaah. Rather, he should be fearful of Allaah’s plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the plan of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is as befits Him and it is from His perfection. It is not like the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings, for <em>makr</em> (plotting) in the language is secretly striving for some harm to come upon someone else in a hidden manner such that he is not aware of it. This is what <em>makr</em> means in Arabic. So if that is done for a just cause then it is justice and this is the plotting or planning of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, for He plots against the wrongdoers and the evildoers and causes his punishment to come upon them in a way that they do not perceive and this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect. So He is praised for it but as for if causing harm to come upon someone else is not for a just cause then it is <em>dhulm</em> (oppression) and it is not permissible. And this is the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings but as for the plotting of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, then it is something praiseworthy because it is justice and fairness from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this is the difference between the two matters; between the plotting of Allaah and the plotting of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plot and Allaah plots. And Allaah is the best of those who plot</span>. </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a case of recompense for them. So it is not oppression from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. Rather it comes about as a result of their plotting. They plotted and Allaah plotted against them as a punishment for them. And this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you may act with the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters the Fire on account of the fact that he has acted with the actions of the people of the Fire and the recompense comes as a result of the action. And since his conclusion was that he acted with the actions of the people of the Fire, he will enter the Fire and the opposite is the case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance so then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters it because he performed the actions of the people of Paradise and died upon it. So the Fire will not be entered into except on account of deeds and Paradise will not be entered into except on account of having performed deeds; and deeds are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person must not be deceived by his own righteousness or his uprightness and therefore feel secure from deviation. How many believers and how many Muslims and how many scholars Allaah has caused them to deviate when acts of disobedience occurred from them? So a person should not feel secure about himself nor praise his own self. So he should not feel secure from deviation and so on account of it mix with the evil people and listen to them and look into matters of trials and tribulations. He should not feel secure for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful One.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not feel secure with regard to himself. And the <em>khaleel</em> (the especially beloved one); Ibraaheem <em>`alayhissalaam</em> made supplication (<em>du`a)</em> and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ<br />
رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… And keep me and my children away from worshipping the idols. O my Lord they have led many of the people astray.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah</em> 35-36)<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should not feel secure for himself from being put to trial and from having an evil conclusion even if he is from the most righteous of the people. And he shouldn’t despair of the mercy of Allaah even if he is one of the worst of the disbelieving ones from the people, for Allaah may favour him with repentance so that he dies upon Islaam and therefore enters Paradise. Because as long as he is still alive then he is open to this or that. So the actions are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and</strong> <strong>he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah and he should fear his sins.” </strong></span>He should think good with regard to Allaah and not despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he should fear his sins,”</strong></span> meaning he should not hope with a hope that has no fear with it. Rather, he should gather between fear and hope.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They used to hasten to perform good deeds and they worshipped Us and invoked Us upon hope and fear.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the Prophets and they used to hasten to do good deeds and worship and invoke Allaah, <em>raghaban</em> (with hope); meaning hoping for His reward and <em>rahaban (</em>meaning fearing His punishment). So the Prophets gathered between fear and hope; they did not take one aspect and leave the other aspect. They did not take the aspect of hope and leave off the aspect of fear and they did not take up the aspect of fear and leave off the aspect of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the servant should make his thoughts about Allaah good, particularly at the point of death. The scholars said, while the person is in a state of good health, he should cause the aspect of fear to predominate as a precaution and at the point of death, he should cause the aspect of hope to predominate. Because during life he is able to act and to repent and to seek forgiveness but at the point of death, he is not able to do anything so then he should give precedence to the aspect of hope. And therefore, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you should not die except that he has good thoughts with respect to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is on account of sin.” </strong></span>This is just as has preceded that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, does not grant bliss to the people nor does He punish them except on account of their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا<br />
</strong><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not oppress anyone.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 51: Point 87</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that selling and buying is lawful if it is carried out in the markets of the Muslims in accordance with the rulings of the Book and the Sunnah as long as no deception, oppression or treachery is committed, nor anything contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan or contrary to what is known.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hold as our belief that <em>al-bayy` wash-shiraa·</em> (buying and selling) is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the, Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whereas Allaah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 275)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe, do not devour each other’s wealth unlawfully but only in lawful trade upon the basis of mutual consent between you. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلَاةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْا إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُوا الْبَيْعَ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَانتَشِرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe when the call to the prayer is given on the day of <em>Jumu`ah</em> then proceed to the remembrance of Allaah and leave off trade. That is better for you if indeed you knew. So when the prayer is completed then disperse upon the earth and seek from the Bounty of Allaah.</span><span style="color:#008000;"> </span><span style="color:#008000;">And remember Allaah plentifully so that you may prosper.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Jumu`ah (62), <em>aayah</em> 9-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning of seeking bounty is to seek provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to the mosques:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>رِجَالٌ لَّا تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلَا بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Wherein He (Allaah) is glorified in prayer in the mornings and the evenings by men who are not preoccupied by trade nor by sales away from the remembrance of Allaah&#8230;</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Noor (24), <em>aayah</em> 36-37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Laa tulheehim</em> (they are not preoccupied, not diverted away). He did not say, “They do not buy and they do not engage in trade.” Rather, He said, “They are not diverted by their trading, away from the remembrance of Allaah.” Rather they attend the mosques and they pray along with the congregation, then they go off to their buying and their selling. And buying and selling is from the purest ways of earning if they are free from <em>ghish</em> (deception) and <em>khadee`ah</em> (trickery) and they are free from selling forbidden goods and from dealing in that which is forbidden and usury (<em>ribaa)</em>. So if buying and selling is free of things which corrupt it, then it is from the purest means of earning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“if the buying is done in the market places of the Muslims,”</span> </strong>whatever is brought to the market places of the Muslims then do not ask about it because the origin is permissibility unless it is something about which it is known that it is something forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“in accordance with the ruling of the Book and the Sunnah,” </strong></span>such that the well-known conditions for trade are fulfilled. So if the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>seven well-known conditions for trade</strong></span> are fulfilled then the transaction is correct and what is sold is <em><u>h</u>alaal</em> (lawful). And the origin is that the market places of the Muslims are established upon that basis.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“as long as no deception or oppression or treachery enters into it,” </strong></span>if deception enters into a transaction and an unknown factor and an element of chance then it will be forbidden (<em><u>h</u>araam)</em> because it has become a case of gambling. Or a case of <em>khidaa`</em> (trickery, swindling) such that he shows something, which is not the actual reality. He shows an item in an appearance, which is not the true reality and this is called <em>at-tadlees</em> (giving a false impression to something) and it is manifesting an item on sale in a form which pleases the one who looks at it but when it is in it&#8217;s unapparent state something different to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Adh-dhulm; as long as dhulm (oppression) does not enter into the sale,” </strong></span>such that the owner has been compelled and forced to sell it, that he was made to do the transaction for a business transaction can only be <em>`an-taraa<u>d</u>in</em> (by mutual consent). He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A business transaction can only be by mutual consent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said;</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe, do not devour the wealth of each other unjustly except and unless it is a business transaction by mutual consent. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for the correctness of the sale, there is a condition that there is pleasure and consent of the seller and that he freely chooses to do so and is not compelled to do it because compelling him is oppression; forcing him to sell something he doesn’t want to sell. Unless the forcing him to sell is due to a right that is due such that he is a person who has debts upon him and he refuses to pay them back, for in that case, the judge or the ruler can intervene and can sell from his property what would be sufficient to pay off his debts even if he is not pleased with that because this is compulsion due to a right. And therefore, they said, “<strong>The sale of a person who does so by compulsion is not correct unless it is on account of a right; <em>illaa bi-haqq</em>.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point: </strong>With regard to the <span style="color:#000080;"><strong>seven well-known conditions</strong> </span>for a business transaction to be correct,they are mentioned below very briefly:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Ar-ri<u>d</u>aa</em>: mutual consent.</li>
<li><em>Ar-rashad</em>: the one engaged in that transaction is suitable to be involved in business transactions. So it’s not permissible for a child below the age of discernment or a foolish one who doesn’t have the mental capacity to be involved in a business transaction if their guardian does not give permission.</li>
<li>The thing which is sold is some wealth, property from which permissible benefit can be taken.</li>
<li>The item sold is owned by the one who is selling it or he has permission granted to him to sell it at the time of the contract by its owner or by the legislator.</li>
<li>The ability to take and receive it.<span style="font-size:1rem;"><br />
Translator’s side-point: On the basis of a </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">h</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">adeeth; you can’t sell a runaway slave who has run away from his master, his master can’t sell him. Even if the person could go after him and chase and maybe catch him. That is not permissible. Rather, he has to have the ability to take receipt of the item being sold.</span></li>
<li>The price is something known and what is being paid for likewise is known.</li>
<li>It is a deal, which is being concluded. It is not being made a condition for something else.<strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reference: <em>Al-Mubdi`</em> of Ibn Mufli<u>h</u>, <em>Ar-Rawd al-Murabba`</em> and <em>Manaar us-Sabeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The side examples I gave here are from the notes to <em>Manaar us-Sabeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan from Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And Al-Busayriyy said in Misbaah Az-Zujaajah, its chain of narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>, its narrators are reliable. And Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said it is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong><u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said: “The restriction of the author in his saying that <strong>“</strong><em>it is performed in the market places of the Muslims</em><strong>,”</strong> This is a point which requires examination because buying and selling is permissible even in other than the market places of the Muslims. Is it not permissible to buy and sell along with the Jews and Christians? Is it permissible or not? It is permissible that you can buy and sell and have mutual dealings and lease out and rent. This is a matter about which two people will not disagree and therefore the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> restricting it by his saying “<em>in the market places of the Muslims</em>,” I don’t see that there is a necessity for that here at this point. And rather, whoever wishes to buy and sell then let him buy and sell as he wishes in the lands of the Muslims, the lands of the Jews or the Christians, in the lands of the disbelievers, whatever. However, with the condition when that transaction does not aid them upon something false and futile or upon causing harm to the Muslims for e.g. selling weapons to a disbeliever who is at war with the Muslims, that would not be permissible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> Not making hijrah due to being upon welfare and fearing poverty</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Taking money from the disbelievers (welfare) has made many of the Muslims lazy from making hijrah, and that is because they, if they work they fall into forbidden acts, and if they make hijrah they fear poverty. Also, they claim that with this money they are able to live at ease and perform their deen. So what is your advice for these people, and is hijrah from the means for provision and what is the proof for that, and are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), the treasures of the heavens and the earth are in His hand, and He has guaranteed provision for His slaves as He (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.”</strong></span> &#8211; Hud (11):6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He (<em>Subhaanahu</em>) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And so many a living creature there is that carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Ankaboot (29):60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I created not the jinns and mankind except they should worship Me. I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the Provider, Possessor of power, the Most Strong.”</strong></span> &#8211; AdhDhaariyaat (51):56-58</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon every Muslim to know that his provision has already been determined and has been written for him in a book with Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and that was also written while he was in his mother’s womb; his provision was written, and his life-span, and his deeds, and whether he would be miserable or happy. Also, the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Verily the spirit of purity (Jibreel) has inspired me that no soul will die except that it has fulfilled its provision and its life-span, so fear Allaah and do that which is good in seeking provision</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the only provision that will come to the slave is that which has been written for him, so it is only upon him that he strive to be righteous and he hasten to do acts of obedience, and it is not permissible for him to think that his righteousness and his performance of that which Allaah has ordered is going to decrease his provision, and that his laxity and negligence and his unstableness in his deen is going to be a reason for his provision to increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon all of us to know that hijrah for Allaah’s sake is one of the great means of provision as He (<em>Ta’ala</em>) said in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He who emigrates in the cause of Allaah will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty of provision.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever makes hijrah for Allaah’s sake seeking the pleasure of Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), Allaah has promised him the good promise, provision and ease and comfort, that which will be a means to infuriate his enemies. So it is upon every Muslim to ask Allaah for a portion of His bounty, and rely upon Him, and see Him to be sufficient for him, and be modest because if he sees Allaah to be sufficient for him, then Allaah will be sufficient for him, and if he strives to be modest, then Allaah will enable him to be modest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the question, <span style="color:#993300;">“Are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen.”</span> The answer is that the discussion about residing in the lands of the disbelievers and its ruling has preceded, so you, after examining what has preceded, will be able, Allaah (<em>Ta’ala</em>) willing, to give the ruling of our brothers over there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</b></span>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <i>Taha</i>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b>الحيُّ </b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b>الَقيُّوم</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] <em>Zahraawayn</em> (dual form of <em>zahra</em>): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<strong>[ االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّوم ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<strong>[ اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<strong>[ وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ ]</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[FOURTH]: In the fourth statement, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ<br />
Who is it that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word { ْ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن</strong></span> } &#8220;Who” is an interrogative noun [46] and the intended use of the interrogation in the sentence is to assert the <strong>negation</strong> [that there is none who can intercede] as evident in the <strong>affirmation</strong> phrase which followed it: { ِ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> إإِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong> </span> } “<strong>Except with His Permission</strong>.” Whenever a negation takes the form of an interrogative construct, then the statement is infused with the meaning of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Intercession (<em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَشْفَعُ </strong> </span>}<br />
“<strong>Intercedes</strong>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">know that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . Linguistically, the term “<em>shafaa’ah</em>” means to make an odd number an even one.[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 . Traditionally, it refers to the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off harm. Thus the <em>shafaa’ah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em> [48] after the worry and distress which befalls them and which they are unable to bear is an intercession to ward off a harm. On the other hand, the Prophet’s <em>shafaa’ah</em> for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> [49] to enter <em>al-Jannah</em> is aimed at procuring a benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. None can intercede except by Allaah’s Permission: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span> } His Leave is <em>kawni</em>. [50] Even Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has the greatest rank with Allaah cannot intercede except with the prior leave from Allaah. He will be granted this permission after he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prostrates before Allaah and praises Him with the great praises and glorifications which Allaah guides him to it on that day. Then it will be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;ارفع رأسك وقل يُسمَع واشفَعْ تُشَف َّع.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Raise your head and speak; you will be listened to, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”</strong> </span>[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is known] that no one have a rank with Allaah greater than that of the Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم], nevertheless, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cannot intercede except with the prior leave of Allaah. It is so because of Allaah, Most Majestic and Most High’s, perfection of Authority and <em>hayybah</em>.[52] The more a king’s authority becomes fully established, the more reverent and respected he becomes. People would not even speak in his court unless he speaks. Consider the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) relation with his companions and which Quraysh’s [53] emissary [‘Urwah bin Mas’oud] described [after finalizing the treaty of AlHudaybiyah]: &#8220;<em>And when they spoke to him they would lower their voices</em>.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is out of respect. You find that if a king is revered by his flock, then no one can speak in his court and in his presence because of the might of his authority. [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[The Conditions of Confirmed Intercession]:</strong></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (تعالى ), has made it clear that He does not permit intercession except for the one whom He approves of and whose word is acceptable to Him, and for the one He is pleased with and on whose behalf intercession shall be made. It is inevitable that Allaah is pleased with <em>ash-shaafi</em>’, the intercessor, and al-<em>mashfoo’i lahu</em>, the one on whose behalf intercession is sought.[57] Consequently, the idols of the polytheists could not intercede on their behalf with Allaah because Allaah does not approve of them. The Prophets and the righteous do not intercede on behalf of the polytheists because the latter are not approved with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the conditions for the confirmed <em>shafaa’ah</em> are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah’s permission of it.<br />
2. Allaah being pleased with the <em>shaafi</em>’.<br />
3. His approval of the one on whose behalf intercession is sought (<em>al-mashfoo’i lahu</em>).[58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] In the grammatical sense, the noun { ْ<strong>مَن</strong> ] is the subject, and the term { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ذَا</strong> </span>] is omitted for being redundant. The term { <strong>الَّذِي</strong> } &#8220;<em>he that</em>&#8221; is a relative pronoun standing as the predicate of the subject {مَن } &#8220;<em>Who</em>.” [Author’s note].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Allaah (تعالى) said: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </strong></span> }, [which means], <strong>And by the <em>shaf’a</em></strong> (even) <strong>and the <em>witr</em> </strong>(odd) [of all the creations of Allaah]. [Qur’aan <em>Soorat Al-Fajr</em> (89:3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Ahlul-Mawqif:</strong> All human beings gathered on one plane on the Day of Resurrection awaiting their accounts to be taken by Allaah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate it or to bear it</strong></span>.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercedes with Allaah to pronounce His Judgment among the people of <em>al-Mawqif</em>. They will be relieved from their long standing by virtue of his interceding with Allaah on their behalf. [See <em>Saheeh alBukhaari</em> (Arabic/English)], vol. 6, no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Jannah:</em> The believers who will be admitted to reside forever in <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em><strong>Kawni</strong></em>: Pertaining to the Universal Will of Allaah, the Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, and which is in accordance with His Foreknowledge and Wisdom. Creation, provisions, life, death, permission to intercede, and so forth exists by the Will of Allaah. Everything that Allaah Wills is certain to occur. He Willed that <em>eemaan</em> (belief in Allaah) and <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) occur, although He Loves <em>eemaan</em> and Hates <em>kufr</em>. On the other hand, the Legislative Decree (<em>al-hukm ash-shar’i</em>) comprises the Revealed Laws (<em>sharee’ah</em>) which the Messengers came with and what is stated in the Revealed Scriptures. Under this Decree, Allaah Loves that mankind believe in Him (<em>eemaan</em>) and does not Love for them to commit <em>kufr</em>. Mankind, however, may or may not believe in Allaah. In short, under His Universal Will, everything Allaah Wills is certain to pass while under the Legislative Will, what is beloved to Allaah may or may not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51] Part of a long and agreed upon <em>hadeeth</em>. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (Arabic/ English)], vol. 6, no. 3 and no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] <em>Hayybah</em>: An attribute inspiring reverence, or veneration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54]This is part of a long hadeeth detailing the story of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 3, hadeeth 891 (English/Arabic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] Kings are in need of intercessors because of the imperfection of their knowledge, might and authority. Allaah, Most Perfect in His Might, Knowledge, and Authority, is in no need for intercessors. That is why intercession with Allaah takes place only if He permits it. With kings, however, intercession is permitted with or without a king’s permission. Those close to the king, for example, may intercede without permission. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s<em> Al-Qawlul Mufeed ‘Alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed</em> (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1st ed. 1415/1994)], vol. 1, p. 330, 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56]The intercessions permitted by Allaah تعالى are six. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) will have the privilege of making three of these intercessions. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em>. This is known as the Prophet’s greatest <em>shafaa’ah</em> and it is part of the highest station of praise and honour (<em>almaqaam al-mahmood</em>) with which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is distinguished, and for which he will be praised by all creatures. It is mentioned in the Qur’aan [17:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> to enter <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercession with Allaah تعالى to reduce the punishment of his uncle, Abu Taalib because of his protection and support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He will be placed in a shallow part of Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other intercessions are not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Prophet’s intercession with Allaah تعالى that He does not cast into Hell the one who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. His intercession of taking out from Hell those admitted to it because of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The intercession to raise the ranks of the believers. This is the du’aa of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to believers and by the believers for each other.</p>
<p>[See (1) Shaykh bin Baaz’s commentary on Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> which Shaykh ‘Ali Hasan ‘Abdul Hameed compiled in his verification of Shaykh ‘AbdurRahmaan As-Sa’di’s book <em>At-Tanbeehaat Al-lateefah ‘Ala Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Qayyim, 1409/1989), p. 73, and (2) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul-Mufeed</em>, pp. 332-335].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercessions mentioned above are the ones approved by Allaah (تعالى). The annulled intercession is any intercession not approved by Allaah(تعالى ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The conditions are stated in the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Baqarah</em> (2:255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلًا</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On that day, no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Taha</em> (20:109)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan,<em>Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’</em> (21:28)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] The case of intercession on behalf of the Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, is excluded and in a very limited sense from the ruling stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ الشَّافِعِينَ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">No intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [unbelievers, polytheists]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Muddathir</em> (74:48)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taalib stood in support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and protected him from his enemies of Quraysh. The intercession on behalf of Abu Taalib is special for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Other than this special intercession, none is allowed to intercede for a kaafir. Even Abu Taalib is not saved from the Fire of Hell. Had it not been for the intercession of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Abu Taalib “<strong>would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire</strong>,” as the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said. “<strong>Perhaps my intercession will be helpful to him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow fire reaching only up to his ankles with which his brain will boil</strong>,” he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 5, no. 222 and no. 224, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul Mufeed</em>, vol. 1, p. 334].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>To Him belongs whatever </strong>(maa)<strong> is in the heavens </strong></span>[44]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> and whatever is on the earth. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name {<strong>ما</strong>} &#8220;maa&#8221; here is a conjunctive noun (gram. <em>ism mawsool</em>) taking a form of generalization. The term is used in this form in order to indicate that it comprises both the beings and their states. The meaning, therefore, is that Allaah is the One Who masters the affairs of everything in existence in the heavens and the earth: <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>sovereignty-kingship,</strong> and <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong> &#8221; <strong>&#8220;To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span> is a declarative clause in which the predicate (gram. khabar) { <strong>له</strong> } “To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <em>mubtada</em>’) which is the conjunctive noun {ما} &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <em>hasr</em> (exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that to Him (Allaah) alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Accordingly, since creating, sovereignty-kingship, and management of affairs belong to Allaah alone, it is incumbent that we should surrender to Him alone because we are His slaves, and a slave must surrender to the One Who Owns and Masters him, Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, we must stand to <strong>persevere Allaah’s pre-decree</strong> because we are His possession and anything that is owned by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then it follows that is His right to administer its affairs as He Wills. This right is the same whether His pre-decree applies to the person himself, his family, wealth, friends, country, or the rest of mankind. The important thing is that since the dominion belongs to Allaah, then it is His exclusive right to do whatever He Wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the saying of Allaah (which means),<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,”</strong> </span>the term “heavens” came in the <strong>plural form</strong> [45] while the word “earth” was stated in the <strong>singular</strong> though what is meant is the plural. In this regard, the intended usage of the term “earth” refers to the <em>jins</em> (kind).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] From the angels, jinn, and all that which exists, including which we have no knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] The Qur’aan has stated that there are seven heavens:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Who is the Rabb of the seven heavens and the Rabb of the great &#8216;Arsh?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:86)].</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 50: Points 84-86</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[84] And know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is His slave and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[85] And that whatever Allaah says is just as He said and nothing can contradict what He says and He is true to what He has said. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[86] And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F386976755&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-the-beginning-of-islaam-is-ash-shahaadataan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And you should know, O Muslim, O <em><u>t</u>aalib al-`ilm</em> (seeker of knowledge),” </strong>meaning you should be certain and understand clearly <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“that the beginning, the first part of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.” </strong></span>These two are the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel in which Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tell me about Islaam.” He said, “Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the Zakaat and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make the way to it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ash-Shahaadataan</em></strong> (the two testifications) are the first thing which mankind is to be called to. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah&#8221;. So if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property secure from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he (the Prophet) sent Mu`aa<u>dh</u> to Yemen, he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed you are going to a people from the People of the Scripture, so let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the first thing, which the people are to be called to because it is the entry point into the religion of Islaam. As for those who are lax about <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and do not give importance to it from the companions of the various calls and the present day methodologies utilising <em>da`wah,</em> then this is contrary to this tremendous fundamental principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is required with regard to the two testifications is not just to pronounce them upon the tongue. Rather, what is required is to state them upon the tongue whilst being aware of their meaning and to act in accordance with what they necessitate. However, whoever testifies that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah then it will be accepted from him. So if he is then upright upon it then he is a Muslim but if something appears from him, which contradicts them then he will be an apostate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification that <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is that you hold as your belief in your heart and that you state upon your tongue and you affirm and you acknowledge that none is deserving of worship (<em>ibaadah)</em> except for Allaah and that everything that is worshipped besides Him is false and futile. And worship of it is false and futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the one who is truly deserving of worship and those whom they worship and invoke besides Him, that is false and futile. And Allaah is the Most High and Exalted One, the Incomparably Great One.</strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah</em> 62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification <em>Anna Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em>; that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, is that you acknowledge outwardly and inwardly that he is the Messenger of Allaah. As for a person who states it upon his tongue but he does not acknowledge his messengership inwardly then this one is a <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, they say, “We testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.” And Allaah knows that you indeed are His Messenger and Allaah testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars in their testifying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p><strong> يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of the testification that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah; <em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em> is, in summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded and to attest to the truth of whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah should not be worshipped except with that which He legislated.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded; </strong>so if the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded a matter then you must comply with it.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not for a believing man nor for a believing woman when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice with regard to their affair. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed with a clear straying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah</em> 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To attest to the truth of whatever he informed of;</strong> he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about some affairs of the <em>ghaib</em> (the hidden and the unseen) of the past and the future. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to be believed regarding whatever he informed of and he did not speak from desires.</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is just revelation sent to him.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informing about something is something true and something certain. No doubt can come upon it if it is authentic from him <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the phrase: <strong>“and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited,” </strong>avoiding whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade and prohibited, that is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and whatever he forbids you from, then desist and fear and be dutiful to Allaah. Indeed Allaah is severe in punishment. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which He legislated.” </strong>Whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> legislated; conveying it from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And this negates innovations and newly introduced affairs and baseless practices, which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not command. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever does an action, which our affair is not in accordance with then it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced affairs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa· </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Caliphs)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> who come after me. Cling onto it and bite upon it with your pre-molar teeth. And beware of the newly introduced affairs for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> and every innovation is a going astray</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And every <em>`ibaadah</em> (worship), which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not legislate then it is <em>baatilah</em> (false and futile) and there will be no reward in doing it. Rather, there will be sin in it because it is a <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) and innovation takes a person further away from Allaah and will not draw him closer to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.” </strong></span>This is the first pillar and it is the entrance. Then after it comes the <em><u>S</u>alaah</em> (prayer) then after it comes the <em>Zakaat</em> then fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> then <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah’s sacred house, then the rest of the duties and laws of the religion. All of them follow on from the two testifications; the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And that whatever Allaah said then it is just as He said and none can contradict what He has said and He is true to what He has said.”</span> </strong>Whatever Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said then it is just as He has said. No doubt can ever come upon it. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer in speech than Allaah. </span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 87)</span></p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ قِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer than Allaah in saying.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 122)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: no-one is truer than Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And if Allaah, the Perfect makes a promise (<em>wa`d)</em> then He does not break it.</p>
<p><strong>وَعْدَ اللَّهِ ۖ لَا يُخْلِفُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The promise of Allaah, it is a promise of Allaah, Allaah does not break His promises. However, most of mankind do not know that Allaah will certainly carry out His promise. </strong></span>(Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when He makes a promise then He does not break His promise. And if He <em>tawa`adah</em> (threatens) something then He may pardon, He the Perfect and Most High. So there is a difference between <em>al-wa`d</em> (promises) and <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (threats). So <em>al-wa`d</em> (the promise), He never breaks a promise. And as for <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (a threat) that He has made; <em>al-wa`eed</em> (a threat) then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High may pardon and overlook and may not carry out the <em>wa`eed</em> (threat) as a mercy from Him, He, the Perfect, and as a favour from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of the revealed laws.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws, which Allaah sent down to His Messengers, all of them, in general with regard to those, which have been left unspecified and specifically with regard to those that have been mentioned specifically.</p>
<p><strong>قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “We truly believe in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and whatever the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between any of them and we submit as Muslims to Him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 136)</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “We have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(we truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and to the Prophets from their Lord.

<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we have <em>eemaan</em> (we truly believe) in all of the divine laws sent down and we truly believe that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High legislates for each time whatever is suitable for it and then He abrogates that with another revealed law, which is suitable for those who come after them. So, when Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent, he came with a revealed law, which was firmly grounded and will remain until the Hour is established. It will not be abrogated and it will never be changed. It is suitable for every time and place.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ </strong>]<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah did not say (what means): “<strong>He does not sleep</strong>,” instead He said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/asma-wa-sifaat-com/">:</a><span style="color:#008000;">{<strong> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ</strong> }</span> (which means) “<strong>does not overtake Him</strong>” in order to comprise the sleep that overcomes and that arising by choice. If you say, “Does not sleep,” it would imply that He does not sleep by choice. However, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not sleep neither by <em>ghalabah</em> (overcoming) nor by choice, because sleep is an imperfect attribute which contradicts both the perfection of the Self and the perfection in relation to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is given to sleep misses a lot of his work because of His sleeping. Consider, for example, the case of a person who has many people working for him and he sleeps a lot. He is unable to neither reckon with nor manage the business or other related matters. This is an imperfection with respect to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard to self-perfection, sleep is a deficiency because it indicates that the person’s body got tired and thus he needed the sleep as a rest from what has passed, as well as a means to renew his activity to engage in what will come ahead. That is the why <strong>the people of <em>al-Jannah</em> do not sleep</strong>—because of the perfection of their lives and bodies. No illness or the like touches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, <span style="color:#993300;">“We know that the person who does not sleep is unable to do so because of some kind of sickness or a defect, while you say that the lack of sleep is perfection. Explain.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, “This applies to the creature, and in this case perfection is a relative matter [with respect to Allaah it is perfection]. There is no doubt that the person who does not sleep because of an illness has a defect, and that is why he stays always in a state of languor and exhaustion. Thus, his welfare will not be established. This is evident from the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا </strong>]<br />
<strong style="color:#008000;font-size:1rem;">And have made your sleep as a thing for rest<br />
</strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Naba’ (78:9)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that sleep is something that will discontinue the hardship and tiredness. If Allaah would sleep, and far is He above such imperfection, then this would necessitate that He needs to rest. In addition, the creation will be ruined because they are in need of Him; even the sleeping person is in need of Allaah. In fact, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to invoke Allaah at night when he was about to sleep:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا، وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا فَاحْفَظْهَا، بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِين</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If You take my soul, bestow mercy on it [and forgive it, as in another narration], and if You release it then protect it as You protect your righteous slaves.”</strong></span> [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, it is impossible that Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, sleeps. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنَامُ وَلاَ يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.&#8221;</strong></span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word [ ”<strong>لا يَنبَغِي</strong> &#8220;] does not befit] when used in the Qur’aan and sunnah means “the thing which is absolutely impossible to be,” as Allaah (تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But it is not befitting for </strong>(the Majesty of) <strong>ar-Rahmaan </strong>(Allaah)<strong> that He should beget a son </strong>(or offspring or children)<strong>.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam (19:92)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It should be noted] that Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</strong> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">signifies <em><strong>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</strong></em> (attributes of negation: negating any imperfection and implying perfection). The rule with respect to the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the Most High, is that there is no such thing as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span> attribute of negation.[40] Indeed, when <em>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</em> are mentioned, it is because they imply the perfection of the attributes that are in contradiction to those of negation.[41] So, because of the Perfection of Allaah’s Life and <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>,[42] then neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 8, no. 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 343.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] This is because mere negation does not denote any attribute, and therefore it is not considered praise. In addition, the attributes of negation are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. General, and<br />
2. Specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of generality in negation is that Allaah, Most High, negates all imperfections implicitly denoting that all Perfection is His. For example: Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ <strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</strong> ], [which means], “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong></span>.” So, there is nothing unto Him in His Knowledge, Ability, Hearing, Seeing, Might, Wisdom, Mercy, and so forth. In this general negation, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not specify the negation. Accordingly, all imperfections are denied and all perfections are denoted, and it is stated that there is <strong>nothing like unto Him</strong> in all of His Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the specificity in negation is to negate specific allegations of imperfection. For example to deny that defects and drawbacks like forgetfulness, sleep, ignorance, having son or partner, etc. are associated with Allaah, the Exalted. Again, the Perfection is implied as against the negation. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul Waasitiyyah</em>], vol. 1, pp. 145-146.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] For example, the negation of ignorance stands for the affirmation of Allaah’s unlimited knowledge. The negation of death, which is in contradiction of life, implies the perfection of Allaah’s attribute of Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] <em>Qayyoumiyyah</em>: The Attribute denoted by Allaah’s Name <em>al-Qayyoum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] The Perfection of His Life negates that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) needs to sleep and the same is due to the Perfection of His <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>, as the created living creatures due to their imperfection need sleep. Although sleeping and eating may be considered as attributes of perfection with respect to man, as a person who does not sleep or eat is considered ill, they are perfection from one angle and defects from another. They are perfection in the sense that they indicate that the body is sound and healthy, and are defects because the body needs them to function. In reality, therefore, they are defects. Accordingly, the &#8220;perfection&#8221; in the created is only relevant, i.e. particular to the created, not shared by the Most Perfect, i.e. Allaah. Eating, drinking and sleeping are relative “perfections” with respect to the created and negated defects with respect to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah, the Most High, said about Himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ </strong>]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And it is He </strong>(Allaah) <strong>Who feeds and is not fed.</strong></span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically, the <em>Khawaarij</em> are those who rebelled against ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) in the 37th year of Hijrah (657 C.E.) and imputed <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) upon the arbitration that followed the Battle of Siffeen. They hated ‘Ali’s decision to end the <em>fitnah</em> which occurred with Mu’aawiyah (رضي االله عنه), calling ‘Ali’s acceptance of the arbitration a compromise. They also imputed <em>kufr</em> upon many of the <em>sahaabah</em> who accepted the arbitration. They did not even accept the whole of ‘Uthman’s (رضي االله عنه) Caliphate. This position stems from their misunderstanding of the Qur’aan. They deduced, wrongly, that major sins are <em>kufr</em> and thus forfeit salvation. Sin is a contradiction that nullifies faith! ‘Ali and the other <em>sahaabah</em> sinned in the eyes of the <em>Khawaarij</em> and that sufficed to nullify their state of belief! Their doctrine became famous in their rebellions against any Muslim leader who, in their eyes, committed a sin or a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) informed us before his death of the emergence of this sect and that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>They will kill the Muslims and leave the idolaters. Should I live until they appear, I would kill them as the killing of the nation of ‘Aad</strong></span>.”[103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The <em>Khawaarij</em> are the dogs of the Fire.</strong></span>”[104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) delegated ibn ‘Abbaas ( رضي االله عنهما) to call them to the truth. He succeeded in convincing several thousands of them. Those who rejected continued to spread mischief even after ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) warned them against it. He finally fought them in the battle of an-Nahrawaan (38Hj/658) and only few of them escaped and continued the secession. ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) was himself killed by a Kharijite by the name of Ibn Muljam. They split into many groups and today they survive in ‘Oman, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and in Tanzania and they are known as the <em>Ibaadiyyah</em> (<em>ibadi</em> Kharijism).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> sect was later influenced by scholastic theology and its principles became very close to those of the <em>Jahmite</em> and <em>Mu’tazilite</em> sects. They center upon the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Imputing <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali, ‘Uthmaan and other sahaabah  (رضي االله عنهم أجمعين)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The right to rebel and fight the Muslim rulers who may err or sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Justifying the rebellion and fight against disobedient Muslims (rulers and/or ruled) and that it is permissible for them to secede from the general body of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) They believe that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Qur’aan is the literal Word of Allaah Who uttered it in letter and sound and which He Spoke to Jibreel (alaihissalam), directly without a mediator, and who then brought it down to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). The Qur’aan is neither the word of Jib reel nor the word of Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) They distort the meanings of Allaah’s Attributes by resorting to figurative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Like the twelver <em>Shee’ites</em> and other deviant sects, they deny that the believers will see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. This contradicts what is asserted in the Qur’aan and authentic <em>sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) Imputing <em>kufr</em> on the Muslims who commit major sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) The majority of the <em>Khawaarij</em> deny the actual punishment in the grave that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) inflicts upon those who deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned are some of the major characteristics of the <em>Khawaarij</em>. I intended to give the reader some background about this very dangerous sect and which has influenced many Muslim groups and parties in our times leading to bloodshed in many parts of the Muslim World. The bloody confrontations are hard to stop in some places and that has distorted the view of Islam in many parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth, however, is emerging and will <em>inshaa’ Allaah</em> completely emerge on the hands of the true followers of Islam who are working hard to correct this problem with the good word without compromising the ‘<em>aqeedah</em> nor the <em>manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should be able to present the truth without imitating the <em>kuffaar</em> and their ways. In this respect, the words of Imaam Maalik (رحمه االله) are remembered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nothing will benefit this ummah to come except that which benefited its early generations.”</strong> [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the correct creed, methodology and righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit is that the Muslim should be aware that the principles of many of these sects are still alive and propagated by certain individuals and/or groups, and accordingly the believer must be cautious. [106]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 49: Point 83</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Zakaat is due upon gold, silver, dates, grain and cattle in accordance with what was stated by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. S</em>o if he distributes it then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible and Allaah knows best. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F385907090&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-obligation-of-giving-the-zakaat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third pillar from the pillars of Islaam is the <em>Zakaat</em> and it is the constant companion of the <em>Salaat</em> (prayer) in many of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan. And the Zakaat is a known due amount from the wealth of the rich to be given to the poor. And the types of wealth upon which the Zakaat is due are  four types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>An-Naqdaan</strong> (the two forms of currency); gold and silver and that which can take their place with regard to paper currency.</li>
<li><strong>Baheematul An-`Aam</strong> (cattle); camels and cows and sheep.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Khaarij minal-Ard</strong> (that which grows from the earth) with regard to grains and fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Urood ut-Tijaarah</strong> (merchandise); goods which are traded in and it is merchandise, which is offered for buying and selling.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the types of wealth upon which Zakaat is due. As for everything besides these four types of wealth, then if a person wants to give in charity from it and to donate from it then that is up to him. The door to giving in charity and donation is open wide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>So if he distributes it (the Zakaat himself) then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible,”</strong></span> it is obligatory upon him to pay the Zakaat because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And establish the prayer and give the Zakaah</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aatu</em>; meaning give it, hand it over. So it is obligatory upon the person possessing wealth that he hands it over and he is the one responsible for it. So if the ruler requests it so that he can take charge of it then it becomes obligatory to hand it over to him because obedience to him is obligatory and in order to free the one who gives it from responsibility because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to send out collectors to take the Zakaat from the owners of wealth and to distribute it to those who were deserving of it. And those who are in authority take the place of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in that regard after him. And as for if the rulers don’t demand it then the responsibility is upon the person having the wealth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> [2]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: “The Zakaat, which is due upon gold and silver is 1/40<sup>th</sup> i.e 2.5%.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) (if you have that limit then it’s payable); for silver is 595 grams. As for the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) for gold then it is 20 <em>mithqaals</em> and a <em>mithqaal</em> is 4.23 grams. (Translator’s side point: In other words, for gold &#8211; it works out at 85 grams; if you have 85 grams or more then you have to pay Zakaat upon it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dates and what has their meaning such as grapes; their <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> is 5 <em>wasaq</em> (loads).(Translator’s side point: They mention that as being something like 653 kg).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise cereal crops such as wheat and barley and corn and millet and rice, the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> for each of these is also 5 loads and 1 <em>wasaq</em>(load) is 60 <em>sa`as</em>; (60 prophetic <em>sa`as)</em>, <em>Allaahu A`lam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the cattle then the limits for them are well-known.</p>
<p>[2] <strong>Translator&#8217;s Sidepoint</strong> regarding the Zakah on merchandise, goods for trade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the 4<sup>th</sup> category of wealth i.e merchandise, goods for trade &#8211; Shaykh Fowzaan mentions here that is the view of the great majority of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al Fowzaan</strong> said in his book <em>Al-Mulakha<u>s</u> al-Fiqhee</em>, “More than one have quoted consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> of the People of Knowledge that upon goods which are traded; Zakaat is obligatory upon them, if a year has passed over them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> said: The four Imaams and the rest of the nation except for some isolated ones are agreed that it is obligatory to pay it upon the goods for trade. And you can find the rest of the speech of Shaykh ul Islaam in <em>Majmoo` al- Fataawa</em> volume 25, page 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the same point <strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> in his book <em>Nayl al-Aw<u>t</u>aar</em>, he mentioned the same view that it’s obligatory to pay Zakaat upon the goods for trade. Then later on he changed his view in other books <em>Al-Sayl al-Jarraar</em> and <em>Ad-Daraaree al-Mu<u>d</u>iyyah</em> that he mentioned something different (changed the view and said it’s not obligatory) because trade used to occur in his time (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) in all the forms of that which was traded in and it is not reported from him anything, which would necessitate this. And Imam Shawkaanee said : &#8220;Ibn ul-Mundhir claimed that there is <em>Ijmaa</em>` consensus upon Zakaat being upon trade but this quote is not correct. So the first of those who disagreed with that are the <u>Dh</u>aahirees and they are a group from the groups of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, finally <strong>Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy</strong> mentioned in <em>Tamaam ul-Minnaah</em> that his view was, he said, “<strong>What is the truth is that the saying that Zakaat is not obligatory upon the goods for trade is what is correct because there is no proof for it from the Book or the authentic Sunnah</strong>.” And then he mentioned this saying that it being not obligatory was the saying of some of the scholars before and some of the scholars such as Ataa Abee Rabaa<u>h</u> from the <em>Taabi`een</em> and Ibn <u>H</u>azm and <u>S</u>iddeeq <u>H</u>assan Khaan from the later scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side point: And likewise, Ibn Qudaamah mentioned in <em>Al-Mughnee</em> this as being the saying of Daawood A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aahiree and also related from Imaam Maalik as one saying, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><i>Related Points of Benefit from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullah)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Affirming Five Names of the Names of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Allaah</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Hayy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Qayyoum</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Aliyy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Atheem</b></i>. [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Affirming that Allaah is singled out with all worship (<i>al-uloohiyyah</i>): He is the One Who alone has the right to be worshipped, or that He is the One who is worshipped rightfully and deservingly:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{<b> لا إلهَ إلاَّ ُ هوَ</b> }<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">None has the right to be worshipped but He [Allaah].</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Refuting the claim of the polytheists who affirm other gods beside Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Affirming the <i>sifah</i> (attribute) of <i>hayaat</i> (Life) for Allaah, and that His life is one of perfection, neither preceded by <i>‘adam</i> nor coming come to naught nor characterized by imperfection. On the contrary, our life originates in <i>‘adam</i> and will come to an end, and it is accompanied by imperfection. If fact, all of our life is imperfect, and that is why Allaah described it by <i>ad-dunya</i>. [86] The Life of Allaah, however, is perfection from all angles because of His saying: {<b><span style="color:#008000;">الْحَيُّ</span></b>}The Living, where the particle <b>ال</b> is for <i>al-istighraaq</i>, which comprises all the meanings of the qualities of the perfect life, as if He says, <b>“There is no one who is truly living except He.”</b> In fact, this is the case because there is none qualified with the life of perfection except Allaah, the Most Mighty and most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Affirming the <i>al-qayyoumiyyah</i> [87] for Allaah (عزَّوجَلََّّ) because He said: {<b><span style="color:#008000;"> القَيُّوم </span></b>}. Such a description does not apply to the human being. There is not any person who is established on his own nor is there anyone who takes full charge of others by whom they subsist, because there is no human being except that he is in need of others. We need workers, and they need us. We need [our] women and they need us. We need our sons and daughters and they need us. There is no one who is absolutely in full charge (giving them care, maintenance, providing for them, etc.) of others. I may be able to take charge of someone else, but in a limited sense. That is why Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Is He </b>[Allaah]<b> Who takes charge </b>(guards, maintains, provides, etc.) <b>of every person and knows all that he has earned </b>(like any other deities who know nothing)<b>?</b></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Ra’d (13:33)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</span></b>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Taha</i></span>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الحيُّ </span></b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الَقيُّوم</span></b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The perfection of Allaah’s Life and qayyoumiyyah such that they are free from the slightest imperfection. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfection may be generalized considering what is predominant or more numerous although it may be deficient in certain aspects. However, negation of imperfection means that the perfection is absolute and in every respect is free from deficiency. In this sense, the negation occurred in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Affirming <i>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> are those attributes that Allaah has denied for His Self and which imply affirming the perfection of their opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Affirming that Sovereignty of Allaah comprehends everything. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. This Sovereignty is exclusively His. The evidence lies in the same aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">To Him</span></b><b> belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>, in which the predicate (gram. <i>khabar</i>) { <b>له</b> } &#8220;To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <i>mubtada</i>’) which is the conjunctive noun { ما } &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <i>hasr </i>(exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that: “<b>To Him (Allaah) </b><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">alone </span></b><b>belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Affirming the heavens and the earth, as in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “<b>heavens</b>” is a number. They are seven in number and similarly is the number of the earths as proven from other texts.[91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Perfection of the Kingship of Allaah, as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Kingship of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) is not the same as His all comprehensive Sovereignty. In fact, power and full kingship are more perfect than just all-comprehensive sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Affirming the intercession that is approved by Allaah as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None can intercede] <b>except by Allaah’s Permission</b>, otherwise, the exception would not be correct. Hence, had the approved intercession been not affirmed, the exception would not be correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Affirming the “Permission” which is His Command:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">[None can intercede]<b> except by Allaah’s Permission.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Affirming the ‘<i>ilm</i> (Knowledge) for Allaah and that His Knowledge comprehends the past, the present, and the future. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And Allaah Knows what happens to them</b></span><span style="color:#008000;"> (His creatures)</span><span style="color:#008000;"><b> in the future and what happened to them in the past.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Refuting the claims of the extremists from the <i>Qadariyyah</i>[92] by affirming Allaah’s all-encompassing Knowledge as in the statement. This constitutes a rebuttal of the extremist from the <i>Qadariyyah</i> who say that Allaah knows the actions of His salves only after they are carried out, denying that Allaah knowledge comprehends everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. The rebuttal of the two sects, the <i>Khawaarij</i> [93] and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> [94] by affirming the <i>shafaa’ah</i>. Both sects deny the general intercession approved for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and for others and which applies to the people who committed sin. This negation is based upon their doctrine that the person who commits a major sin and die without repenting from it will be punished in the Fire forever. The two sects differed, however, as to whether such a person is considered a <i>kaafir</i>, or neither a believer nor a <i>kaafir</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Kharijites</i>, courageous against the truth and for it, said, “<i>The one who commits a major sin is kaafir and no longer belongs to the fold of Islam</i>.” The <i>Mu’tazilites</i> were fearful to oppose the people of <i>ahlus-sunnah</i> and the <i>kharijites</i>. They took a cowardly position and said, “<i>We will sit in the middle of the road and say that the one who has committed a grave sin is in a position somewhere between the two; we neither say he is a believer nor a kaafir!</i>” Both sects, however, agreed that in the hereafter he would be in the Fire of Hell forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they denied the <i>shafaa’ah</i> (intercession). The generality of the aayah refutes the position held by both sects:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِه</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can interceded with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. None will ever encompass anything of Allaah’s knowledge nor of His Hearing or His Sight:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. We comprehend no knowledge about Allaah or about His creation except that which He wills for us to know.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Forbidding the <i>takyeef</i> (assigning a manner or a “how”) to the Attributes of Allaah, because He did not inform us of the how they are. So if we claim the knowledge of the <i>kayfiyyah</i> (i.e. the condition or the “how”) of His Attributes, then we are lying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Rebutting the <i>Mu’attilah</i>, due to His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ </b>]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence against the <i>Mu’attilah</i> because they say, for example, that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has no real Hand. This necessitates that they encompass the negation of one of His Attributes. In this respect, both sects, the <i>Mu’attilah</i> and the people of <i>takyeef</i> (<i>Mukayyifah</i>) lied because Allaah affirmed this Attribute (i.e. the Hand) to Himself. Accordingly, their claim that the true and real Attributes like the Hand, the Face, the Eyes, and so forth do not befit Allaah is false and void. The basis for this fact is that knowledge is of two kinds: (a) Affirmation, and (b) Negation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you cannot negate anything as being a quality of someone (something) except with knowledge, just like you cannot affirm anything for someone (something) except with knowledge. So if those sects would deny the realities of the aforementioned Attributes of Allaah then they must bring forth their proofs, if they are truthful. For example, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not negate that the Attribute of the Hand from His Self, not even in one single aayah in the Qur’aan, nor did the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) negate this Attribute in any hadeeth, nor did the righteous predecessors (<i>as-salaf-us-saalih</i>). Those sects, however, utter the negation of Allaah’s true and real Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Rebutting the position of the <i>Mumathilah</i> (those who liken Allaah to His creation). Since the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">implies a rebuttal of the <i>Mukayyifah</i>, then by all reason it is a rebuttal of the <i>Mumathilah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Affirming the <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Except that which he Wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Rebutting the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who say that Allaah, the Most High, does not Will anything as far as man is concerned.[96] This is evident in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass&#8230;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing that man’s compassing of something is from his qualities and his qualities are a creation of Allaah, [and hence man’s will is not independent from the Will of Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. The greatness of the <i>kursi</i>, for His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></b><b><i>kursi</i></b><b> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The Greatness of the Creator of the <i>kursi</i> because the greatness of the created implies the Greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The <i>kufr</i> of the person who denies the heavens and the earth because this necessitates accusing Allaah of lying. As far as the earth is concerned, I believe that no one denies it [its existence]. However, as regard to the heavens, there are those who deny them saying that what is above us is boundless and limitless space, and that there is only stars and diffused dust (<i>sadoom</i>) or the like. There is no doubt that the one who holds to this belief is a <i>kaafir</i>, whether he himself believes in this or he imitates those whom he reveres from the people who hold to this belief—while knowing the truth implied from the proofs of the Qur’aan and the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Affirming the Strength of Allaah, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Denying the <i>mashaqah</i> (fatigue) from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> just like saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَمَا مَسَّنَا مِن لُّغُوبٍ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us.</span></b> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:38)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Affirming what is implied by the above statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them,</span></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">from the attributes of Knowledge, Ability, Life, Mercy, Wisdom, and Strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. Affirming that the heavens and the earth are in need for someone who guards them, as stated in Allaah’s saying (which means): He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. Had it not been for the guarding and preserving of Allaah, they would have been ruined. Allaah Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَاتٌ وَمَسَاجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسْمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid (mosques), wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down.</span></b><b> </b>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَاءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>He withholds the heavens from falling on the earth except by His Leave.</b></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Sooart Al-Hajj (22:65)].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Verily! Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that can grasp them after Him.</b></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Faatir (35:41)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Affirming <i>al-’uluw ath-thaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah in His Essence) and <i>al-’uluw as-sifaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah’s Attributes) because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And He [Allaah] is the Most High, above everything.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. Rebutting both the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [98] and the <i>Mu’atilah</i> who negate this Attribute of Allaah تعالى. The Hulooliyyah say, “<i>Allaah is not above everything but rather He is everywhere</i>.” And the Mu’attilah, the people who deny Allaah’s Attributes, say, “<i>He cannot be described as being High or low, to the left or the right, or as being separated from or associated with His creation</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Warning against transgression upon others because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And He is the Most High, above everything, and He is the Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah (تعالى) said in Soorat An-Nisaa’ [(4:34)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And if they </b>[women] <b>return to obedience </b>[to their husbands]<b>, then seek not against them means </b>[of annoyance]<b>. Surely, Allaah is ever Most High, above everything, Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think proudly of yourself, then remember the Highness of Allaah above everything, the Most Mighty and Majestic. And if you think of yourself as being great, then remember the Greatness of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Affirming the Greatness of Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Great.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. Affirming the Attribute of Perfection that is implied in the combined Attribute of Transcendence and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Knowing that the <i>mulk</i> (Sovereignty) belongs to Allaah then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must not behave or act in His kingdom except in accordance with that which He is pleased, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The judicial rulings and decreeing amongst the people must be based upon the Judgment of Allaah. Indeed the reliance of man upon the judicial decrees laid by the created and the system of laws laid down by man is one kind of setting up rivals with Allaah (<i>shirk billaah</i>)[99], the Most Mighty and Most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contentment with the Pre-decree of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, because if you know that the Sovereignty exclusively belongs to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) then you would say, “This is the disposal of affairs by a Sovereign in His Kingdom, and He has the right to do whatever He wants.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they [the creation] will be asked</span></b>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’ (21:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, this understanding was part of the condolence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his daughter [following the death of her child] when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Whatever Allaah takes belongs to Him, and to Him belongs what He grants, and everything with Him has an appointed fixed term </b>[in this world]<b>.”</b> </span>[100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man should not act conceitedly upon accomplishing something because this accomplishment is from Allaah and the Sovereignty is exclusively His.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></b></p>
<p>[85]The Shaykh Uthaymeen also stated that he is in doubt whether the word إله is a Name of Allaah because it is an indefinite noun (gram. nakirah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] The Shaykh (رحمه االله) made the above statement in his explanation of Soorat Al-Kahf, in the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal,1419. Evidence from the Qur’aan is in Soorat AtTalaaq (65:12) and from the sunnah as in the agreed upon hadeeth, &#8220;<b><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, his neck will be encircled with seven earths [on the Day of Resurrection].</span></b>&#8221; [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English)], vol. 3, no. 632.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [from <i>hulool</i> (lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”]. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form. In mystic <i>sufism</i>, it refers to the Divine incarnation in the <i>sufi</i> saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah classified the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> into two kinds. The first is the <b>specific hulool</b> like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eesa (alaihissalam) and like that of the extremist <i>raafidah</i> and <i>sufi</i> mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali Ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) and in special <i>sufi</i> saints, respectively. The second kind is the <b>general hulool</b> and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [See <i>Al-Fataawaa</i>], vol. 2, pp. 171-172.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] It could be a major or a minor form of <i>shirk</i> depending upon the motive behind his reliance. <i>Al-Hamdullilaah</i>, the author, Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Uthaymeen (رحمه االله ) personally affirmed this explanation to me in Jamaada Al-Aakhirah, 1419Hj.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 49: Point 82</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">And know that the obligatory prayers are five. There is to be no increase in them nor any reduction in their set times. And upon a journey they consist of two </b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Rak`ahs</em><b style="color:#993300;"> except for the Maghrib prayer. Whoever says that they are more than five then he has innovated and whoever says that they are less than five then he has innovated. Allaah will not accept any of them unless they are performed within their times except for the one who forgets then he is excused and must perform it when he remembers it and the </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>traveler</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> who may combine the two prayers if he wishes.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F385024055&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-obligatory-prayers-are-five" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The five obligatory prayers have tremendous importance. And it is the second pillar (<em>rukn)</em> from the pillars of Islaam after the two testifications. And whoever abandons it denying its obligation then he is a <em>kaafir </em>(disbeliever) by consensus (<em>Ijmaa`</em> ) of the Muslims. And whoever abandons it <em>takaasulan</em> (out of laziness) whilst acknowledging that this is obligatory then he is a disbeliever upon the correct saying from the two sayings of the scholars. And the proof is his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between the servant and between disbelief, there is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The covenant that is between us and them is the prayer. So whoever abandons it then he has disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear. And he did not say whoever abandoned it denying its obligation. Rather, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> made it general along with many evidences, which this is not the place to quote in full.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prayers became settled at five prayers every day and night. The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to Mu`aadh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So if they accept that from you then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was made obligatory upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon his nation on the night of the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (ascent) through the Heavens, which shows its importance. They were first made obligatory as 50 in each day and night. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> returned to his Lord for a reduction until Allaah made it 5 with regard to its performance and they are 50 in the balance because a single good deed is rewarded with 10 times its like. So a single prayer is for 10 prayers. So, it is multiplied to 50 prayers but as for the action then it is 5 prayers in the day and the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So whoever says that the prayers are more than 5 then he is a <em>mubtadi’ </em>(innovator) because he has added something into the religion that is not from it and whoever says that they are less than 5 as is said by a sect of the innovators and the people of misguidance that they are 3.</strong> <strong>The prayers are confirmed by the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims as being five prayers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Establish the prayers from the time when the sun passes the Zenith until the darkness of the night and establish the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan in the dawn prayer. Indeed the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan in the dawn prayer is attended by the angels of the night and the day.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> explained them by his saying and his action and they have set times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَابًا مَّوْقُوتًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The prayer is a duty prescribed for the believers at set times.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: An obligatory duty at set times. Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> clearly explained them by his saying and his action. It is not permissible to take them out of their times except on the condition of a valid excuse such as he has slept or forgotten until the time finishes. So then when he remembers or wakes up it becomes obligatory for him to hasten to perform the prayer whatever time it is. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps through it then let him pray it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it except that.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for deliberately letting it pass beyond its time then it will not be correct from him even if he prays it because he has not prayed the prayer which Allaah commanded him with. Rather, he has just prayed a prayer in accordance with his own desires. So if he deliberately lets it go outside its time then it will not be accepted from him even if he does pray it. So what is upon him is <em>at-tawbah</em> (repentance), that he repents to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and is constant upon observance of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the number of the <em>rak`ahs</em> (prayer units in each prayer) was explained by the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. The Fajr prayer is 2 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the Maghrib is 3 <em>rak`ahs</em> because it is the odd number of prayer of the day. And the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the `A<u>s</u>r prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the `Ishaa· prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when on a journey, the 4 <em>rak`ah</em> prayers are reduced to 2 <em>rak`ahs</em>; the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer and the `A<u>s</u>r prayer and the `Ishaa· prayer as occurs in the established Sunnah from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. A</em>nd that occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُوا مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when you travel upon the earth then there is no blame upon you if you shorten the prayer.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Fajr (dawn) prayer then it remains as two <em>rak`ahs</em> and as for the Maghrib prayer then it is not shortened because it is the witr (odd numbered) prayer of the day time. So if it were shortened then the number of <em>rak`ahs</em> of the day time would become even. And this is how the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> occur regarding the prayer. So it is not permissible for anyone to interfere with them; either adding or deleting or taking it out of its time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (82) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between a man and between shirk &amp; kufr is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the Musnad and by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and an-Nasaa·ee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Buraydah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic) and it was declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and by al-<u>H</u>aakim in Al-Mustadrak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> also in his checking of at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee; declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>; you’ll find it there in a number of places; the first of them being no. 1,395 and also reported by Muslim (19) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (597) and Muslim (684) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said regarding the point &#8211; Imaam al-Barbahaaree said that &#8220;<em>whoever adds to those five or deletes from the five prayers then he has innovated&#8221;</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author here, “<strong>then he has innovated,</strong>” this is different to his usual practice for he very often uses the wording of disbelief for things which are less than full disbelief and here he used the word innovation whilst knowing that whoever says that the obligatory prayer is more than five or less then he has become a disbeliever by consensus of the People of Knowledge. This being based upon <em>Tawaatur</em> (something reported by huge number of people throughout the generations at every level).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then, these five every one of them is well-known with regard to the number of its <em>rak`ahs</em> so the dawn prayer is 2 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the <u>Dh</u>uhr and `A<u>s</u>r are 4 and Maghrib is 3 and `Ishaa· is 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible when in residence to pray less than that and whoever does that claiming that the prayer has been reduced or increased then he is to be made aware of the matter if he is ignorant and if he then still persists then he has disbelieved. So the number of their <em>rak`ahs</em> is taken by narration, which has been passed down by generation after generation from the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not permissible to pray less than that except when on a journey in which case the 4 <em>rak`ah</em> prayers are reduced to 2 <em>rak’ahs</em> as is proven by the evidences. And whoever claims that the Maghrib prayer or the dawn prayer should be shortened then he is to be made aware and if he still persists then he becomes a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, their due times have been taken from what has been passed down from one whole generation to the next by transmission of the action and transmission of the saying. So every obligatory prayer from the obligatory prayers has a separate time and its time has a beginning and an end. And it is not permissible to bring it before its time nor to delay it beyond it except that it is permissible for the traveler to gather two prayers due to the ruling of his being a traveler; either delaying the earlier one to the time of the later one and that is by consensus or bringing the second one forward and praying it along with the first one in the time of the first one in the view of some of the People of Knowledge who hold that the <u>h</u>adeeth in that regard is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is permissible for a person who is ill to combine the prayers to repel difficulty which occurs with praying each obligatory prayer in its specific time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And whoever makes just three times for prayer like the Shi`a; those who permit joining always such that they join the `A<u>s</u>r with the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer at the time of <u>Dh</u>uhr and they join the `Ishaa· along with the Maghrib at the time of Maghrib based upon the saying of some of their Imaams. Then whoever does that from them and believes it’s permissible then he is an innovator astray. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as is also the case of one who combines `A<u>s</u>r along with Maghrib (the day time prayer along with the night time prayer) or who combines `Ishaa· prayer along with Fajr then he is <em>daalun</em> (astray) also. So therefore <em>jam’</em> (combining the prayers) cannot be except two obligatory prayers, which can share in their times meaning Dhuhr prayer along with `A<u>s</u>r or Maghrib along with `Ishaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever abandons the prayer deliberately until its time has passed then he has disbelieved because of the authentic evidences which prove that. From them is his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between a man and between shirk and kufr is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The covenant between us and them is the prayer so whoever abandons it then he has disbelieved.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…to the rest of the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>jumhoor</em> (great majority) hold that the one who abandons the prayer is not a disbeliever (meaning he abandons it out of laziness) on account of that, yet still in spite of this many of them hold that his repentance should be sought. So either he’ll repent from that otherwise he is to be executed with the prescribed punishment. And the matter there is disagreement between the people of knowledge and Allaah, the Most High, knows best. Unless he leaves it on account of a valid excuse, which is forgetfulness or sleep then it’s obligatory upon him to pray it when he remembers it because of the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said “The Prophet of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps through it then his expiation is to pray it when he remembers it because Allaah, the Most High says:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِذِكْرِي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And establish the prayer for my remembrance.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20) <em>aayah</em> 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and below them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whereas, the Jahmiyyah among them <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee said, “<em>Allaah will only punish them next to the Fire</em>” in rebuttal of Allaah and His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and beneath them,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, will cause the Fire to blaze with the bodies of the disbelievers. So they are firewood for the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the disbelievers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> are fuel for the Fire.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will burn with them and use their bodies as fuel and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p><strong>فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p><strong>يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ </strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَهُم مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So those who disbelieve will have garments of Fire put out for them, boiling water will be poured down from above upon their heads. It will melt their insides and their skins. And there will be for them hooked rods of iron with which they will be beaten.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentioned that the torment will occur upon the bodies of the disbelievers and that the Fire will burn with them and blaze away consuming them.</p>
<p><strong> يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">…<strong> Boiling water will be poured down upon their heads from above. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Mu`tazilah, there are those who said, <em>“They will not be tortured and the Fire will not blaze away burning their bodies. Rather, they will be punished by the Fire only. As for their bodies then they will not actually burn.”</em> Whereas, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says in the Qur&#8217;aan that they are the Fuel of the Fire and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first of those whom the Fire will blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be the scholar who did not act upon his knowledge and the one who gave in charity who shows off in giving charity and the mujaahid (who fought in Allaah’s path) who fought to show off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong><em>al-aghlaal</em></strong> (shackles), its meaning is that his hands will be bound to his neck and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And <strong><em>al-ankaal</em></strong> (fetters) are instruments of torture.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَلَاسِلَ وَأَغْلَالًا وَسَعِيرًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains and fetters to bind their hands and a blazing Fire. </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Insaan (76), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">4)</span></p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ لَدَيْنَا أَنكَالًا وَجَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have fetters and a raging Fire.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Muzammil (73), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>al-ankaal</em> (fetters), they are instruments of torture; Allaah’s refuge is sought. Chains and shackles and a blazing Fire. And the Fire will be in their bellies inside of them and above them and beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>لَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the disbelievers) will have the Hellfire as a bed. Over them, there will be coverings of Fire and likewise, We will recompense the disbelieving wrongdoers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to this person mentioned here who needs refuting amongst others; <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee. In the footnotes they mention that Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar said about him in <em>Lisaan al-Mizaan</em>; he was <u>H</u>ishaam ibn Umar al-Foo<u>t</u>ee, he was from the companions of Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl and he was a caller to the position of the Mu`tazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> mentions in his lectures of the explanation, he said, “His teacher was <strong>Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl</strong>, well-known as Al-`Allaaf and that he had this deviated belief that those who enter the Hellfire, after they have been in the Fire for some time, they will become of the same nature as the Fire so it will become natural for them to the extent that they will feel delight in the Fire. His student <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee differed with his teacher, he refused to accept that they would actually enter the Fire. Rather, they will be punished next to the Fire, they will be scorched outside it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 8:</strong> Travelling to the lands of disbelief for tourism, business, da’wah, and marriage</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“There are some travels to the lands of disbelief that don’t include residing nor settling there, like traveling for vacation, and tourism, and traveling for business, and traveling for da’wah, or for someone who made hijrah to go get married over there.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to traveling for vacation and tourism we say; traveling to the lands of disbelief for those matters of daroorah (extreme necessity), like seeking treatment and such, there is no problem with this as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that which is for the purpose of vacation, or tourism, or roaming around or recreation, this travel is not a travel of extreme necessity because it is possible for him to go to the Islaamic lands whose people are conservative Muslims and take vacation there, and it will be less expensive, and he will feel safe in his journey for his deen, although the advice we give is that the Muslim focus on that which benefits him, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Focus on that which benefits you</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for traveling to the land of disbelief and shirk for the purpose of tourism and recreation, no doubt, there is great danger in that and trial on the deen of the Muslim and on his character because of what has been mentioned. Also, in that great sums of money are wasted in these types of journeys to the lands of disbelief, and over there the temptations are intense. How often has a righteous person traveled to those lands then returned corrupted. Rather, how often has a Muslim traveled there and returned as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, it is not permissible to travel to the land of disbelief for tourism, and roaming around and recreation. That is so the (person’s) deen can be protected, and so he can be saved from the means of trial, and so he can distance himself from the dangers and the evil consequences, especially since the traveler travels and searches in his journey for everything that delights him and everything that entertains him, and you know the laxity that exists in those lands for sins like drinking alcoholic beverages, and fornication, and nudity, and decadence, and the many types of abominations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, those disbelievers have prepared their lands for these purposes and compete with one another in that. And, all praises are due to Allaah, the people of knowledge have given the legal verdict that it is forbidden to go to the land of the disbelievers for tourism and roaming around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling for the purpose of business, some of the people of knowledge allow that, and some of the people of knowledge see that to be forbidden and don’t allow that because of the severe danger which the Muslim is subject to over there. Whatever the case may be, our advice is that the Muslim beware of going to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of business as much as possible because of the danger in that on the deen and on the character, and because of the great evils which have already been mentioned, especially since the one who wants to do business, he brings with him on his journey large sums of money, and you know that the abomination is at hands reach, we ask Allaah for safety and wellbeing. However, if he is going to travel for his business to one of the remote lands of the disbelievers with trustworthy company in a short time-period, in this instance it could be said to be permissible. As for most of the lands of disbelief, there is great danger in that on the deen of the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muhaajir traveling only to get married, it appears that it is not permissible because it is not an extreme necessity, rather, he is able to marry a righteous woman over there, if one can be found, over the telephone or by the different means of communication without having to travel there because in the Muslim traveling there, as you have heard, there is danger for him, and perhaps if he goes to those lands after making hijrah from them he could long for staying there and employ different types of tricks to stay there with the argument that he is still trying to find the right wife, or with the argument that he is working for a little while so he can save money to suffice the requirements of the marriage and the journey with his family to the lands of Islaam, or with the argument that there are obstacles making it difficult to return to the land of Islaam, or because he needs some treatment or things like that, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought. So we advise that he doesn’t go for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling to those lands for the purpose of calling to Allaah, it is well known the many proofs from the Book and the Sunnah mentioning the virtue of calling to Allaah. Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِّمَّن دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who is better in speech than he who invites (men) to Allaah, and does righteous deeds, and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims.’”</strong></span> &#8211; Fussilat (41):33</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allaah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allaah. And I am not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers).’”</span></strong> &#8211; Yusuf (12):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p><strong>ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nahl (16):125</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So traveling to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of da’wah is considered to be a type of Jihaad, and it is fard kifaayah (obligatory on a part of the nation) upon he who is able to do that. So calling to Allaah, and instructing the people, and conveying Allaah’s message to His slaves, and removing the people from the types of darkness to the light, and explaining the good qualities of Islaam to the disbelievers, and educating the Muslims over there about the rulings of the deen, and enlightening them, and instructing them, and encouraging them to leave there and go to the lands of Islaam, no doubt, these are important matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelievers are in need of someone to call them, especially since Islaam in the lands of disbelief has been distorted. So many of the disbelievers don’t know anything about true Islaam because of the cover-up, and misguidance, and distortion, and deterrence, and false allegations against the religion of Islaam, that it is a religion of barbarity, and savageness and backwardness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, calling to Allaah in those lands is a matter of extreme importance because of what results because of it from benefit and guidance for the creation, in particular when sincerity, and truthfulness, and patience exists in the callers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, by Allaah’s permission, good outcomes will occur. However, it is a must that this caller to Allaah, his da’wah must have some effect and influence, and this only happens to a man who has with him knowledge and insight; a man who knows his deen with its evidences, and he has the ability to call to it and refute the specious arguments that he comes across, along with the ability to perform that which Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has made obligatory upon him, and all of this, meaning the permissibility of going there for the purpose of da’wah, is under the condition that the caller to Allaah feels safe for himself from tribulation, for if he fears tribulation for his deen, or fears for himself falling into that which Allaah has forbidden, it is not allowed for him to travel there even if it is for the purpose of da’wah.</p>

HIS LINEAGE:</span></strong> He was Aboo Muhammad, `Abdullaah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah ibn Miqdaam ibn Nasr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Hudhayfah ibn Muhammad ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Qaasim ibn Ibraaheem ibn Ismaa`eel ibn Yahyaa ibn Muhammad ibn Saalim ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Umar ibn al-Khattaab-radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qurashee:</strong> He was from the tribe of Quraysh, since he was descended from `Umar-radiyallaahu `anhu &#8211; who was `Adawee (i.e. from the sub-tribe of Banoo `Adiyy who were part of Quraysh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Maqdisee:</strong> His family&#8217;s ascription to &#8216;Baytul-Maqdis&#8217; (Jerusalem) since they lived close to it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as-Saalihee:</strong> In ascription to the mosque of as-Saalihiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His brother Shaykh Aboo `Umar said: <em>&#8220;They ascribe us to &#8216;as-Saalihiyyah&#8217; because we settled at the mosque of Aboo Saalih, not that we were righteous people (saalihoon).&#8221;</em> [And this is from piety since they were indeed a family of righteousness and rectification].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Hanbalee:</strong> In ascription to the Hanbalee madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the principles and details of Fiqh followed by the students of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. [and he was not a blind follower].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2. HIS BIRTH:</span></strong> He was born in the month of Sha`baan in the year 541H in the town of Jammaa`eel.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His father:</strong> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah was born in 491H and died in 558H. [He had his son at the age of 50]. He was one of the righteous scholars; famous for knowledge, zuhd and worship. He was the Khateeb of the mosque of Jammaa`eel. He educated his children and taught them the Qur&#8217;aan, and the hadeeth, and correct manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died when Imaam Muwaffaqud-Deen was about 17 years old, so his elder son Muhammad ibn Ahmad &#8211; who was known as Aboo `Umar &#8211; continued his upbringing and education.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4. HIS EARLY YEARS, AND HIS SEEKING KNOWLEDGE, AND HIS TRAVELLING TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first ten years of his life he remained with his family in Palestine, and he began memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in 551H, when he was 10 years old, his father performed Hijrah (migration) with the family, fleeing from the invading Christians, and migrated to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Damascus he completed memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan, and he memorized a large number of ahaadeeth. Then he memorized &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217;-on the Fiqh of Imaam Ahmad. (Then later in life he wrote an explanation of it in 9 volumes, called al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Damascus for 10 years, and at the age of twenty he undertook his first journey in search of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-In 561H: he travelled to the main city of knowledge and of the scholars at that time- Baghdaad. He was accompanied by his maternal cousin al-Haafidh `Abdul-Ghanee al- Maqdisee;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He inclined towards the study of Fiqh and his cousin towards hadeeth, however they accompanied each other to the lectures and acquired both;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There he studied with many of the scholars, amongst them: Shaykh `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (D. 561H), Ibnul-Battee, and Ibnul-Manniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Baghdaad for four years. He studied &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217; under `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee, and then the Shaykh died 50 nights after his arrival; then they studied under Ibnul-Jawzee; then he remained with Ibnul-Manniyy, and learned the Fiqh of the Hanbalee madhhab with him, and its principles, and the different sayings of the scholars- and he excelled in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then returned to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 567H he again travelled to Baghdaad where he remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 573H he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj, and he met the people of knowledge there; amongst them al-Mubaarak ibn at-Tabbaakh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after performing Hajj in 574: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Makkah he travelled to Baghdaad &#8211; where he again remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Baghdaad he returned to Damascus where he started to write works on many branches of knowledge, the most famous of his works being &#8216;al-Mughnee.&#8217;</p>

8. Shaykh Badr ibn `Abdillaah al-Badr (hafidahullaah) in his introduction to his checking of Ibn Qudaamah&#8217;s book &#8216;Ithbaat Sifaat-`Uluww&#8217; gathers a list of his Shaykhs numbering 67, and then said: &#8220;and many others besides them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6. HIS STUDENTS: </span></strong>Amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. al-Bahaa.ul-Maqdisee (d. 624H) who wrote &#8216;al-`Uddah Sharh al-`Umdah.&#8217;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7. HIS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERISTICS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His student ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was of full height, white, with a bright face, large distinct eyes; he was so handsome that it was as if his face was radiating light; he had a broad forehead and a long beard; a straight nose and his eyebrows joined. He had a small head, slender arms and legs; and a thin body; and full senses and faculties. He was extremely intelligent; and behaved in a fine manner&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Najjaar said: &#8220;al-Muwaffaq was the Imaam of the Hanbalees in the main congregational mosque of Damascus. He was fully reliable, an evidence (in narrating), noble. He had plentiful virtues; and he kept away from anything not befitting; he was pious, a worshipper.He was upon the way of the Salaf. Light and dignity could be seen upon him. A man would take benefit from seeing him even before hearing his speech.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;He used to engage in optional prayers between the two night prayers (i.e. Maghrib and `Ishaa.) close to his place of prayer. Then when he had prayed the `Ishaa. prayer he would return to his house of the street of ad-Duwalla`ee by the bank of the river. He would take back with him those he could from the poor and needy, and they would eat with him, and his primary house was upon Qaasiyyoon&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He was fine in his manners: he would hardly ever be seen except that he was smiling. He would relate incidents and joke. I heard al-Bahaa. say; When the people read with him he would joke with us, and be cheerful and at ease. Once they complained to him about some children who studied with him, so he said; &#8220;They are children. They have to have some play, and you used to be just like them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bahaa. described him as being courageous, and said: &#8220;He used to go forward to the enemy, and he was wounded upon his hand; and he used to take part when the army and the enemy were firing at each other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He used to pray with &#8216;Khushoo`&#8217; (humility and attentiveness). He would hardly ever pray the Sunnah prayer before Fajr and after `Ishaa. except in his house; and between the two night prayers he used to pray four rak`ahs, reciting: &#8216;as-Sajdah,&#8217; &#8216;Yaaseen,&#8217; &#8216;ad-Dukhaan,&#8217; and &#8216;Tabaarak.&#8217; He would hardly miss out on them. He used to stand in prayer in the last hours of the night reciting 1/7th of the Qur&#8217;aan. He would sometimes raise his voice and he had a beautiful voice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">8. SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE OF HIM:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The very scholar of hadeeth, Aboo `Amr ibn as-Salaah said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Bakr ibn Ghaneemah &#8211; the muftee of Baghdaad &#8211; said: &#8220;I do not know anyone in our time who has reached the level of ijtihaad except for al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sibt ibn al-Jawzee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam in many fields. After his brother Aboo `Umar and al-`Imaad, there was no one in his time who had greater &#8216;zuhd&#8217; or piety than him. He had a great deal of &#8216;hayaa.&#8217; (sense of shame), and he remained aloof from this world and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was easy and mild-mannered, humble, and he had love for the poor. He was fine in manners, generous and giving, whoever saw him then it was as if he had seen one of the Companions; and it was as if light came from his face. He was plentiful in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said: &#8220;After al-Awzaa`ee no one entered Shaam having more Fiqh knowledge and understanding of the religion than al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam with regard to the Qur&#8217;aan and its explanation; an Imaam in the knowledge of hadeeth and its problematic matters; an Imaam in Fiqh &#8211; indeed the outstanding scholar of his time in that; an Imaam of knowledge of the disagreements of scholars; the outstanding scholar of his time in Laws of Inheritance; an Imaam in Usoolul-Fiqh; an Imaam in Arabic Grammar; an Imaam in mathematics; an Imaam in the movements and positions of stars and planets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee said: &#8220;The Faqeeh, the Zaahid, the Imaam. Shaykhul-Islaam. The singular exception scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh ibn Katheer said: &#8220;Shaykhul-Islaam. An Imaam. An outstanding scholar. There was not in his time, indeed even for a long time before him, anyone having greater knowledge of Fiqh than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said: &#8220;He used to closely follow the texts in the matter of al-Usool (fundamentals and belief) and in other than it. He did not hold applying any acts of worship for which there was no narration. He used to order affirmation of the texts, and leaving them as they are &#8211; with regard to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from &#8216;as-Sifaat&#8217; (Allaah&#8217;s Attributes): Not altering them, not declaring how they are, not distorting the meaning; not interpreting them away with &#8216;ta&#8217;weel,&#8217; and not negating them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">9. HIS DEATH:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died (rahimahullaah) on Saturday, the day of `Eidul-Fitr, in 620H, at the age of 79 in his home in Damascus. His funeral which had a huge attendance was held the next day and he was buried on the hill of Qaasiyyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">10. HIS WIFE, SLAVE-GIRLS AND CHILDREN:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married his paternal cousin Maryam bint Abee Bakr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Sa`d al-Maqdisee. They had a number of children: (al-Majd) `Eesaa, Muhammad, Yahyaa, Safiyyah, and Faatimah. Then he took a slave girl, and then another. Then he married `Izziyyah- who died before him. All his sons died in his lifetime, and none of them had offspring except for `Eesaa- who had two righteous sons, however both of them died without any offspring. So the Shaykh had no remaining progeny.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">11. HIS WORKS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. `Alee ibn Sa`eed al-Ghaamidee lists his work and they come to 38 in number.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 80</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that heresy, disbelief, doubts, innovations, misguidance and confusion about the religion have not occurred except through rhetorical theology (<em>al-kalaam)</em> and the people of rhetorical theology and through argumentation, debating, disputing and self-amazement. And how can a man boldly enter into debating, disputing and argumentation when Allaah, the Most High says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of this has preceded and a warning against it.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So what is upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and remain silent.”</span> </strong>Upon you is to submit to the speech of Allaah and to the speech of His Messenger and to withhold from argumentation and raising doubts because that is prohibited. Indeed it will increase confusion. Take hold of the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger and be satisfied with that so that you are guided and therefore be at peace from whisperings, doubts and false ideas and you will come to be upon clear insight. So Allaah sent down this Qur&#8217;aan as a clarification of everything.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) then <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to the meaning of <em>kalaam</em>; it means logic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Page 125, for this 1<sup>st</sup> volume, point number 11.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to these Points at the below Links:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Point 10:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs/">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs</a></p>
<p><strong>Point 11: </strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-is-an-innovation-and-misguidance/">Speculative speech (kalaam) about Allaah, the Most High, is an innovation and misguidance</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: Explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: The author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that there has not been any heresy or any disbelief,”</strong></span> I say, “Restricting heresy to be a result of <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and to the people of rhetorical theology and to the people of disputing and argumentation, this refers to what’s mostly the case. However, indeed there are cases of heresy and disbelief, which come about for other reasons besides <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology). And we seek Allaah’s refuge from all the causes of heresy and disbelief and doubts and innovations, Aameen. However, this is what is generally the case with regard to a person who learns <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and those who learn the different forms of debating and argumentation and self-amazement. And what is obligatory is to not be amazed at one’s self. And a person’s being outstanding in debating and argumentation is something which is blameworthy in the legislation unless it is to make the truth clear. And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth from the a<u>h</u>aadeeth of `Aa`ishah<em> ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The most hated of men to Allaah is the argumentative quarrelsome person.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (2457) and Muslim (2668).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the narration of At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah hates that person who is very eloquent from the men, the one who moves his tongue around just as the cows move their tongues around.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmi<u>th</u>ee (2,853) and declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the author<em> ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">How can a person be bold upon argumentation and disputing</span></strong> when Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None dispute regarding the aayaat of Allaah except those who disbelieve.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah-Ghaafir (40), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah 4</em><span style="font-size:1rem;">)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and be silent.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I say &#8211; what is befitting for the Muslim is to submit to whatever comes from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and to withhold and be silent whatever is besides that knowing that submission to what occurs from the bringer of the legislation <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> should be a submission of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em> (being pleased and satisfied) and based upon acceptance and <em>eemaan</em> and attesting to the truth, acting upon whatever requires action from it and believing whatever it necessitates that we believe in. Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By time, mankind is in loss except those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) and work righteous and correct deeds and they encourage each other with the truth and they encourage each other with patience.</span> </strong><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Asr, </span><em style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;"> 1-3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of `<strong><em>aamanoo</em> </strong>is <strong><em><u>s</u>addaqoo</em></strong>: they believe and attest to the truth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>PURIFICATION FOR THE PRAYER (AT-TAHAARAH LISSALAAT):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Umar &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; who said: I heard the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) say: &lt;&lt;<strong>Prayer will not be accepted without purification</strong>.&gt;&gt; <sup>[<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"><strong>01</strong></a>]</sup></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Contents:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wudoo : It&#8217;s Description</li>
<li>The Conditions (Shuroot) of Wudoo for Its Correctness</li>
<li>Obligations (Faraa’id) of Wudoo</li>
<li>Sunnahs of Wudoo</li>
<li>The Things Which Nullify the Wudoo</li>
<li>That Which the Wudoo Is Obligatory for (What Is Forbidden for the Person Whose State of Purification Is Broken)</li>
<li>That Which the Wudoo Is Recommended For</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE WUDOO·:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Its description:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Humraan-the mawlaa (freed-slave) of `Uthmaan: that `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; called for some water for wudoo and he performed the wudoo .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he washed his hands three times; then he washed his mouth and washed out his nose; then he washed his face three times; then he washed his right arm up to and including the elbow three times; then he washed his left arm likewise; then he wiped his head; then he washed his right foot up to and including the ankle three times; then he washed the left one likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: “I saw Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo with the like of this wudoo of mine. Then Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:<span style="color:#808000;">”<strong>Whoever performs wudoo like this wudoo of mine, and he prays two rak`ahs-not conversing with himself in them, then his previous sins will be forgiven for him.</strong>””</span> Ibn Shihaab said: “Our scholars used to say: This wudoo is the most complete wudoo which anyone can make for the Prayer.” <sup>[<a href="#fn2" name="fnref2">02</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE CONDITIONS (SHUROOT) FOR ITS CORRECTNESS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1- The intention (an-Niyyah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>Actions are but by intentions</strong>”</span>, <sup>[<a href="#fn3" name="fnref3">03</a>]</sup> and it is not legislated to utter it in words, since it is not established from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- Mentioning Allaah’s name (at-Tasmiyah):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>There is no Prayer for the one who does not have wudoo, and there is no wudoo· for the one who does not mention Allaah’s name upon it</strong>.”</span> <sup>[<a href="#fn4" name="fnref4">04</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- Continuity (al-Muwaalaat):</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn5" name="fnref5">05</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Khaalid ibn Ma`daan: [from one of the Companions of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw a man praying with a dry spot the size of a dirham, which water had not touched. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) ordered him to repeat the wudoo· and the Prayer</span>.</strong> <sup>[<a href="#fn6" name="fnref6">06</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ITS OBLIGATIONS (FARAA&#8217;ID):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Washing the face, and from it is washing the mouth (al-Madmadah) and washing out the nose (al-Istinshaaq).<br />
2- Washing the two arms up to the elbows.<sup>[<a href="#fn7" name="fnref7">07</a>]</sup><br />
3- Wiping the whole of the head; and the ears are from the head.<br />
4- Washing the feet up to and including the ankles: because of His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>..and your feet up to and including the ankles</strong></span>].<br />
[Sooratul-Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: O you who believe! When you stand to pray, wash your faces and your arms up to and including the elbows, and wipe your heads,]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the washing of the mouth (al-Madmadah) and the washing out of the nose (alIstinshaaq) being from the face, such that they are obligatory, then this is because Allaah -the Perfect- commanded the washing of the face in His Mighty Book; and it is established that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) continually practised that in every wudoo, and it was reported by all those who reported his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wudoo· and explained its description. So this shows that the washing of the face which has been commanded in the Qur&#8217;aan includes washing the mouth and washing out the nose. <sup>[<a href="#fn8" name="fnref8">08</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs a command for the two of them in his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you performs wudoo, then let him put water into his nose and then let him blow it out.”</strong></span>,<sup>[<a href="#fn9" name="fnref9">09</a>]</sup> <span style="font-size:1rem;">and his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: </span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">“Exert in sniffing water into the nose, unless you are fasting”</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">,<sup>[<a href="#fn10" name="fnref10">10</a>]</sup> and his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: </span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">“When you perform wudoo, then wash your mouth.”</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;"> <sup>[<a href="#fn11" name="fnref11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obligation of wiping over the whole of the head, then this is because the command in the Qur&#8217;aan to wipe is left unspecified (<em>mujmal</em>). So the Sunnah is referred to for its clarification, and it is established in the two Saheehs and elsewhere that <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wiped the whole of his head</strong></span>. So this contains a proof that it is obligatory to wipe the head completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then if it is said: It is established from a hadeeth of al-Mugheerah that the <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wiped over his forelock and upon his turban (`<em>imaamah</em>)</strong></span>, then the response is: he only restricted himself to wiping the forelock because he completed the rest of the wiping of the head upon the turban, and we hold this as our saying; and there is no proof in it for the permissibility of limiting the wiping to the forelock, or to a part of the head, without completing it upon the turban.<sup>[<a href="#fn12" name="fnref12">12</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary it is obligatory to wipe the whole of the head; and the person who wipes may wipe upon the head only, or upon the turban only, or upon the head and turban. All of this is authentic and established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two ears being from the head, such that it is obligatory to wipe them, then it is because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The two ears are from the head.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn13" name="fnref13">13</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- Rubbing the wetted fingers through the beard:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>he used to take a handful of water and enter it under his chin, and he would rub it through his beard, and say “This is what my Lord -the Mighty and Majestic- has commanded.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn14" name="fnref14">14</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- Entering the wet fingers between the fingers and toes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Complete the wudoo·, and rub between the fingers and toes, and exert in entering water into the nose unless you are fasting.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn15" name="fnref15">15</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ITS SUNNAHS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- The siwaak (tooth-stick):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If it were not that I would make a difficulty upon my nation I would have commanded them to use the siwaak with every wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn16" name="fnref16">16</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- Washing the hands three times at the beginning of the wudoo·:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what is established from `Uthmaan -radiyallaahu `anhu, that when he showed how the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo·, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>he washed his hands three times</strong>.</span><sup>[<a href="#fn17" name="fnref17">17</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- Combining the washing of the mouth and the washing of the nose</strong> three times, each with a single handful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what occurs in the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Zayd -radiyallaahu `anhu when he taught the people how Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed the wudoo·: that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">he washed his mouth and washed his nose from a single handful, and he did that three times</span></strong>.<sup>[<a href="#fn18" name="fnref18">18</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Exerting in these two, for the one who is not fasting:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Exert in sniffing water into the nose, unless you are fasting.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn19" name="fnref19">19</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5- Giving precedence to the right side over the left side:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>-: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to like to begin with the right side, when putting on shoes, and when combing his hair, and in his purification, and in all his affairs.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn20" name="fnref20">20</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of what occurs in the hadeeth of `Uthmaan, when he showed how the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo·: that he washed the right side and then the left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6- Rubbing (water upon the body parts):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Zayd: that two thirds of a handful of water was brought to the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) <strong><span style="color:#808000;">so he rubbed his forearms</span></strong>.<sup>[<a href="#fn21" name="fnref21">21</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7- Washing three times:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Uthmaan: that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed the wudoo, washing each part three times; and it is authentic that he (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo· washing each part once; and washing each part twice. <sup>[<a href="#fn22" name="fnref22">22</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is recommended to repeat the wiping of the head sometimes: because of what is authentic from `Uthmaan that he performed wudoo·, and he wiped his head three times, and he said: “I saw Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo· like this.”<sup>[<a href="#fn23" name="fnref23">23</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8- (Keeping to) the order (at-Tarteeb):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this was what Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) generally did, as is reported by those who reported his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it is authentic from al-Miqdaam ibn Ma`deekarib: “That he brought some water for wudoo· for Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) So he performed wudoo·, and he washed his hands three times, and he washed his face three times; then he washed his forearms three times; then he washed his mouth and washed out his nose three times; then he wiped his head and his ears…”, the hadeeth.<sup>[<a href="#fn24" name="fnref24">24</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9- Making supplication (du`aa·) after it:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There is not one of you who performs wudoo·, and completes the wudoo·, and then says:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illallaah, wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasooluhu) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger’, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">except that the eight gates of Paradise are opened for him: he may enter through whichever of them he pleases.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn25" name="fnref25">25</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tirmidhee added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>(Allaahummaj `alnee minat-Tawwaabeena waj`alnee minal- Mutatahhireen) </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘O Allaah! Make me from those who constantly repent, and make me from those who purify themselves.’</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn26" name="fnref26">26</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Sa`eed that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever performs wudoo· and says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>سبْحانَك اللَّهُمّ وبحَمْدكَ أشْهدُ أنْ لا إله إلا أنْت أسْتغْفِركَ وَأتَوبُ إليْك</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>(Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika, ashhadu an laa ilaaha illaa Anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘ I declare You free of all imperfections, and all praise is for You. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but you. I seek Your forgiveness, and I turn in repentance to You’,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>then it is written upon a parchment, then it is sealed with a seal, and it is not broken until the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn27" name="fnref27">27</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10- Praying the two rak`ahs after it &#8211; because of the saying of `Uthmaan, after he taught them the description of the wudoo· of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I saw the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo· with the like of this wudoo·, and the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Whoever performs wudoo· with the like of this wudoo·; then he stands and prays two rak`ahs, not conversing with himself in them, then his previous sins are forgiven.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn28" name="fnref28">28</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Hurayrah: that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said to Bilaal, at the time of the Dawn Prayer: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O Bilaal! Tell me about the action which you have done in Islaam which gives you the most hope, for I have heard your footsteps in front of me in Paradise.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I have not done any action which gives me greater hope than the fact that I have never purified myself at any hour of the night or the day except that I prayer what was written for me to pray with that purification.”<sup>[<a href="#fn29" name="fnref29">29</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE THINGS WHICH NULLIFY THE WUDOO·:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. That which comes out of the two pathways (the genitals and the anus) from excrement, urine, and wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or if one of you comes from the toilet</strong></span>]],<br />
[Sooratul-Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and it is an expression which means relieving oneself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to the saying of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Allaah will not accept the Prayer of any one of you who breaks his purification until he performs wudoo·.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a man from Hadramawt said: “What is ‘breaking purification’ (hadath), O Aboo Hurayrah?’’ He said: “Breaking wind noiselessly or with a sound.’’<sup>[<a href="#fn30" name="fnref30">30</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is likewise nullified by discharge of pre-seminal fluid (al-Madhee) and al-Wadee.<sup>[<a href="#fn31" name="fnref31">31</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhu)maa- who said: “<strong>al-Manee</strong>, and <strong>al-Wadee</strong> and <strong>al-Madhee</strong>. As for al-Manee (semen) then it is that which necessitates taking a bath (ghusl). As for ‘al-Wadee’ and al-Madhee (pre-seminal fluid), then he said: Wash your penis, or the parts of your penis, and perform the wudoo as you would do for the Prayer.’’ <sup>[<a href="#fn32" name="fnref32">32</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Sleep which overwhelms, such that no consciousness remains with him, whether he is sitting with his buttocks firmly on the ground or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn `Assaal who said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to command us that when we were on a journey that we should not take off our leather socks for three days along with their nights, except from janaabah. <sup>[<a href="#fn33" name="fnref33">33</a>]</sup> However from excrement, and urine, and sleep.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn34" name="fnref34">34</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) equated sleep with urinating and voiding excrement. From `Alee <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The eye is the tying string (wikaa·) for the anus (as-Sah), so whoever sleeps then let him perform wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn35" name="fnref35">35</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wikaa·, with a kasrah on the waaw, is the string which is used to tie a leather bag.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sah, with a fathah on the seen -which is without dots, and with a kasrah on the haah -which is without shaddah is the anus. And the meaning is that being awake is the tying-string for the anus, i.e. guarding that which is contained within it from coming out, since as long as he is awake he will feel that which comes out from it. <sup>[<a href="#fn36" name="fnref36">36</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Loss of consciousness through intoxication or illness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because unconsciousness through these causes is more profound than when it results from sleep.<sup>[<a href="#fn37" name="fnref37">37</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Touching the uncovered genitals, if it is done with desire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever touches his penis, then let him perform wudoo·”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn38" name="fnref38">38</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Is it not except a part of you.”</strong> </span><sup>[<a href="#fn39" name="fnref39">39</a>]</sup> So it is just a part of you if there is no desire attached to the touching, because in this condition it is possible to see the resemblance of touching that part with touching any other part of the body. Contrary to when he touches it with desire, for then touching it will not resemble touching any other part, because that will not normally be connected to desire. And this matter is clear, as you can see.<sup>[<a href="#fn40" name="fnref40">40</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Eating camel meat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the hadeeth of al-Baraa· ibn `Aazib -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Perform wudoo· from camel meat, and do not perform wudoo· from meat of sheep.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn41" name="fnref41">41</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Jaabir ibn Samurah<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> : That a man asked the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) Should I perform wudoo· from eating the meat of sheep?” He said: “If you wish then perform wudoo·, and if you wish then don’t perform wudoo·.” He said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Should I perform wudoo· from the meat of camels. He said: “ Yes, perform wudoo· from the meat of camels.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn42" name="fnref42">42</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THAT WHICH THE WUDOO· IS OBLIGATORY FOR (WHAT IS FORBIDDEN FOR THE PERSON WHOSE STATE OF PURIFICATION IS BROKEN):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. The Prayer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of His Saying, He -the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! When you stand up intending to pray, then wash your faces…</strong></span>]], the Aayah. [Sooratul Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the saying of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">Allaah will not accept a Prayer without Purification.”</span> </strong><sup>[<a href="#fn43" name="fnref43">43</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. Performing Tawaaf around the House:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tawaaf around the House is Prayer, except that Allaah has made speech permissible in it.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn44" name="fnref44">44</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THAT WHICH THE WUDOO· IS RECOMMENDED FOR:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. The remembrance of Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of al-Muhaajir ibn Qunfudh, that he gave the greeting of Salaam to the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) whilst he was urinating, and he did not respond to him until he had performed wudoo·. Then he responded to him, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I was not prevented from responding to you except by the fact that I disliked to make mention of Allaah except upon purification..”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn45" name="fnref45">45</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2. Sleep:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what al-Baraa· ibn Aazib -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- said: The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you go to your bed then perform wudoo as you would perform wudoo· for the prayer. Then lie down upon your right-hand side, then say: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O Allaah I have submitted my soul to You, and I have turned my face to You, and I have entrusted my affair to You, and I have placed my dependence upon You, hoping and having fear in You. There is no shelter and no place of safety from You except towards You. O Allaah, I believe in Your Book which You sent down and in Your Prophet who You sent.” </strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So if you die on that night of yours , then you will be upon the fitrah (the true Religion), and make them the last things you speak with.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn46" name="fnref46">46</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. The Junub (The person who is in a state of Janaabah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wants to eat or drink or sleep or repeat the act of intercourse: From `Aa·ishah- radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) when he was junub, and he wanted to eat or sleep, would perform wudoo· in the way in which he performed wudoo· for the Prayer.</span> </strong><sup>[<a href="#fn47" name="fnref47">47</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Ammaar ibn Yaasir -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) gave concession for the junub, when he wanted to eat or drink or sleep, that he could perform wudoo· in the manner in which he performs wudoo· for the Prayer.<sup>[<a href="#fn48" name="fnref48">48</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Sa`eed<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When one of you has relations with his wife and then he wants to repeat, then let him perform wudoo·.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn49" name="fnref49">49</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4. Before taking a ghusl (bath),</span></strong> whether it is one which is obligatory or one which is recommended:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah- radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘‘When Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to take a bath from janaabah he would begin with washing his hands. Then he would pour water with his right hand over his left hand and wash his genitals, then he would perform wudoo· in the manner in which he performed wudoo· for the Prayer.’</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn50" name="fnref50">50</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Eating that which has been touched by fire</strong></span> (eating cooked food):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: I heard Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Perform wudoo· from that which has been touched by fire.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn51" name="fnref51">51</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is taken to be a recommendation because of the hadeeth of `Ammaar ibn `Umayyah ad-Damree who said: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">I saw the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) cutting some meat from the shoulder of a sheep and he ate from it, then he was called to the Prayer. So he got up, and threw down the knife, and prayed and he did not perform wudoo·.</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn52" name="fnref52">52</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. For every Prayer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Buraydah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to perform wudoo· for every Prayer. Then, when it was the Day of the Conquest, he performed wudoo·, and he wiped over his leather socks, and he prayed the Prayers with a single wudoo·.</strong> </span>So `Umar said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! You have done something which you had not used to do.” So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“ I did it deliberately, O `Umar.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn53" name="fnref53">53</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Every time that purification is broken:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Buraydah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) entered the morning one day, and he called for Bilaal, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“O Bilaal on account of what have you preceded me in Paradise? Last night I entered Paradise and I heard the sound of your footsteps in front of me.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bilaal said: “O Messenger of Allaah! I have never given the adhaan except that I prayed two rak`ahs; and my purification was never broken except that I then performed wudoo·. So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Because of this.”<sup>[<a href="#fn54" name="fnref54">54</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. From vomiting:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Ma`daan ibn Abee Talhah: from Abud-Dardaa·: that <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) vomited, so he broke his fast, and he performed wudoo</strong></span>·. He said: So I met Thawbaan in the mosque of Damascus, and I mentioned that to him. So he said: ‘He has spoken the truth. I poured the water out for him to make wudoo·.’<sup>[<a href="#fn55" name="fnref55">55</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">9. Whoever carries a dead person:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> “Whoever washes a dead person, then let him take a bath; and whoever carries him, then let him perform wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn56" name="fnref56">56</a>]</sup></p>

However we do not say that because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Abbaas that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “You do not have to take the bath for washing your dead, when you have washed him; for your dead person is not impure. So it is sufficient for you to wash your hands.” It was reported by al-Haakim (1/386), and al-Bayhaqee (3/398). Slightly adapted from ‘Ahkaamul-Janaa·iz’ of al-Albaanee (p. 53)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 79</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the first ones who will see Allaah, the Most High, in Paradise are the blind then the men then the women with the eyes of their heads just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “You shall certainly see your Lord just as you see the moon on the night when it is full. You will not have any difficulty in seeing Him. It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in this and denying it is disbelief.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of affirmation of <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah, the Most High, in the Hereafter) has <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><strong>preceded</strong> </a>and this is re-emphasis of what has preceded and as for this order, which the author mentioned then it needs a proof. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Listen/Read @<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><br />
<strong>The true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> The <u>h</u>adeeth in that regard that we had before in the book with regard to seeing Allaah, the Most High in the Hereafter, not with regard to the order is the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (554) and Muslim (633).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on this specific point, the point of this order that those who will see Allaah first are the blind then the men then the women, the one doing the footnotes in one of the versions Khaalid ar-Raddaadi, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There occurs in this regard a <u>h</u>adeeth which is traced back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it is not authentic. It was mentioned by Ad-Dailamee in his book <em>Firdaws ul-Akhbaar</em> from Samurah ibn Jundub from him tracing back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it’s not authentic. And also al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>As-Sunnah</em> quoted this with a weak chain of narration as being the saying of Al-Hasan al-Basree; the Taabi`ee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in explanation of this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made clear that <strong>whoever denies seeing the Creator has disbelieved</strong>. This ruling is a general ruling because whoever denies a matter which is known necessarily from the religion then he’s a disbeliever. As for the person who is overcome by a false doubt (<em>shubhah)</em> and he doesn’t know how to resolve this doubt or he resolves it with a mistake then this is a different matter. Those matters that a person does based upon a false doubt that comes upon him and is not able to arrive at what is correct in the matter then we leave his affair to Allaah. However, if he is a person who knowingly denies these matters then he has disbelieved.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 78</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that there are three forms of address for the tidings that are given when one dies.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> It may be said, <em><span style="color:#800000;">“Receive good tidings O beloved one of Allaah, of Allaah’s pleasure and of Paradise”</span></em> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive good tidings O servant of Allaah of Paradise on account of Islaam”</em></span> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive tidings O enemy of Allaah, of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire.” </em></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This was the saying of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F383901782&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is dying whether he is a believer or a disbeliever, will be given tidings at the point of death. So, if he is a believer, he will be given good tidings of Allaah’s mercy and of Paradise. And if he is a disbeliever, he will be given tidings of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire. So, he will not actually die till he knows where he will be and it will not be possible for him to repent or to free himself or to increase in righteous deeds. This is what occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever loves to meet Allaah then Allaah will love to meet him.” So `A`ishah said, “Oh Messenger of Allaah, all of us dislike death.” Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “That is not the case, O `A`ishah but rather the believer at the point of death will be given good tidings and so therefore, he will love to meet Allaah and so Allaah will love to meet him. Whereas, the disbeliever will be given tidings of the Fire so therefore, he will hate the meeting with Allaah so Allaah will hate to meet him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” and then they remain upright then there will be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah</em> 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” then they remained upright then the angels will descend upon them saying, “Fear not and do not grieve and receive glad tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.”</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah</em> 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۙ الْمَلَائِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَارَهُمْ وَذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers striking their faces and their backs saying, “Taste the punishment of the Blazing Fire.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 77</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Allaah, the Exalted and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows. His two Hands are outstretched. He knew that the creation would disobey Him before He created them. His Knowledge takes effect upon them, however, His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam. He favoured them with it out of His Generosity, Munificence and Favour so all praise is for Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F383448971&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/affirmation-of-attributes-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And Allaah, the Perfect and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows.”</span> </strong>This is the third type from the types of Tawheed; to affirm <em>Al-Asma Wa-<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (Names and Attributes) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, just as they occur in the Book and the Sunnah, along with believing in their meanings and whatever they indicate and not entering into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how they are) because how they are is not known except to Allaah but as for their meaning then it is something known. So, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them and to hold as your creed what they indicate just as Imaam Maalik said, “Allaah, the Most High ascended over His Throne.” The ascending is something known. Known in its meaning and how is unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“He knew that the creation were going to disobey Him even before He created them.”</span> </strong>Allaah has knowledge of everything. He knew what was going to occur &#8211; from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and from obedience and from disobedience; nothing is hidden from Him. He knew it before He created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam.” </strong></span>Even though He knew what they would commit from disbelief and from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then Allaah called them to Islaam and He called them to true faith; <em>eemaan</em> and He sent the Messengers and He sent down the Books for their guidance and He knew what they would do. However, from His mercy, He did not just leave them and entrust them to His Knowledge about them. Rather, He established the proof upon them and He gave them <em>ikhtiyaar</em> (choice) and <em>mashee&#8217;ah</em> (will) and <em>qudrah</em> (ability). So, they are able to act. So, if they leave action then the sin is their sin and the shortcoming is their shortcoming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, guides all of the creation; the believers and the disbelievers. With the meaning that He makes the affair clear to all of them. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">As for Thamood then We showed them the way ..</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Fu<u>ss</u>ilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We guided them, showed them the way: </strong>meaning, We made it clear to them and directed them towards it. However, they did not accept this. They obstinately rejected and were haughty.</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَىٰ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَاعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. However, they loved blind error over and above guidance so the awful blast of humiliating torment seized them on account of the sins that they used to earn.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, on account of what they earned and it was not just because Allaah knew that and decreed it for them but rather because of what they actually earned by their choice and their will and their action. So, guidance; <strong><em>hidaayah</em> </strong>is of two kinds:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Hidaayatul Irshaad</strong> (the guidance of giving direction) and this is general to the believer and the disbeliever,</li>
<li><strong>Hidaayatut-Tawfeeq</strong> (the guidance of being granted the success of accepting that guidance). This is specific to the believers, those who accepted the guidance of Allaah and His direction. So, Allaah grants them the success of its attainment and He makes them firm.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So He guided them towards Islaam. And He favoured them with it from His Generosity and His Munificence and His Favour. So all praise is for Him.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From His Generosity,” </strong>meaning that He called them and made clear to them and clarified to them from His Generosity and He bestowed favour because of their need of that. And as for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, then He has no need at all of them whether they disbelieve or whether they believe, whether they obey or whether they disobey, they will not harm Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, nor will they benefit Him because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (independent), He has no need at all of them and this, its benefit or harm only rebounds upon them. So from His mercy upon them, He made clear to them the way of good and the way of evil, and He gave them strength and He gave them ability, and He gave them intellects with which they could distinguish between what harms and what benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> Restricting hijrah to certain lands from the lands of Islaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Some brothers, ash-Shaytaan has deceived them, they only see hijrah to be to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or they only wish to make hijrah to it despite the well-known hardship it takes to do that, so what is your advice to these people?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we advise our brothers with is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and that they rush to flee with their deen from the tribulations. No doubt, Saudi Arabia is from the best lands of Islaam due to the much good there, and the existence of the Scholars and the scarceness of open abominations, however, it is a mistake for the Muslim to delay leaving the land of disbelief and delay escaping with his deen with the argument that he is still proceeding and following up so he can enter Saudi Arabia and reside there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This excuse is not accepted because the lands of Islaam in which evil is scarce and less intense in comparison to the other lands of disbelief, no doubt, these Islaamic lands are wide, and vast and many, and Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ أَرْضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O My slaves who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> &#8211; [Al-Ankaboot (29):56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ They (angels) say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination!”</span></strong> &#8211; [An Nisaa (4):97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to, first and foremost, rush to leave the lands of disbelief to go to the lands of Islaam that are easy to get to, then after that it is alright for him to strive to take permanent residence in the best of places and the one that has the less evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi Arabia has much good in it, and likewise Yemen, especially in its rural areas and villages, there is much good. Also, the other Islaamic countries, despite the great affliction that exists in them, there is no doubt that there is no comparison between them and the other countries of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So it is upon the Muslim to rush to escape with his deen, for today he has the correct intention and is eager but what will make him realize that perhaps afterwards he will slacken in this determination even if entering Saudi Arabia became possible for him, for the hearts are between two fingers from the fingers of Ar-Rahmaan (The Most Merciful).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does the person over there feel safe for himself that he will stay upon what he is on until the next morning? Today he is healthy but what will make him realize that perhaps something will happen to him tomorrow. Today he possesses some money to help him make hijrah and travel but what will make him realize how his situation will be days after. Today he is able to travel to many of the lands of Islaam without any obstacles but he does not know what will happen to him days later. So Rush! Rush! Escape! Escape! Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“So hasten towards all that is good.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):148</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Hasten to do good deeds before the occurrence of tribulations that are like the parts of the dark night; a man will enter the morning as a believer then enter the evening as a disbeliever, or he will enter the evening as a believer then enter the morning as a disbeliever, he will sell his deen for a commodity of the dunyaa.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imaam) Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what we advise our brothers with, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/ad-deenu-an-naseehah-the-religion-is-sincerity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in disconnected form; meaning in a chapter heading, you’ll find it there in the <em>Book of Eemaan</em>; the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, chapter 42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s reported in connected form by Imaam Muslim (55) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Tameem ad-Daari <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Imaam Muslim does not have the repetition of his saying (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)…</span><strong>”. </strong>Meaning; there in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, it only occurs once that he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)</span>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, likewise, declared it with the addition there as being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Muslim (101) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and also reported by Muslim (102 ) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives then he is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 1<sup>st</sup> wording in Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2<sup>nd</sup> wording reported by Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to this first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong> </strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (the religion is sincerity) and then when they asked, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “firstly, lillaah (towards Allaah).”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “By obedience to Him and not disobeying Him and by implementing `<em>Uboodiyyalahum</em> (servitude towards Him) and by establishing His Tawheed with regard to His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and with regard to His `<em>Uloohiyyah</em> (His sole right to all worship) and with regard to His names and attributes and that you seek by performance of your deeds His face &amp; that you are sincere in your deeds, which you carry out.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Points 75</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And you should know that Allaah has favoured some of the servants over others in this world and in the Hereafter, He has done so justly. It cannot be said that He acted unjustly or has shown undue favour. Whoever says that Allaah has favoured the true believer and the disbeliever equally then he is a person upon innovation. Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever, the obedient one over the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the one who is humiliated; doing so justly. It is His favour, which He bestows upon whomever He wishes and withholds from whomever He wishes.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-has-favoured-some-of-the-servants-over-others-he-has-done-so-justly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah has favoured the servants; some of them over others in this world and in the Hereafter,”</strong></span> Allaah has favoured some of the people over others. He has bestowed favour upon the believer over the disbeliever with that which Allaah has given him from <em>eemaan</em> on account of his having <em>eemaan</em> and He withheld from the disbeliever on account of his disbelief. And Allaah favoured the believers, some over others and the Messengers (the <em>Rusul); </em>Allaah favoured some of them over others.</p>
<p><strong>تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those Messengers, We favoured some of them over others.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favor/bounty) of Allaah, which He gives to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High and no-one may raise any objection to Allaah because this is His <em>mulk</em> (kingdom), that which belongs to Him, He, the Perfect, He can give it to whomever He wishes. So, the kingdom belongs to Him, He can give it to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect. And the favour that is bestowed is His favour, He may give it to whomever He wishes. So, there could be no objection raised against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>; this deviant sect, they say, “<em>It is obligatory that Allaah treats the people equally and gives them all the same</em>.” This is to show evil manners towards Allaah and is to raise objections against Him, High and Tremendously Exalted is Allaah above that which they say. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, bestows favour on some of His creation over and above others and this is His kingdom, it belongs to Him so there can be no objection to Him. He does not punish anyone except for a crime that He has actually committed since to do so would contradict justice and Allaah does not oppress. So, He does not punish anyone without his having committed a crime or punish anyone for somebody else’s crime.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لَا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of sin will bear the sins of another and if someone weighed down with sins were to call someone else to bear his sins for him then he will not be able to find anyone to bear any of them for him even if it be a close relative.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with regard to the aspect of <em>al-jazaa</em>· (recompense) that He gives then His recompense is <em>adl</em> (just) and as for the aspect of <em>al-a<u>t</u>aa·</em> (what He gives freely) then this is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) from him, He, the Perfect and Most High and it is not for anyone to raise any objection to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says that the favour of Allaah upon the believer and the disbeliever is just the same then he is a person of innovation.” </strong></span>This is the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say that &#8211; <em>&#8220;It is obligatory upon Allaah to make all of the people believers and that He should not make just some of them disbelievers and some of them believers. He should make all of them rich, He should make all of them scholars.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to raise an objection against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High because Allaah is <em>Hakeem</em> (All-Wise). And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of the people the same in knowledge or in riches or in reward and punishment. And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of mankind wealthy. If all of them were wealthy people then the creation would be ruined because they would not find anyone who would carry out any work and production would cease. And therefore, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has favoured some of the people over others with regard to provision. He has made this one rich and this one poor so that the creation can thrive. If they were all rich then they would not produce anything. And if they were all poor then they would not be able to work and produce. So, Allaah has caused them to vary so that the creation should operate and thrive.</p>
<p><strong>وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا سُخْرِيًّا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We raised some of them over others in levels so that some of them should employ others to work.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, some of them employ others to work for wages. So, when that happens then the creation can grow and prosper and benefits are attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever and the obedient one over the disobedient one of the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the despicable one,” </strong></span>Allaah favoured the believer over the disbeliever and He gave favour to the obedient one over the sinner; this is His justice (<em>adl</em>), He, the Perfect and His <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) so no-one may raise any objection to Him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with regard to the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after some speech, he said at the end,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore this section, this part here necessitates from us that we have the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, caused His servants to be of different levels as <strong>a favour from Him and as justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is not to be questioned about that which He does. Rather, they are to be questioned. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it cannot be said, “<em>Why did He make that one a Messenger and make that one a person who is humiliated and why did He make that one a believer who is granted success of correctness whereas He made that one a rejected one and humiliated?</em>” That should not be said. Rather, it is obligatory that we believe that Allaah is free of committing oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> and that He does whatever He wishes and He decrees whatever He wills. However, all His actions are based upon <em>hikmah</em> (wisdom) and <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) and <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and <em>adl</em> (justice). That is what is obligatory upon us to believe with regard to our Lord, the Majestic and Most High. This is the creed that is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Prophetic texts and it is that which the scholars of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> are agreed in consensus upon and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Point 74</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And intellect (<em>al-`aql)</em> is inborn. Each person is given the intellect that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, wills. They vary in degree of intellect just like a speck at different heights in the heavens. And action is required from each person in accordance with the intellect he has been given. Intellect is not earned, rather, it is a favour bestowed by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/al-aql-intellect-is-not-acquired-rather-it-is-a-fadl-favour-bestowed-by-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-`Aql </em><strong>عقل  </strong>(the intellect), it is a faculty, which Allaah places in the person by means of which he can comprehend things. By means of it, he can distinguish what is harmful from what is beneficial and what is good from what is evil. No-one knows the nature (<em>kayfiyyah)</em> of the intellect (<em>`aql)</em>. People have groped about in confusion concerning it but they have not reached a conclusion because it is one of the secrets of Allaah, which no-one knows except Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p>And the `<strong><em>aql</em>  عقل </strong>(intellect), it is called <em>`aql</em> (intellect) with an <em>`ain</em> and a <em>qaaf</em> and a <em>laam</em> because it withholds a person from that which will harm him<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> just as a tethering rope holds an animal back from escaping.</p>
<p>The intellect is also called <strong><em><u>H</u>ijr</em> </strong>(prevention).</p>
<p><strong>هَلْ فِي ذَٰلِكَ قَسَمٌ لِّذِي حِجْرٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is there not in these oaths sufficient proof for a person possessing <em><u>H</u>ijr</em> (intellect)?</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-<u>H</u>ijr</em> here is <em>Al-`Aql </em>(the intellect). It is called that because it blocks and prevents a person from that, which will harm him.</p>
<p>And it is called <strong><em>An-Nuhaa</em></strong>.<strong>النُّهَى</strong></p>
<p><strong>كُلُوا وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَامَكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِّأُولِي النُّهَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that there are clear signs for those who possess <em>Nuhaa</em> (intellect).</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa-</span><u style="font-size:1rem;">H</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the people of <em>al-`Uqool</em> (intellects).</p>
<p>And it is called <strong><em>al-Lubb</em></strong>.<em> </em><strong>لُبّ</strong></p>
<p><strong> لِّأُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the possessors of <em>al-Baab</em>.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 190)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the people with intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>`aql</em> (intellect) is from the signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“<em>Huwa mawlood</em> (it is inborn).” </strong></span>What is apparent is that he intended that it is <em>makhlooq</em> (something created) and that it is not something that is ancient or pre-existing or that it is born along with the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this intellect (<em>al-`aql),</em> as we have mentioned, no-one knows its true reality except Allaah.<span style="font-size:1rem;">And therefore, the people of `</span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ilm-ul-kalaam</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> (theological rhetoric) and the philosophers, they have confused ideas about it and they did not reach a conclusion with regard to the </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">`aql</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> (intellect) because this is not within the scope of their knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the intellect varies:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people there are those whose intellect is complete such as the prophets; Anbiyaa· `<em>alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people, there are those who have no intellect at all such as the insane person and the mentally retarded and the baby.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who are in between; between having complete intellect and between not having intellect. Meaning he has intellect but it is not complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they vary with regard to its deficiency, some of them have serious deficiency in intellect and some of them have slight deficiency and so on and so forth and this is in accordance with whatever Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has put into him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>al-`aql</em> is used to refer to<strong> <em>al-fahm</em></strong> (understanding) also. So it is said “<em>aqalal aayaatil qur&#8217;aaniyyah</em>,” it can be said about a person that he is <em>aqala</em>; meaning he has understood the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan because part of the <em>aayah</em> as evidence:</p>
<p><strong> ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… there are certainly signs for a people who understand.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they understand the signs in creation and the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong>وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ ۖ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَا إِلَّا الْعَالِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those are examples, which We strike for mankind and no-one understands them except for the people endowed with knowledge.</span>  </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Ankaboot (29), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>al-`aql</em>; this word, which is for intellect, it can also be applied to <strong><em>al-fahm</em> </strong>(understanding) and <em><strong>al</strong></em>&#8211;<strong><em>idraak</em> </strong>(comprehension) and <em>al-fiqhu fid-deen</em> (understanding of the religion) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230; will you not then have understanding?</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people, there are those whose intellect is blotted out on account of his disbelief and on account of his heedlessness. So, therefore, he cannot distinguish between what is harmful and what is beneficial. So, he possesses intellect; the faculty, however, he does not derive benefit from his intellect. He is deprived of benefitting from his intellect and Allaah’s refuge is sought, aameen, on account of his disbelief (<em>kufr)</em>. So, he becomes a person who cannot utilise his intellect.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? Rather, they are just like cattle.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah deprives him of his intellect as a punishment for him since he did not use it with regard to that which benefits him. Rather, he only used it in that which contains no benefit or in that which brings harm. So, <em>al-`aql</em> (the intellect) is from the signs of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And action is required from each person in accordance with the level of intellect that he has been given.” </strong></span><em>At-takleef</em> (being bound by religious responsibility and duty) and commands and prohibitions and reward and punishment, all of them are made dependent upon <em>al-`aql</em> (having intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the intellect is not acquired, rather it is just a <em>fadl</em> (favour) bestowed by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” </strong></span>The intellect is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. He is the One Who plants it in the person and it is from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, in His creation. A person does not earn and acquire intellect himself. Yes, a person can strengthen his intellect by reflecting upon the <em>aayaat</em> (signs) of Allaah by carefully pondering upon the Qur&#8217;aan but as for his earning intellect which is not present, then no, that cannot happen. Allaah is the One Who produces intellect in him. He cannot produce intellect himself and earn it himself. However, he can strengthen it.</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَا أَوْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۖ فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَٰكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي فِي الصُّدُورِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not travel upon the earth so that they can have hearts with which they can reason or ears which they can hear with? For indeed it is not the sight of the people that becomes truly blind, rather, it is the hearts which are in the chests which become blind. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this indicates that reflecting upon the creation and reflecting upon the destruction that occurred to the previous nations on account of their disbelief and their sins, this benefits a person and strengthens his intellect, not that it brings about intellect which was not present in the first place.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  In the Arabic language in its origin, the word <em>`aql</em>, it means الحرس <strong><em>al-hurs</em></strong> (withholding something).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>then he said on this point, “his saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">Intellect is inborn</span>,” </strong>meaning that it is born along with the person himself and it grows and increases as he grows. So, the intellect begins as something small and then it grows larger along with its person and there is no doubt that the intellects vary in accordance with that which Allaah has given to each person. And Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has praised in the Qur&#8217;aan, the people of intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of <em>Usool ul-Fiqh</em> (Fundamentals of Fiqh), which Fiqh is based upon, are in agreement that the intellect (<em>`aql)</em> is what being bound by duties depends upon. And then they disagree about whether the intellect (`<em>aql)</em> whether it is in the brain (<em>dimaagh)</em> or whether it is in the heart. And what is apparent is that there is a close connection between the two of them and the action of one will not be completed except with the other one. So, thinking which occurs in the brain will not be completed except by means of the heart ,in what is apparent. However, the brain is the station of thinking and the place of awareness and what duties are dependent upon. And every person, Allaah has prepared him with that which He prepared him with from faculties and thinking and intellect vary very greatly. We ask Allaah to guide us aright, aameen and to save us from the evils of ourselves, aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the great liars have invented <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> with regard to the intellect and it is a <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mawdoo</em>` (fabricated), it is a lie made up in which there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The first thing that Allaah created was the intellect so He said to it, “come forward” so it came forward then He said to it, “go back” so it went back.””<strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <u>h</u>adeeth, which is <strong><em>mawdoo</em></strong>` (fabricated) by consensus of the scholars and there is no doubt that the intellect (<em>al-`aql)</em> is a gift from Allaah for the servant, which distinguishes him from the rest of the creation and on account of it he comes to deserve reward or punishment and Allaah is the One Who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em>, he said after mentioning some speech,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the `<em>aql</em> (intellect) by which a person understands things is a <em>ni`mah</em> (favour) from Allaah, which Allaah has bestowed upon mankind. So with it he can distinguish between the truth and falsehood and between that which is foul and that which is good and between that which is worthless and that which is of value and between innovation and <em>Sunnah</em> and between <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>Shirk</em> and between the way of the <em>Salaf</em> and the way of the <em>Khalaf</em> (the later comers who are not upon their way) and he can distinguish between the path leading to Paradise and the path leading to the Fire. So this is a tremendous favour, which Allaah has bestowed upon mankind to the exclusion of the rest of the created beings upon the earth. So, it is obligatory that we are thankful to Him for it and that we utilise it in that which will draw us closer to Allaah. And the correct and sound intellect conforms to the authentic text and it does not contradict the legislation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 16:</strong> Advice for the one who studied in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and then returned to the land of disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the students of knowledge who benefited from studying in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa&#8217;ah have returned to the lands of the disbelievers, however, there actions show that they are out for the money. So what is your advice to these people?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that calling to Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has a significant status and is deemed to be an honor for the Muslim, for he who is sincere to Allaah in doing it, for verily an abundant reward and a great recompense is anticipated for him, and it is upon the caller to Allaah (Subhaanahu) that he does not exchange that which is better for that which is worse, and it is upon him to know that his mistake is not like someone else’s mistake, for verily he who knows is not like he who doesn’t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he who Allaah has honored with knowledge then does something blameworthy, his punishment is not like the punishment of that ignorant person who perhaps if he knew similar to what this student or caller knew, perhaps he wouldn’t do this forbidden act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) has said in His Noble Book threatening His Prophet Muhammad (‘Alayhis Salaatu Was Salaam), that if he were to lean towards the disbelievers and sway towards them, and he (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) is far above doing that, then Allaah would double his punishment as He (Subhaanahu) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُ ۖ وَإِذًا لَّاتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:73</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْلَا أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئًا قَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:74</strong></p>
<p><strong>إِذًا لَّأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ الْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ الْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيرًا &#8211; 17:75</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you as a friend. And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion of punishment in this life and a double portion of punishment after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Israa (17):73-75</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon these people to fear Allaah and know that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows that which is secret and that which is most hidden, and Allaah (Ta’ala) knows what is in the breasts, and that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows the deceitful eyes and that which the breasts conceal. So if they have gone over there with the pretext of calling to Allaah while in reality there goal is to collect money and enjoy the pleasures of this life, they must know that they are only fooling themselves and that they are only harming themselves. Also, we remind them of the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p><strong>يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“They may hide from the people, but they cannot hide from Allaah, for He is with them when they plot by night in words that He does not approve, and Allaah ever encompasses what they do.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and to make their deeds sincerely for Allaah, and that they either stay over there for the purpose of calling to Allaah and be sincere in doing that and strive hard to convey it, or if not, they must leave those lands and return to the lands of Islaam, and by doing that they will be, Allaah (Ta’ala) willing, a good example for their brothers, and if not, if they don’t do that, then we, by Allaah, we fear for them tribulation in their deen, and we fear that Allaah will not bless them in their knowledge nor in the wealth they gathered because of their turning away from the truth after knowing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us all to beware of that which our Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has warned us, and he has warned us of the temptation of the dunyaa and the temptation of wealth, for verily the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) he is the one who said as can be found in at-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Maalik,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Two hungry wolves released into a flock of sheep are not more destructive than the destruction that a person’s desire for wealth and status has on his deen.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a saheeh hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in at-Tirmidhee with a chain that is hasan from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Iyaad, he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed, for every nation there is a fitnah (trial), and the fitnah of my nation is wealth.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to have contentment, and to strive to implement what they know, and to beware of having greed for the dunyaa and competing with one another for it, for verily, if they were granted small provision in the lands of Islaam along with Allaah granting them the success to obtain knowledge and implement it and stand firm on the deen, then they, by Allaah, would be in prosperity and success as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) informed of in his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He has prospered, he who embraces Islaam and his provision is just sufficient means for living and Allaah has made him satisfied with what comes to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al- ‘Aas. So our advice to these people is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this previous advice of ours is only for he who is truly like that, he who has focused on gathering money, and he has focused on remaining in the lands of disbelief for that reason while at the same time he pretends as if he only wanted to go to those lands for the purpose of da’wah. Also, we advise all of the brothers to think good of their brothers and to beware of thinking bad of the callers and the students of knowledge for nothing other than doubts and notions without a distinct clear proof and clear signs which show that this is what they intend because Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, indeed some suspicion is sin.” </strong></span>&#8211; Al-Hujuraat (49):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) says as has come in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Ta’ala ‘Anhu) transmitted by the two Shaykhs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Beware of suspicion, for verily suspicion is the most false of speech.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) for safety and well-being, and we seek refuge in Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) from every act that our Lord does not love and is not pleased with.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know that evil and good occur by the pre-decree and pre-ordainment of Allaah.</span></strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And that everything which occurs in this creation then it does not occur by chance randomly. Rather, it is something which has been decreed and written in the preserved tablet; <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>fu<u>dh</u></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, knew it and He wrote it in the preserved tablet then He ordained it. Then He created it and He brought it into existence and willed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is found in this creation without its having been preceded by Allaah’s pre-ordainment and pre-decree. <strong>Everything</strong> has been pre-ordained and from that is good and evil. The good which occurs to mankind is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah. And the evil which occurs for them then it is by the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree. And disbelief &amp; true faith and sickness &amp; health and hunger &amp; being full and wealth &amp; poverty; all of this is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 72</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that it is Allaah who spoke to Moosaa ibn `Imraan `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> on the day of the mountain; <em>A<u>t-T</u>oor</em>. And Moosaa heard Allaah’s speech, which was with a voice, which he heard from Him not from other than Him. So, whoever says other than this has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F381540059&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-have-eemaan-that-it-is-allaah-who-spoke-to-moosaa-on-mount-toor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirming <em>kalaam</em> (speech) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is from the fundamentals of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> that Allaah speaks with real speech. Jibreel heard Him and Moosaa `<em>alayhissalaam</em> heard Him when he went towards the fire to take a fire brand and he found that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, spoke to Him from the bush just as Allaah mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and Moosaa heard His speech. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah spoke to Moosaa with speech.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَمَّا جَاءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when Moosaa came to our appointed place and His Lord spoke to him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a second time when Allaah promised him that He would give him the Tawraat so Moosaa went to the appointed place and his Lord spoke to him and gave him the tablets with the Tawraat written upon them. So, Moosaa heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> on the night of the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night ascent) and He made the five daily prayers obligatory upon him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks with speech that is heard and with letters and a voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah then they say, <em>“Allaah does not speak. Because if we were to affirm speech for Him then we would be causing Him to resemble the created being because the created being speaks.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And is analogy to be made between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being? There is a difference between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being. So, those people (Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah) do not make a distinction between Allaah and between the created being, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, as a result of their stupidity in understanding and in intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks in reality with speech that is heard and the Qur&#8217;aan is from the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Allaah spoke with it and He spoke with the Tawraat and He spoke with the Injeel and He speaks whenever He wishes if He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, His speech is from His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. And His actions have no end and no beginning. He speaks whenever He wishes, when He wishes with whatever He wishes, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, <em>al-kalaam</em> (speech) is an attribute of His from His attributes, which are actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“It was from Him, He, the Perfect, not from anyone besides Him.” </strong></span>Not from the tree/bush, not from the preserved tablet, not from Jibreel and not from Muhammad. So it is speech which emanated from Allaah in reality and Jibreel and Muhammad only conveyed and transmitted from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says other than this then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.” </strong></span>Whoever says that the speech of Allaah is created and that Allaah does not speak and he deprives Allaah of speech then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is denying the truth of what Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims unless he is an ignorant person or one who is performing incorrect interpretation or <em>muqallid</em> (blindly following) somebody he has good thoughts about, then this person, it is to be made clear to him and if he then persists then he is judged to be a disbeliever because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebuked the people of <em>shirk</em> for the fact that they worshipped statues, which do not speak. Ibraaheem `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> يَا أَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ وَلَا يُغْنِي عَنكَ شَيْئًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O my father, why do you worship that which cannot hear and not see and cannot benefit you with anything?</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>42)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said to the disbelievers, those who worshipped the idols:</p>
<p><strong> فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُوا يَنطِقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah </em>63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُ خُوَارٌ ۚ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the People of Moosaa after he had departed made from their ornaments the statue of a calf, which produced a mooing sound, could they not see that it could not speak to them?</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that the Lord (<em>Rabb)</em> speaks, He, the Perfect and Most High. And the one who does not speak is not a Lord, how could he then command and how could he prohibit and how could he regulate affairs when he cannot speak? High and Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa:</p>
<p><strong> أَلَّا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It does not say anything to them in return and does not possess any harm or benefit for them.</span> </strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa (20), <em>aayah 8</em>9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Can they see that it can’t say anything to them in return? Meaning, it does not respond to them when they address it.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 70 &amp; 71</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[70] And to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to him in order that <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> should question him about <em>eemaan</em> and its required duties then his soul will be gently removed from him without any pain. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[71] And the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visits him and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished as Allaah wishes. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-al-fitnatu-fil-qabr-the-trial-in-the-grave" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave,”</span> </strong>it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to his body and two angels will come to him; one of them is <em>Munkar</em> and the other is <em>An-Nakeer</em>. So, they will both question him and this is <strong><em>al-fitnatu fil-qabr</em> (the trial in the grave)</strong> and it is the most severe thing that will come upon the deceased. If he is saved from this trial then he will be saved from that which comes after it and if he is not saved from this trial then he will be destroyed. There will be no salvation for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two of them will ask him about three matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Rabbuk</em></strong><strong>? (Who is your Lord?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say “<em>Rabbiyy Allaah”</em> (My Lord is Allaah). Whereas, the <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite) will say, “<em>Hah! Hah!!</em> <em>Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Maa Deenuk?</em></strong><strong> (What is your religion?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say, “My religion is <em>al-Islaam</em>.” Whereas, the hypocrite and the doubter will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Nabiyyuk?</em></strong><strong> (Who is your Prophet?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will reply, “My Prophet is Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Whereas, the hypocrite will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will have his grave extended wide for him and he will have bedding provided for him from Paradise and a door will be opened for him leading to Paradise and its pleasant wind and its pleasant fragrance will come upon him and he will experience bliss in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and the hypocrite, his grave will be restricted upon him and he will be given bedding from the fire and the door to the fire will be opened for him and its heat and its poisonous wind will come upon him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of his saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his soul will be restored to him so that Munkar and Nakeer can ask him about <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and about its legislated duties.”</span></strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> “and the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him,” </strong></span>and therefore it is legislated to visit the graves because the deceased takes comfort in the presence of the one who visits him and this is from the affairs of the <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period). We do not know about the affairs of the Hereafter and the affairs of the intermediate period except what is established by proof because it is from the <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not to be derived from this that anything can be requested from the deceased such that it is said, “<em>Since he knows the one who comes to him then why shouldn’t we request what we need from him?</em>” We say, this was not legislated by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, nothing may be requested from the deceased. The Companions (<em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>) had not used to request anything from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> even though he was alive in his grave <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in a life of <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period), not the life of this world.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished however Allaah wishes.”</span> </strong>From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is to have <em>eemaan</em> in the punishment of the grave and in its bliss, contrary to the Mu`tazilah; those who denied it. They say, “<em>The deceased in his grave is just the same as when we placed him in it, he receives no torment and no bliss</em>,” relying in this upon their intellects and what they see and on their own thinking and they do not believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen). An analogy is not to be made between this world and the Hereafter or between the Hereafter and this world. So, it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the punishment of the grave and the bliss of the grave is established. Indeed it is <em>mutawaatir</em> in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth (meaning something that occurs; every level of transmission of narrations, just so many that every level of transmission, there’s so many people who report it that it’s impossible they could have got together and lied upon it) that the deceased will either be punished in his grave or otherwise, he will experience bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the punishment of the grave and he knows of the texts and he knows of the proofs then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). As for the one who denies it on account of <em>ta`weel</em> (wrong interpretation) or <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) somebody else in that saying or <em>al-jahl</em> (ignorant) of it then this person, the truth is to be made clear to him and if he then persists after it has been clearly explained, then he is just to be a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You find all of this mentioned in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Baraa` ibn `Aazib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (1,369) and reported by Muslim (2,871) in abridged form. And in longer form by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> (4,753).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the angels being named as <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> then that occurs in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> reported by Tirmithee as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,071, said authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you is placed in his grave then two angels; black-blue come to him. One of them is called al-Munkar and the other is called An-Nakeer”.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation on this point that they will ask about <em>eemaan</em> and about its <em>sharaai</em>`<em>ee</em> (legislated duties),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Perhaps what he intended by this is the general questioning because I do not know anything from the Sunnahs, which indicates that there will be questions about the details of <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And likewise on the point that came, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Then his soul will be gently taken out of him again without any pain.” ‘<em>Bilaa alam’</em> (without any pain)</span>, </strong>meaning without the pain which occurred for him at his first death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said with regard to this point, <strong>“and the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visits him,”</strong> this is based upon the authenticity of the <u>h</u>adeeth which occurs about that. But there is disagreement about its authenticity as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The verifier <strong>Khaalid ar-Raddaadiyy</strong> said, “There are a number of a<u>h</u>aadeeth which mention that the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him and takes comfort from his visit. However, nothing from them is authentic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “This is something, which I do not know any proof for, the point that the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visit him. Rather, what is indicated by the proof is just that he hears the footsteps of those who depart after they have buried him.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 69</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise and they return to shelter to lamps beneath the Throne. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-souls-of-the-martyrs-are-within-the-bellies-of-green-birds-in-paradise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise,” </strong></span>for the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (soul) by means of which a person lives and moves and grasps things by his senses, it is a secret matter from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. No-one knows it except Allaah, meaning no-one knows its true reality except Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ ۖ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they ask you about <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em> (the soul). Say, the soul is from the private affairs of my Lord and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>:</strong> Upon the basis that what is meant by the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> here is that by which a person lives; a person and an animal and the rest of the things possessing souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>: </strong>It is otherwise said that what is meant by <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em>; a type of the angels and Allaah knows best.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> in the Arabic language is a term, which is used to refer to that by means of which the possessors of souls will live because <strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaat</em> (life)</strong> is of two categories:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-<u>H</u>arakah:</em></strong> (Moving Life) &#8211; a life which involves movement; animate life and this occurs with those things possessing souls.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-Numoo: </em></strong>(Developing Life)<strong><em> &#8211; </em></strong>life that merely involves something growing and growing, this is what occurs in trees and plants.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them (types of life) is the life of the embryo in the womb of its mother before the soul is breathed into it. But when the soul is breathed into it then it becomes animate life, the life of movement. As for before that then it is just the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (spirit), which is the life of growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the rhetorical theologians and the philosophers are in confusion about the true reality of the soul and they are unable to comprehend it and they stumble and make many mistakes and were unable to comprehend it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> We find the like of that in:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The day when the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> and the angels will stand in rows.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa· (78), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to different types of life, you can refer to <em>Zaad ul-Ma`aad</em> of Imaam ibn ul-Qayyim volume 5 page 755.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said on this point<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“You should know that the souls of the martyrs are in the bellies of green birds that roam around freely in Paradise and they return to lamps beneath the Throne,” </strong></span>this occurs within a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (1,887) and it is the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying though that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are within the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and they are in <em>Sijjeen.</em>”</strong></span> Then I say, as for the well of <em>Barahoot</em> then it is a well to the East of `<em>Adan</em>; Aden of this place in Southern Yemen, between it and between <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt.</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are gathered within it,”</strong></span> there is no authentic proof for this. However, it occurs in a narration whose chain of narration contains a <em>majhool</em> (a person who’s unknown); being reported from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> as was mentioned by the one in the footnotes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad said, “I say what is correct is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informed of:</p>
<p><strong>كَلَّا إِنَّ كِتَابَ الْفُجَّارِ لَفِي سِجِّينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The book of the wicked, they (the wicked), their souls will be in <em>Sijjeen</em>.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>As-Sijjeen</em> is an intensive form from <em>As-Sijn</em> (restriction) and it is a tight or restricted place and it (<em>Sijjeen</em>) is in the lowest depth of the earth as was said by the People of Knowledge. We ask Allah for safety and security from it, Aameen. And we seek Allaah’s refuge from His anger and from His painful punishment and Allaah grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise, the souls of the believers in general, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that the soul of the believer will be a bird, which will come and go in Paradise. The souls of the martyrs, it occurs that they will be in the belly of green birds, which come and go in Paradise and the souls of the believers in general, it is established also in the <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> that they will be birds that come and go in Paradise and this is from the proofs from the bliss of the grave for the soul enjoys bliss just as the body enjoys bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the matter of the souls of the disbelievers that they will be in the well of <em>Barahoot</em>, this is not authentic and it is a well in <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt</em>. And it occurs in some reports, which are brought by the scholars of <em>Tafseer</em> and perhaps they are reports from the <em>Banu Israa`eel</em> (People of the Book), which we do not affirm and we do not deny but however, nothing is established on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The soul of the believer will be a bird, which will eat from the trees of Paradise until Allaah resurrects it returning it to its body on the day when He resurrects it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> al-Jaami` as-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> no. 995 being reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, An-Nasaa`ee, Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ka`b ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 68</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens and he came to the Throne and he spoke to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire and he saw the angels and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and the Prophets were brought out for him. And he saw the drapery of the Throne and the Footstool and everything within the heavens and everything within the earths whilst awake. Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night. And he returned to Makkah that same night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration). </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> “And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens,”</span> </strong>this is from the <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So a part of having <em>eemaan</em> in the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> in his miracles, which prove the truthfulness of his messengership <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the greatest of his miracles are the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. This is the greatest of the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and is the miracle which will remain until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from his miracles <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <em>al-Israa· w’al Mi`raaj</em> (the night journey and the ascent through the heavens). The word <em>al-Israa</em>· (the night journey) is to make a journey by night and the word <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> is to <em>asu`ood</em> (ascend). And he was taken on a journey by night from the sacred mosque in Makkah to the farthest mosque <em>al-Masjid ul-Aq<u>s</u>a</em> in Palestine in a single night in the company of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> and he was taken up through the heavens from Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how he was taken in a single night from Makkah to Jerusalem and then taken up through the heavens and then descended from the heavens and then returned to Makkah in a single night, how did this occur? This was through the ability of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, which is such that nothing can render it incapable. It was not by his own ability <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, rather it came about through the ability of Allaah, which is such that nothing can render it incapable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Buraaq</em> was brought to him and it is an animal, which moves very fast. Its step from one step to the next is as far as it can see. So, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> rode it and Jibreel accompanied him to <em>Bayt ul-Maqdis;</em> to Jerusalem. This is the <em>Israa</em>· (night journey) from Makkah to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> (the ascent) then he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens and he passed beyond the seven levels and reached <em>Sidrat ul-Muntahaa</em> (farthest lote tree) and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and He commanded him with the <em><u>S</u>alah</em> (prayer). And on this night he saw Paradise and the Fire and on this night he saw the Messengers and the Prophets in the heavens and Allaah gathered them together for him and he led them in prayer to make manifest his virtue over them. And Allaah made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers whilst he was in the heaven. Then he <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> descended to Jerusalem then he went from Jerusalem to Makkah in a single night and he entered the morning in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night journey and the ascent) <strong>occurred with his body and his soul</strong>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1] </a>And it was not just with his soul alone as is said by some of those deniers or some of those who find this matter to be something strange and who say that he was taken on the night journey with his soul but not his body. And the <em>Israa·</em> (night journey) <strong>was not a dream</strong>, rather it occurred whilst he was awake and it is a miracle from he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> miracles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Glorified and Perfect is He Who took His servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque, the area around which We have blessed …</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him Our signs. Indeed Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he saw on this night amazing things. Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">certainly saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him from Our signs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw from the signs of Allaah on this blessed journey that which he saw. So, it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and to believe in it and that he should not have the slightest doubt about it. And whoever denies it he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> since he is denying the truth of what has been said about Allaah and denying the truth about what has been said about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire,” </strong></span>he entered Paradise (<em>Jannah)</em> and he saw the bliss that was within it and he saw the Fire and he saw the torment that there is within it because Allaah wished to show him from His signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he saw the angels,” </strong></span>he saw Jibreel in his angelic form having 360 wings, each wing filling the whole horizon. So an angel, his creation is tremendous, his size is tremendous and Jibreel is the greatest one of the angels and the noblest one of the angels, <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So he saw the angels and he saw the Messengers (<em>Rusul)</em> and they are deceased. Allaah gathered them for him and Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he saw the drapery of the Throne (<em>Arsh)</em> and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong></span>and he saw what was around the `<em>Arsh </em>(Throne) and what was around the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) and they are two tremendous created things; the greatest, most tremendous of the created things and what was around them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and everything within the heavens whilst he was awake.”</span> </strong>This is a refutation of those who say that it was a dream. And if it had been a dream, the disbelievers would not have denied it because dreams are not denied. Rather, they denied it happened whilst he was awake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>..  أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… He took His servant on a journey … </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>al-`abd</em> (the servant) is a term for the soul and body together. So, the soul alone is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). The body alone without a soul is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). So it is not called servant unless it is a body and a soul together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel carried him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>,” </strong></span><em>al-Buraaq</em> was an animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night.” </strong></span>This is a proof of the tremendousness of these five daily prayers that they were made obligatory upon the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in heaven between him and Allaah without any intermediary as opposed to the rest of the revealed laws for they came down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst he was upon the earth by means of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em>. So, this shows the tremendous importance of these five daily prayers with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And the time of the night journey was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah and he prayed the five daily prayers in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he returned to Makkah on that night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration).” </strong></span>And he returned to Makkah on that same night and therefore the disbelievers found it something very unlikely and they became overjoyed at this event so that they could belittle the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and ridicule him and mock him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebutted their plot and attested to the truthfulness of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and sent down some Qur&#8217;aan with regard to that.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong>  The night journey and the ascent (<em>Israa</em>· and <em>Mi`raaj</em>) occurred bodily; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with his body and his soul together. You can refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer and <em>Fat<u>h</u> ul-Baaree</em> of Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar and <em>Sharh</em> <em>ul-`Aqeedah</em> <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>ahaawiyyah</em> of Ibn Abee al-`Izz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2] </a><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There’s a <u>h</u>adeeth that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> as no. 306 that describes what happens the next morning after the night journey; how the disbelievers of Makkah reacted. <u>H</u>adeeth that Al-<u>H</u>aakim reported in his <em>Mustadrak</em> volume 3, page 62 from `Aisha <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken on the night journey to Al-Aq<u>s</u>a mosque, he entered the morning telling the people about that. So some people who had believed in him and affirmed his truthfulness turned apostate and they hastened with that news to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and said, “What do you think of your companion, he claims he was taken on a night journey this night to Jerusalem?” So he said, “Did he say that?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “If he said that then he has spoken the truth.” They said, “Will you believe him when he said he went to Jerusalem last night and came back before he entered the morning?” He said, “Yes, I believe him in something which is even harder than that. I believe him with regard to reports which come all the way from heaven, which come down in a single morning or a single evening.” So, therefore, he became known as A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq (the truthful one) who attested to the truth, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.”</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“To have eemaan that the Messenger of Allaah; his chest was split open and the portion of Satan was taken out and it was filled with eemaan (true faith) and wisdom. And he was taken on a night journey by Jibreel upon Al-Buraaq whose step is as far as it could see and he reached Jerusalem and the Prophets were gathered for him and he led them in prayer as their Imaam. Then Jibreel took him up to the lowest heaven and requested that it be opened and each heaven was opened for him and in the first heaven that he found; Aadam and in the second heaven; Ya<u>h</u>ya and `Eesaa and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> heaven; Yoosuf and in the 4<sup>th</sup> heaven; Haaroon and in the 5<sup>th</sup> heaven; Idrees and in the 6<sup>th</sup> heaven; Ibraaheem and in the 7<sup>th</sup>; Moosaa and in one narration the other way around (with regard to Ibraaheem and Moosa) and that Jibreel took him up to Sidrat ul-Muntahaa (farthest lote tree). Then he took him up to a place where he could hear the scratching of pens and he heard the speech of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic when the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So then he went back to Moosaa and informed him so he said, “Go back to your Lord and ask him for a reduction.” And finally his Lord said to him, “They are five and they are 50 (in reward), the saying will not be altered with Me.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can find this narration mentions details reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,342) and Muslim (163) from a narration of Abu Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh says mentioning that <u>h</u>adeeth, “Meaning 5 with regard to their performance and 50 with regard to the reward and each good deed has the reward of 10 times over and that he entered Paradise and he saw in it domes or mounds made of pearl and other than that from the events, which occur in the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj.</em> And this was a matter of extra virtue bestowed upon him granted specifically by Allaah to His Prophet and to the last of His Messengers Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> no-one else shared with him in it. And he entered the next morning in Makkah and when he informed Quraish of what had happened, they rejected what he had said. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي الْقُرْآنِ ۚ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not make that which We showed to you except as a trial for the people a</strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">nd the accursed tree mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and We caused them to fear but it does not increase them except in great transgression.</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Israa (17), <em>aayah</em> 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens,” </strong></span>this is a matter requiring inspection (meaning something doubtful) since he did not carry him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> except when he took him to Jerusalem. What’s correct is that he travelled upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> from Makkah to Jerusalem only, then <em>al-Buraaq</em> was left in Jerusalem then he was taken by Jibreel up through the heavens. As for him ascending from Jerusalem to the heavens then what is apparent that it was upon the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (the heavenly stairway) and not upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> as was said by the author, may Allaah have mercy upon him and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 43 : Point 67</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And speech and argumentation and disputing about <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) in particular are forbidden with all of the sects because pre-decree (<em>al-Qadr)</em> is Allaah’s secret. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Lord, the Majestic, the Most High,</strong><a style="color:#993300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> </span><strong style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">He forbade the prophets from speech concerning pre-decree and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade argumentation about pre-decree and it was detested by the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and by the <em>taabi`een</em> and it was detested by the scholars and by the people of piety and they forbade argumentation concerning pre-decree (<em>al-Qadr)</em>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So upon you is to submit, to affirm, to have <em>eemaan</em> in and to hold as your belief whatever Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said about all matters and to be silent about other than that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F380082461&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/al-qadrpre-decreeis-allaahs-secretdont-arguedispute-about-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And al-Qadaa w’al Qadr (pre-ordainment and pre-decree) refers to the events that will occur that Allaah has pre-decreed and pre-ordained since eternity. And everything which occurs then it does not happen by chance, randomly or without having been pre-decreed by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, knew whatever was, whatever has been in the past and whatever will be in the future. Then He wrote that in <em>al-Law<u>h</u> al-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (preserved tablet). The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first thing that Allaah created was the pen. He said to it, “Write whatever is going to occur until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;. So, the pen wrote whatever was going to occur until the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the creation of the pen was before the creation of the heavens and the earth by fifty-thousand years and the Throne of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, was upon the water.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, here there has been a problematic point for the scholars, was the throne created before the pen or was the pen created before the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne)? And what is correct is that the `<em>Arsh</em> (throne) was created before the pen<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> because at the time when Allaah created the pen and commanded it to write whatever it was going to be then His throne was upon the water and this is why the <em>Allaamah</em>; the great scholar Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>“And the people differ with regard to the pen with which the decreed matters were written by the Great Recompense r(Ad-Dayyaan), Allaah, the Most High, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Was it before the Throne or after it?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>There are two sayings mentioned by Aboo `Alaa al-Hamathaanee,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the truth is that the Throne was before because it was there before the writing, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Before the writing, it stood upon its supports, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the writing of the honourable pen came afterwards,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>After it was brought into existence without any time between.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And speech with regard to pre-decree has already preceded. However, what is intended now is the <strong>prohibition of delving into it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And speech and argumentation and disputing with regard to <em>Qadr </em>(pre-decree) is specifically forbidden,” </strong></span>We already have known that <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment with its levels is a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever does not believe in pre-decree and preordainment, he is not a <em>mu&#8217;min</em> (believer) because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>. And likewise, it is not permissible to argue about pre-decree and pre-ordainment to say <span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;Why will Allaah punish like that? Why does Allaah do such and such?&#8221;</span> as has preceded. It cannot be said why and how? So, no objections, no queries are to be made with regard to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And you are not to enter into pre-ordainment and pre-decree with argumentation for you will not reach any <em>nateejah</em> (result or conclusion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is upon you is to submit and to have <em>eemaan</em> and that you do not enter into any affair from the affairs of Allaah. This (pre-decree)  will not be known except by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and you will not reach any results and therefore it is said, “<strong>Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah’s secret cannot be reached and cannot be encompassed so therefore don’t try to enter into it. It is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (believe) in whatever occurs in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and that you stop at that. And that you turn your attention to performing righteous deeds and to leaving off sins and acts of disobedience and that you do not say, <span style="color:#808080;">“If Allaah has decreed for me that I am from the People of Paradise then I’ll be from the People of Paradise even if I don’t do any action and if Allaah has decreed for me that I am to be from the People of the Fire then I’ll certainly be from the People of the Fire.”</span> So this is false and futile speech, he should not say the like of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not permissible to enter into these affairs because this is not the business of the servant, this is Allaah’s affair. Your business is to act, this is what is required from you. As for entering into pre-ordainment and pre-decree then it is to enter into a maze or a labyrinth from which the servant will never emerge.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is prohibited with all of the sects because the pre-decree is Allaah’s secret,” </strong></span>With all nations because pre-decree is the secret of Allaah and a secret cannot be encompassed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they cannot encompass anything from Allaah’s knowledge except what He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 255)</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot encompass Allaah with their knowledge.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa Haa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not try to enter into the affairs of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, stick to your own affairs, stick to righteous deeds and leaving off sins and performing repentance from them, set your own record in order whilst you are still alive, occupy yourself with yourself. As for occupying yourself with pre-decree and pre-ordainment and &#8220;<em>why did such and such occur</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>If Allaah has decreed all things then  in that case I don’t need to act</em>&#8220;. All of this is false and futile speech, there is no value to it and when the companions said to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Should we not just rely upon what has been decreed for us? He said, “Rather act for everyone will have that which he was created for made easy for him.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّىٰ &#8211; 92:4</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ وَاتَّقَىٰ &#8211; 92:5</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:6</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:7</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:8</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:9</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:10</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Your deeds are diverse so as for the one who gives in charity and is dutiful to Allaah and believes in Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for him acts which are pleasing to Allaah. And as for the one who is miserly and thinks himself to be self-sufficient and denies Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for Him actions, which Allaah hates</strong>.<strong>”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8] </a>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayah </em>4-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should carry out the <em>sabab</em> (means), either for the salvation of your own soul or for its destruction by your actions, which you perform by your own choice and your own will. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All the people go out in the morning and the person then either sets his soul free or he destroys it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And, the Lord, the Majestic, the Most High, forbade the prophets from speech with regard to pre-decree,”</span> </strong>Allaah forbade the creation; the prophets and other than them from speaking about pre-decree. And it is not mentioned from the prophets that they ever raised any objection to pre-decree because they knew the tremendousness of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and His wisdom and they submitted and they adopted correct manners with respect to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and they had not used to ask about anything, which did not contain a point of welfare for them or a benefit, so the prophets would not ask about it. Likewise, the followers of the prophets would never ask about it. Rather, the prophets and their followers used to turn themselves towards action and give attention to it. They did not used to ask about pre-decree and pre-ordainment except from the aspect of belief and having <em>eemaan</em> in it. And having <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment, if you have <em>eemaan</em> in it, it renders you at peace from doubts and from false ideas and from grief. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to befall you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not say: “If only I had done such and such then such and such would have been the case but rather, you should say, “<em>Qadr Allaah wa maa shaa·a fa`al</em> (it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does.)”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade disputing about pre-decree and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum,</em> they detested it and the <em>taabi`een</em>, they detested it and the scholars and the people of piety detested it, arguing about pre-decree.” </strong></span>When the Qadariyyah (those people who denied pre-decree) appeared at the end of the time of the companions, the companions strongly rebuked and refuted them and warned against them and made it clear that a servant, what is upon him is to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that whatever befalls him was not going to miss him and whatever misses him was never going to come to him and that whoever does not believe this then Allaah will burn Him in the Fire.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> So upon this, their sayings were united when the sect of the Qadariyyah appeared in their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So upon you is to submit and to affirm and to have <em>eemaan</em>,”</strong></span> this is what is obligatory upon you with regard to pre-decree and pre-ordainment; submission to the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree and not to raise objections to it and that you believe as your `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah does not do anything except for a wise purpose and that He does not punish anyone except on account of his deeds. So, any deficiencies are from you so instead of blaming pre-decree, you should blame yourself and you should repent to Allaah. So, no-one can prevent repentance (<em>tawbah)</em> and Allaah accepts repentance from those who repent. So, why do you then occupy yourself with something, which will have no benefit for you? So, upon you is to submit and to yield and comply and not to enter into that which is not your concern, There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“From the excellence of a person’s Islaam is that he leaves off that which is not his concern.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And believing whatever Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said about all matters and be silent about whatever is besides that,” </strong></span>Meaning believe whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, the one who does not speak from his own desires and do not make accusations against the a<u>h</u>aadeeth or raise doubts about them. As long as they are established from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then they are not an arena for hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا &#8211;</strong> 4:65</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So know by your Lord they will not be believers until they make you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</em></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> judge in whatever disputes occur between them then they do not find any difficulty in themselves from the judgement you have passed, rather they accept with full submission.</span>  </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not right for any believing man or any believing woman that when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they have any other choice in their affair and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed far away.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of these <em>aayahs</em>. So, what is obligatory upon you is to follow and to submit and to yield and comply. With regard to matters; meaning in all matters, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conveyed from Allaah everything, which the people need from the matters in their religion and he made it clear and Allaah completed the religion through him and there is no good except that he guided his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them from it and he left them upon the clear white path, its night is just the same as its day, no-one strays away from it except one who is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And stay silent upon whatever is other than that.”</span> </strong>This is just as has occurred in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah has made certain duties obligatory upon you so do not neglect them and He has made certain things forbidden for you so do not commit them and He has remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not forgetting so do not ask about them.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not ask about anything except something which you need in your religion or your worldly life. And from the excellence of a person’s Islaam is his leaving off that which is not his concern. As for that which you do not have need of then asking about it is from the superfluous matters; extra unnecessary matters :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade qeel wa qaal </strong>(loose conveying of useless speech) <strong>and asking too much and wasting wealth.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your questions should be in accordance with the level of your need and do not ask about that which you do not have a need of.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: In some wordings; <strong>“He whose name is Majestic” </strong>or in some of the narrations; <strong>“The Exalted and Most High.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan </em>and by a list of others; Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and by others besides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: This <u>h</u>adeeth is declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy and it’s a narration of the companion `Ubaadah ibn as-<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> That’s also been taken from the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth where they mention in a footnote that Muslim reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-Aa<u>s</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah, the Most High, wrote the pre-decreed measures of all the created things fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth and His `Arsh (Throne) was upon the water.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This is the saying of the majority of the scholars and you can refer to the book <em>Bughyat ul-Murtaad</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and likewise <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em> of al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn-Katheer, (right at the start of <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em>) and in that reference al-Haafidh ibn-Katheer mentions that, “The saying that the pen was created first was the saying of some people and he mentioned it was the saying of the famous <em>mufassir</em>; Ibn Jareer a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abariyy and it was the saying of Ibn al- Jawzee and others besides them and as for the saying that the Throne was created first then the pen then this as he mentioned is the saying of the majority of the scholars, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> From the famous scholars of these days who said that the Throne was created first before the pen was Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> and from those scholars who said that the pen was created before the Throne then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>. Then there is some difference amongst the people of the Sunnah with regard to which of those two were created first <em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> From the famous poem <em>Nooniyyah</em> of Ibn ul-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Ibn `Abdul Barr said in his book <em>al-Istidhkaar</em>, “The scholars said and the wise people from olden times said, “Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret thing so do not look into it.””</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation something that is very commonly brought by people with regard to pre-decree,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">“The intellect may say &#8211; &#8220;Allaah has decreed all the decrees of the creation and He has made some of the people; People of Bliss (People of Paradise) and some of them wretched people; People of the Fire. So, the wretched people are therefore not able to be People of Bliss&#8221;, then the intellect becomes bewildered. Therefore, it is obligatory to withhold and to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah does not oppress anyone from His creation and He does not punish anyone from them except with the proof being established.<em> </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a>Taken directly from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strong believer is better and  more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer and there is good in all of them, be eager upon that which can benefit you and seek the aid of Allaah and don’t be incapable and if something befalls you then do not say if only I had done such and such then such and such would’ve happened but rather you should say, Qadr Allaah, it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does because saying ‘if only’, this opens up the door to the action of Satan.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim (2,664).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> From `Abdullaah ibn Fayrooz ad-Daylami who said, “Something occurred in myself regarding this matter of pre-decree and I feared that it would corrupt for me my religion and my affair so therefore, I went to Ubayy ibn Ka`b and I said, <em>‘O Aboo Mundhir, something has occurred in myself with regard to this matter of pre-decree so I feared for my religion and my affair, so tell me something about that so that hopefully Allaah will benefit me through it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said, <em>‘If Allaah were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the people of His earth then He would be punishing them and He would not be being unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better for them than their deeds. And if you had the like of Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold or like the mountain of gold, which you spent it in Allaah’s cause, it would not be accepted from you unless and until you believed in pre-decree so that you know whatever happens to you was not going to miss you and whatever missed you was not going to come to you and if you were to die upon other than this, you will enter the Fire. And there will be nothing wrong for you to go to my brother `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood and ask him.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘So, I went to `Abdullaah and I asked him so he mentioned the like of what was mentioned by Ubayy and he said to me’, <em>‘There will be no harm if you go to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah and I asked him so he said the same as the two of them had said and he said,<em> “Go to Zayd ibn Thaabit and ask him.’ </em>So I went to Zayd ibn Thaabit and I asked him so he said,<em> ‘I heard Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam say</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the inhabitants of His earth then he would punish them and he would not be wronging them and if He were to have mercy upon them then His mercy would be better for them than their deeds deserve and if you had the like of the Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold and you spent it in Allaah’s cause, Allaah would not accept it from you until you believed in pre-decree, all of it so that you know whatever befalls you was not going to miss you and whatever misses you was not going to befall you and if you die upon other than this, you will enter the Fire.”’</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and the wording is his and declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhaab in <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> and likewise declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> Reported by at-Tirmithee who said it’s <em>ghareeb </em>and by Ibn Maajah and by Al-Bayhaqi in <em>Shu`b al-Eemaan</em> and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is some speech with regard to the scholars about the authenticity of this <u>h</u>adeeth, some of them don’t accept the <u>h</u>adeeth being authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and as for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he declared the <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> in his checking of Tirmithee, <u>h</u>adeeth being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

However Shaykh al-Albaaniyy before that in the book 2 <u>h</u>adeeth that  declared <em>hasan</em> (good) a narration with the wording from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Dardaa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 42 : Point 66</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then doubt his Islaam since he is a person having a despicable opinion and saying. No attack may be made upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor upon his companions since we have only come to know of Allaah and His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;aan and what is good and what is bad in this world and the Hereafter by way of the narrations. So, the Qur&#8217;aan needs the Sunnah more than the Sunnah needs the Qur&#8217;aan.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/do-not-deny-or-speak-against-the-narrations-of-the-messenger-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then doubt his Islaam,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Since from the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah is to obey him with regard to whatever he commanded and to believe him regarding whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah is not worshipped except with that which He legislated. This is the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and take it and whatever he forbids you from then keep away from it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· 4, </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 59)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is that he complies with whatever occurs in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> since they are the second revelation after the Qur&#8217;aan. Because the fundamental evidences in Islaam upon which there is agreement are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> the Qur&#8217;aan;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> the Prophetic Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And thirdly,</strong> consensus; <em>Al-Ijmaa`.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences, it is not permissible for a person to say, “I will not accept as evidence except the Qur&#8217;aan alone and I will not accept the Sunnah as evidence,” as is said by the Khawaarij and whoever follows their way and they say that the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission so huge that they cannot be gathered together upon a lie) so they say, “the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> and is rendered secure from deficiencies but as for the Sunnah then it is what is narrated by narrators and is therefore open to deficiencies.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to accuse the whole <em>Ummah</em> (nation) and its scholars and the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (those who conveyed the narrations) in lacking in reliability and of lacking in trustworthiness whereas the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about those people in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“It will soon occur that a man who is full (belly) will be reclining upon his couch and will say &#8220;<em>Between us and you is the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, whatever we find in it to be permissible then we will take it to be permissible and whatever we find in it to be forbidden then we will take it as being forbidden</em>.” Then He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “Indeed, I have been given the Qur&#8217;aan and the like of it along with it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“May Allaah make bright the face of a person who hears my saying and he retains it and he coveys it just as he heard it or sometimes one who has something conveyed to him may better comprehend it than one who actually heard it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said when he gave the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> (address) in Arafah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the one who witnesses amongst you convey to the one who is absent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who heard conveys from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is a trust; <em>amaanah</em>, which was established by the narrators of <u>h</u>adeeth and by the men of <u>h</u>adeeth, may Allaah reward them with good, Aameen. And they protected the Prophetic Sunnah from foreign things and from lies and they conveyed it pure and clear just as it came from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> faithfully and this is from the miracles of this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So, the Sunnah is not an arena for withholding or for making accusations. Rather, it is obligatory to believe it and it is obligatory to act upon it just as it is obligatory to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan because it is <em>wa<u>h</u>iyy</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said with regard to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He </strong>(the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> are revelation from Allaah even though their wordings are from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. As for the Qur&#8217;aan then its wording and meaning is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and as for the Sunnah and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> then their meanings is from Allaah and their wordings are from the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who does not speak from his own desires. So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wordings are preserved from error and are true and are not open to doubt. So, whoever denies the Sunnah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has discontinued the second fundamental. And the Qur&#8217;aan must have the Sunnah because it explains it and clarifies the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have sent down to you the reminder </strong>(the Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> for you to then explain to the people that which was sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nahl (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Sunnah clarifies the Qur&#8217;aan and explains the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are <em>mujmalah</em> (unspecified) such as the prayer (<u>S</u>alaah) and the Zakaah and the Hajj and <u>S</u>iyyaam (fasting), the command for these is in the Qur&#8217;aan but how to perform them is not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. So, the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are unspecified such as the prayer and the Zakaah and the Hajj and fasting, the Sunnah explains them and clarifies them. It explains the Zakaat and its amounts and fasting when it is to begin and when it is to end and the rights of Hajj; how a person should perform Hajj. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of Hajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray just as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine pattern of conduct to follow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah therefore explains the Qur&#8217;aan and clarifies it and indicates it and the person who says, “I will act upon the Qur&#8217;aan but I will not act upon the Sunnah” he is a <em>ka<u>th</u>aab</em> (liar) for he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan has within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it and whatever he forbids you from then desist.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aan, it is stated that the Sunnah clarifies it.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down to you </strong>(Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> the reminder </strong>(Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> so that you should clarify to the people what has been sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he leaves off acting upon the Sunnah then he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan, which he claims that he acts upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are some who make a distinction between the a<u>h</u>aadeeth and who say &#8211; &#8220;<span style="color:#993366;">the <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mutawaatir</em> (<u>h</u>adeeth which has so many narrators at every level of transmission that it is impossible they could have got together and invented it) brings about knowledge (<em>ilm</em>) but the <u>h</u>adeeth which are <em>aa<u>h</u>aad</em> (which doesn’t reach that level), it only amounts to <u>dh</u>ann (surmise/uncerainity)&#8221;</span>. And this is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile) because everything which is authentic from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and which is established, it brings about `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) whether it’s <em>mutawaatir</em> or <em>aahaad</em>. So, there is no distinction to be made between the level of proof of the <u>h</u>adeeth which is authentic. It is obligatory to comply with all of it and to act upon it without any distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Soofees also do not act upon the Sunnah, indeed not even upon the Qur&#8217;aan. They only act upon their own tastes and their own feelings and they say, <span style="color:#993366;">“We take from Allaah directly and we do not take by way of the Messenger because we have reached Allaah so therefore, we have no need of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And the Messenger is just for the common folk, those who have not yet reached Allaah.”</span> And this is from the most baseless falsehood and the most open disbelief and Allaah’s refuge is sought. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Or he denies anything,” </strong>whoever denies the Sunnah in general and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">The Sunnah is not to be acted upon, only the Qur&#8217;aan is to be acted upon&#8221;</span> or who denies a part of the Sunnah, which are the authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">They are not to be acted upon</span>” and some of them say, “<span style="color:#993366;">Hadeeth is not acted upon except with the condition that it conforms to the Qur&#8217;aan</span>” and this is <em>baatil</em> (false and futile) and is an accusation against the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he may bring something which contradicts the Qur&#8217;aan. So, this saying is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sometimes came with things, which were not in the Qur&#8217;aan such as the prohibition of being married to a woman along with her paternal aunt and her maternal aunt. The Qur&#8217;aan contains the prohibition of being married to two sisters, whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A man may not combine a woman and her paternal aunt nor between a woman and her maternal aunt.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to act upon whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you see a person doing any of this; rejecting the authentic narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or denying anything from them then accuse his Islaam for he is a man who is despicable in his position and his saying.” </strong>The person who says this, either he will be from the Khawaarij or he will be from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah or he will be from the Soofees; those who claim that they have no need of the a<u>h</u>aadeeth because they have reached Allaah and they take from Allaah directly and they say, “<em>You people take your religion from someone who is dead but we take from the Everliving One Who never dies</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And no accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor against his companions,” </strong>No accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because he is rendered secure from error by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, the person who accuses the Messenger or attacks him and says that he follows his desires or that he behaves unjustly or that he oppresses and the like of that then this one is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the person who makes an attack upon the companions of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because Allaah is pleased with them and has praised them and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was pleased with them and praised them and repeated words of praise upon them and they were the best of generations. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you are my generation…”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the one in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach even a handsful amount of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 9:100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the First and Foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the An<u>s</u>aar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens of Paradise beneath which rivers flow, they will remain forever therein, that is the tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut–Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree is the tree where the pledge; <em>bay</em>`<em>ah</em> was given at <u>H</u>udaybiyyah; the pledge that the companions gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> year after the Hijrah, pledge of <u>H</u>udaybiyyah, <em>Bay’atu</em> <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquillity upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said at the end of the Soorah:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ ۚ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ ۗ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</strong> &#8211; 48:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him…</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h </u>(48), <em>aayah 29</em>)<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the companions (<em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…those who are with the Messenger (the companions) are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves, you will see them bowing and prostrating seeking the bounty of Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign will be upon their faces from the trace of prostration, that is their description in the Towraat… </strong></span>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description, which is mentioned in the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…and their description in the Injeel.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning their description in the Injeel, which was sent down to ‘Eesaa is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are like a plant, which sends out a side shoot, which strengthens it and it becomes firm and stands straight upon its stalk, the sowers are pleased at it so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> is an example about the description of the companions. So, this shows that the person that becomes enraged at the companions or who hates them, he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) as is shown by the end of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because we have only come to know of Allaah and we have come to know of His Messenger and we have come to know of the Qur&#8217;aan and we know of good and evil in this world and the Hereafter by way of the <em>aathaar</em> (narrations).” </strong>By way of the narrations, which they narrated and they are the a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which they reported from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, whoever makes an attack upon the narrations is making an attack upon the Islamic legislation because it was narrated in that case by narrators who were liars and who are not trustworthy and this is the intent of the Jews and the Magians to plot against the Muslims. So, a group of them abuse the companions and their intent is to abolish the <em>sharee</em>`<em>ah</em> (Islamic legislation) for if they can abolish its carriers and its narrators and they can attack the best ones of this nation then their attacking other than the companions is even more likely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed the Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah has for the Qur&#8217;aan.” </strong>The Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah as we have mentioned because the Sunnah explains and gives explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan. So, there are some things left unexplained in the Qur&#8217;aan, which have been explained in the Sunnah. So, Allaah has commanded the prayer but He has not made clear the number of its rak`ahs and He has not made clear the description of the prayer and this was made clear by the Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <u>H</u>ajj comes in the Qur&#8217;aan <em>mujmalan</em> (unexplained) and its explanation was left to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, he performed <u>H</u>ajj with the Muslims in the Farewell <u>H</u>ajj and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of <u>H</u>ajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, learn from my actions and my sayings what will enable you to carry out your rights of pilgrimage and Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine example for whomever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day and who makes mention of Allaah a great deal.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur&#8217;aan has need of the Sunnah for it to clarify it. So, the person who accepts Qur&#8217;aan only then he will cut off the Qur&#8217;aan from that which explains and clarifies it and this is the goal of the people of misguidance and those who have deviation in their hearts. Because the people of deviation accept one part of the evidences and they leave the other part which explains it and clarifies it off and they take one part of the evidences, which are unclear and they leave the clear and decisive part, which clarifies it and explains it. This is the way of the people of deviation and the way of those who pretend to have knowledge and the ignorant ones; those who claim knowledge and those who do not know the correct way of deriving evidence nor the principles of establishing proof. So, they make forbidden and declare things lawful without any insight and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen,</em> because they have not followed <em>al-manhaj al-`ilm</em> (the correct knowledge based methodology). Rather, they have just learned by themselves or from their own books or with those who are ignorant like themselves.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-no-one-will-enter-paradise-except-by-the-mercy-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 63</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Allaah rewards the martyr (<em>shaheed</em>) for his martyrdom.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378671687&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The martyr (<em>ash-shaheed)</em> is the person who is killed on the battlefield whilst fighting against the disbelievers. He fights so that the word of Allaah is uppermost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this person will be forgiven by Allaah, except for a <strong>debt</strong> (<em><strong>ad-dayn</strong>)</em> which is upon him because a debt is the right of the people and a right of a person will not fall away unless it is given to him or he pardons with regard to it. But as for the sins which are between the person and Allaah then Allaah will forgive them all on account of a person being martyred in the cause of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are also <strong>martyrs who are not killed upon the battlefield</strong> such as a person who dies through the plague, he is a martyr (<em>shaheed)</em> and one who is killed defending his wealth or his honour or his family then he is a <em>shaheed</em> (martyr) or the person who dies in an unexpected accident such as a fire or by drowning, he is a martyr with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, meaning he will have the reward of a martyr but he is not the same as the martyr who dies on the battlefield with regard to rulings. Rather, he is washed and shrouded and a funeral prayer is said over him. <span style="font-size:1rem;">As for the martyr who dies upon the battlefield then he is not washed and he is not shrouded in any clothes except those he was killed in and funeral prayer is not said over him and he is buried with his blood upon him.</span><a style="font-size:1rem;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> When they mention that there are other martyrs besides the martyr who’s killed upon the battlefield, Shaykh Fowzaan mentions examples especially the one who dies through plague, one who is killed defending his wealth or his honour or his family, one who dies in a sudden accident like a fire or drowning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (653) and Muslim reports it also (1,914) on Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The martyrs (<em>shuhadaa</em>) are five; the one who dies of the plague and the one who dies of an abdominal complaint and the one who drowns and the one who has a house structure fall upon him and the martyr who is killed fighting in Allaah’s cause.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wording here is that of Al-Bukhaariyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there also occurs from Jaabir ibn al-`Ateeq <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The martyrs are seven besides the one who is killed in Allaah’s cause; the one who dies of the plague is a martyr and the one who drowns is a martyr and the person who dies from pleurisy is a martyr </strong></span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>and the person who dies of an abdominal complaint is a martyr and the one who dies in a fire is a martyr and the one who dies underneath a building falling is a martyr and the woman who dies whilst pregnant is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and Aboo Dawood, Ibn Maajah and An-Nasaa`ee and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this narration, “It is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam An-Nawawi</strong> said in his explanation of Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said these types of death are <em>shahaadah</em> (martyrdom) on account of Allaah, the Most High bestowing His favour because of their severity and how painful they can be. And there occurs in another <u>h</u>adeeth in the <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever is killed defending his wealth then he is a martyr and whoever is killed defending his family then he is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s already been explained in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> and there occurs in another authentic <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever is killed defending his sword is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nawawi</strong> said that the the scholars said: what is meant by the martyrdom of those people, all of them besides the one who is killed fighting in Allaah’s cause,  is that &#8211; in the Hereafter they will receive the reward of the martyrs. As for this world, then they are to be washed and funeral prayer said over them. And there has already preceded in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> an explanation of that. And the fact that the martyrs are of <strong>three categories</strong>:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>, the martyr who is the martyr with regard to this world and the Hereafter and he is the one who is killed whilst fighting the disbelievers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>, one who is a martyr in the Hereafter but not with regard to the rulings of this life and they are the ones mentioned here &#8211; meaning the two <u>h</u>adeeth we just heard, those who are treated as being the martyr in the Hereafter with regard to the rulings in this life, we can treat them as normal people that have died.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>, one who is apparently a martyr in this world but not so in the Hereafter, he is the person who steals something from the Booty or who is killed whilst fleeing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> said on this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say (with regard to the point that <strong>“the martyr is rewarded for his martyrdom, the sick person is rewarded when he is sick”</strong>) that occurs in authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which show that a Muslim who falls sick is rewarded during his illness because he knows Allaah caused him to become ill and is the one Who cures. As for martyrdom then it is a very high level, which Allaah gives to whoever He wishes from His servants. However, it cannot be attained except through <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> (making ones deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah) and through <em>mutaaba</em>`ah (following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as example). So whoever is killed fighting truly in Allaah’s cause then he is a martyr from the martyrs of this world and the Hereafter if he is killed fighting between the disbelievers and the Muslims. And likewise, one who is killed by the innovators (<em>mubtadi`oon)</em> such as the <em>Khawaarij</em> and their like and that occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth with regard to the <em>Khawaarij</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Glad tidings of a tree in Paradise are for those who fight them and they kill him.”</span> </strong>[Reported by Aboo Daawood and others.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the martyrs with regard to the Hereafter, then they are many and from the martyrs of the Hereafter are the one who dies through the plague, through a stomach complaint, in a fire, being drowned and a building falling upon him and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward. </strong></span>(Surah An-Nisa , aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He does not treat any of His servants with injustice on the Day of Resurrection, be it the weight of a mustard seed or a speck of dust. Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(And We shall set up balances of justice)</strong></span> Allah said that Luqman said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth)</span></strong>. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span> </strong>The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Allah then says, &#8220;Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith&#8221;)</span></strong> In another narration, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(&#8220;Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,&#8221; and they will take out many people.)</span></strong> Abu Sa`id then said, &#8220;Read, if you will,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust).&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 62</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when a man becomes ill, Allaah gives him reward for his illness.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378202253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-causes-afflictions-to-strike-the-believers-to-purify-them-multiply-their-reward" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not allow the reward due to the believers to become lost and He causes afflictions to strike the believers in order to <strong>purify them</strong> or to <strong>multiply their reward</strong>. He may cause calamities to happen to the believer to wipe away his sins and to purify him from sins. And it may be the case that he does not have sins but He still causes them to happen to him in order to raise his ranks in the Hereafter because Allaah has written for him a high rank in Paradise, which he cannot reach through his deeds. So, therefore Allaah tries him with afflictions so that He multiplies the reward for him so that he can reach this level. So the believer is upon good and therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“How amazing is the matter of the believer, all of his matters are good for him. If something pleasing comes upon him then he gives thanks and that will be good for him and if something harmful comes to him then he has patience (<u>s</u>abr) and that will be good for him and that will not be except for the believer (mu&#8217;min).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed the believer is struck by afflictions and they are something beneficial for him for either Allaah will wipe away his sins with them or otherwise Allaah will raise his rank on account of them.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,999) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Suhayb <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge mentioned that if a person is struck by affliction and he has patience upon it then he is rewarded. And if he doesn’t have patience, shows displeasure and the like then that’s something different. W`Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>has <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) and a <em>mu`jizah</em> (miracle) is a matter, which is extraordinary and a person is not able to bring them about himself.

<p style="text-align:justify;">They were demanding that he should himself bring miraculous times to prove his Messengership as they said. But the miraculous times are with Allaah. The Messenger did not bring any sign except from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is the one Who manifests miracles, the Perfect and Most High. And He causes them to happen at the hands of His Messengers to attest to their truthfulness. And an example of that is &#8211; the dead person, if you speak to him, he will not hear you and he will not know what you are saying. However, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>spoke to those who had been killed at Badr from Quraysh, those who used to harm him and harm the Muslims in Makkah and who haughtily rejected true faith and disobeyed and who tyrannized the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and expelled him and who expelled his companions and harmed them. So, Allaah caused them to be overpowered at Badr and they were killed. And their leaders and their eminent people were killed; Shaybah Ibn Rabee`ah and `Utbah ibn Rabee`ah (his brother) and Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam and a large number of the eminent ones of the Quraysh were killed at Badr. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ordered that they should be thrown into an old well from the wells of Badr and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stood over them and addressed them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O so and so, son of so and so! O Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam! O `Utbah! O Shaybah! O Umayyah!” He addressed them one by one, saying “Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true for I have indeed found what my Lord promised me to be true?” So then Umar said to him “O Messenger of Allaah, how can you speak to them when they have started to decay and they cannot hear.” So he <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam responded, “You people cannot hear any better what I am saying than they can. However, they cannot talk.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a miracle from the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which Allaah caused to happen at his hand.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,976) and reported by Muslim (2,873, 2,874 and 2,875).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Narration mentions this happened three days after the battle. In one narration it mentioned when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conquered a people then he would remain at that place for three days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report that he did likewise at Badr, he stayed there for three days and just before he was going to travel and go back to Madeenah, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day then he stood over the old well and said this saying, he spoke to them, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Did you find what your Lord promised you to be true? Indeed, I found what my Lord promised me to be true&#8230;”</span> </strong>To the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say &#8211; the disagreement that there is amongst the People of Knowledge about whether the people in the <em>Barzakh</em> (period in between this life and the hereafter, those in the grave and the like), can they hear those people who address them or is that just specific to the people of that well at Badr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them extend this matter and claim that all the people in that life (the <em>Barzakh)</em> can hear the speech that is said to them and some of the People of Knowledge restrict it to the place where the text is mentioned and that is what is apparent from the established texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the people of <em>Sufism</em> then they extend this matter in a reprehensible manner to the extent that they claim that a dead person even knows what happens amongst his family whether good or bad. And Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> reported in his book <em>Ar-Rooh</em>, some reports from them, which are suspect and Allaah is the one who grants success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih as-Suhaymee</strong> had said on this same point, he mentioned that there are some people who say the dead in general can hear. However, upon verification from the sayings of the people of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, what is correct is that we restrict ourselves in the matter of the dead hearing because it is a matter of the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and unseen) and in matters of the hidden and the unseen, we do not increase upon them upon what occurs from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And what’s established is two cases where the dead hear:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>, the leaders of the Quraysh who were killed at Badr that they heard the words of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>when he addressed them,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the deceased, who has died and been buried; they hear the footsteps of his family going away after they are buried.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that we do not extend the matter any further. Rather, the rest of it falls under the general <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ &#8211; 35:22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you cannot cause those who are in the graves to hear.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Point 60</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that along with every raindrop there is an angel who descends from the sky with it until he places it wherever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic has commanded him to. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377789015&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/along-with-every-raindrop-there-is-an-angel-who-descends-from-the-sky-with-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, sends down the rain from the sky in measured proportion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We sent down rain from the sky in due measure and We caused it to settle in the earth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu&#8217;minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, preordained the coming down of rain and He gave it its due measure and amount and the earth where it should fall. And He distributes it, He, the Perfect and Most High, however He wishes. So, He dispatches it. And He commands and it rains. And He commands and it stops. And along with it are angels. And there occurs in the description of the angel Meekaa`eel that he is entrusted with the raindrops (<em>al-qa<u>t</u>r)</em> and with the plants. So, the angels carry out duties, which Allaah has entrusted them with and from that is <em>al-qa<u>t</u>r</em> (the raindrops).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the verifiers, they mention that this point: <strong>“Along with each raindrop, there is an angel to bring it down,”</strong> then this is reported by Ibn Jareer At-<u>T</u>abariyy in his <em>Tafseer</em> and Abu Shaykh in his book <em>Al-`Azama</em> as being a saying of one of the Taabi`een, Al-<u>H</u>akam Ibn `Utaybah as being his saying and likewise reported by Abu Shaykh in his book <em>Al-`Azama</em> as also being the saying of another <em>Taabi`ee</em> Al-<u>H</u>asan al-Ba<u>s</u>ree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih As-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> then he mentions this report is reported from some of the <em>Salaf</em> and it does not contradict any text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> on this point, “There occurs in the footnote (to the earlier edition) that it is reported from Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no plant upon the land nor in the sea except there is an angel entrusted with it to write down whatever leaf or the like falls away from it</strong>.<strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer) and the person doing the footnotes said so this proves even more so this matter here (meaning there must be an angel for every raindrop as well).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad criticised this saying and said, “This is <span style="color:#ff9900;">questionable from  two aspects</span>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>firstly</strong>, that it is not established from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, that even this report here that’s quoted from Ibn Abbaas, the indication of this report as being proof for what author Baarbahaaree mentioned <strong>“along with every raindrop that descends, an angel comes down until he places it wherever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic commanded him to,”</strong> is not clear since the report mentions writing down whatever is going to fall from that plant where as the issue here is with every raindrop coming down with an angel appointed to bring it down until he places it, meaning something different.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we believe in the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and we believe that Allaah knows every leaf that falls and every raindrop that falls from rain, knows where it’s going to fall. However, the coming down of an angel along with every raindrop until he places it in its place, this is a matter that is not established from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, I say this point is questionable and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Point 59</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Four <em>takbeers</em> (sayings of <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) are to be said for the funeral prayer. This was the saying of Maalik Bin Anas, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u>, A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal and the <em>Fuqahaa</em> (jurists) and this was the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377778497&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/four-takbeers-are-to-be-said-for-the-funeral-prayer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>mas`alatun far`eeyah</em> (matter of detail). However, he mentioned it here because of the disagreement occurring with regard to it and to make clear the Sunnah in that regard because the book is called <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em> (Clarification of the Sunnah). And what is famous with the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) and with the Imaams is that the <em>takbeers</em> that are said over the <em>janaazah</em> (funeral prayer) are four <em>takbeers</em> as occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> prayed funeral prayer over An-Najaashee (the ruler of Abyssinia) in the absence of his body and he said four takbeers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And most of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> mention four and in some of the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>, there is an addition for five or more. However, that which the Muslims have consensus upon is four and whatever is additional to it is a point of disagreement and the Muslim should not go to that about which there is disagreement and leave aside that about which there is consensus and which there is agreement upon and therefore cause trouble to the people particularly with respect to the Imaams of the mosque; they should not cause trouble to the people because the people are not accustomed to any addition to four. So, if you want to pray over the <em>janaazah</em> more than four <em>takbeers</em> then do it yourself but do not cause trouble to the people and bring them rare and obscure sayings and divergent reports for this is not from the way of the student of knowledge. The students of knowledge should bring harmony amongst the people and not cause trouble to them and they should act upon which there is consensus and restrict themselves to that. This is what is required and this is the intent of the author in mentioning the four because that is what is agreed upon. So, they should not be added to and trouble therefore caused to people in that regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is the saying of Maalik Bin Anas and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal,” </strong>Maalik ibn Anas is the Imaam of <em>Daarul-Hijrah</em>  (the Imaam of the place where the <em>Hijrah</em> was to, meaning the Imaam of Madeenah); Imaam Maalik was one of the four Imaams. And Sufyaan ath-Thawree; he was Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ath-Thawree, the famous Imaam from the Imaams of <em>fiqh.</em> And Al-<u>H</u>asan ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> ibn <u>H</u>ayy; he was from the major Imaams. And A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal; he was one of the four Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it was the saying of the jurists; the people of <em>fiqh</em>, <em>Fuqahaa</em> and this was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,” </strong>meaning it is the saying of many of the jurists who are following the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, it is not befitting for the student of knowledge to cause trouble with the people with the argument that he knows that there is another saying or another <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> with regard to an addition. The scholars used to know that there was disagreement in certain matters but they would not bring this and cause trouble to the people nor would they contradict that which action was upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Najaashee died in his own land, nobody prayed over him in his own land so the Prophet was informed by revelation that he had died so led the companions in Madeenah in funeral prayer for An-Najaashee in that different land and said four <em>takbeers</em> over the <em>janaazah</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 57-58</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[57] And you should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever missed you was never going to come to you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[58] And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377740142&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-whatever-befalls-you-was-never-going-to-miss-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the text of the <u>h</u>adeeth just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to Ibn Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And know that whatever befalls you was not going to miss you and whatever comes to you was never going to miss you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever strikes you was never going to miss you; whatever misses you was never going to come to you. Even if you eagerly sought after it and want it but it missed you then you should know that Allaah did not decree it for you and whatever came upon you was never going to miss you. So, do not say, “If only I had done such and such this wouldn’t have befallen me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this follows on from the levels of preordainment and predecree. It contains a refutation of whoever says that the person creates his own actions. So, Allaah, He is the one Who is alone in creating, He, the Majestic and Most High. No-one can create along with Him. So, it is all from the creation of Allaah alone, He, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ ۖ ائْتُونِي بِكِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَٰذَا أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see whatever you invoke besides Allaah, show me what they have created in the earth or do they have any share with Allaah in the heavens? Bring me any scripture, which came from Allaah before this Qur&#8217;aan, which states this or any remnant of knowledge, which proves it, if you are truthful.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom they worship besides Allaah can never create even a fly even if they all gather together to do it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who can create just as He creates such that the creation is confused for them. Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the one, All-Powerful Subduer.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`ad (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, described those who make images in His saying: (as part of Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So who is a greater wrong-doer than someone who tries to create like My creation.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he tries to produce the outward form of that which Allaah has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of the narration mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. let them then create a single grain of corn or let them create a single barley corn.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. or let them create the tiniest ant.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No-one is able to do this and if someone is able to fashion the outward form (<em><u>s</u>oorah),</em> he is not able to produce life in it. The life is from the creation of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one is able to do it even if he can make a precise image and form or something, he is not able to breathe a soul into it and to put life into it. This is the creation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and therefore, it would be said to those people who make images on the Day of Resurrection:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Give life to that which you created.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to manifest their inability and as a punishment for them.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 54-56</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[54] And to have patience with the judgement of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[55] And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all the decrees of Allaah, the good and the bad, the sweet and the bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[56] Aand to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has said. Allaah knew whatever the servants were going to do and where they were heading to, they do not escape from the knowledge of Allaah and there is nothing in the earth or in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377372234&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mention of this has already preceded at the beginning of the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa W’al Qadr</em> (preordainment and predecree). And using predecree and preordainment as an evidence when calamities strike, which a person <strong>does not have a choice about</strong>, is something praiseworthy because this shows his being satisfied and his submitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:155</p>
<p><strong>الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:156</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give glad tidings to those who have patience, those who when they are struck by calamity, they say “Indeed we belong to Allaah and to Him we shall return.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 155-156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for using predecree and preordainment as a proof for <strong>evil deeds</strong>, which they <strong>commit and do by choice</strong> then they have no argument in predecree for that. Rather, they are punished for their deeds and they are falling short and the gate to repentance is open instead of arguing with Allaah saying: “Why did You decree this upon me?” while you have abandoned the repentance. This is from blameworthy inabilities. Rather, hasten to repentance and seek forgiveness and blame yourself. So, this is what is required from the servant that he should look at his own deeds.</p>
<p><strong> وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 59:18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let each soul look and see what deeds it puts forward for the Day of Judgement.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at your deeds, it is possible for you to change them and to repent from them and to seek forgiveness. As for preordainment and predecree then that is the affair for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, it is not your matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they will not exit from the Knowledge of Allaah,” </strong>everything Allaah has full knowledge of it and He, the Perfect and Most High fully encompasses it. He knows the disbelief of the disbeliever and the sin of the sinful person and the oppression of the oppressor. It is not hidden from Him. He knows the obedience of the obedient person and the actions of the obedient person. He knows this and that. However, He gives them some respite, gives them some time perhaps they will repent, perhaps they will return back. So if they repent, well and good otherwise in front of them is the reckoning; the <em>hisaab</em>. So, Allaah does not neglect them at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And there is not in the earth nor in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this is just as has preceded, everything is known by Allaah, whatever was in the past and whatever will be in the future, all of it Allaah has encompassed it with His Knowledge, nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. He knew it and He decreed it and He wrote it and He wished it and willed it and He created it.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 53</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to be pleased and satisfied with the decree of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377268440&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-be-pleased-and-satisfied-with-the-decree-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>al-Qa<u>d</u>aa w’al Qadr</em> (Allaah’s preordainment and predecree). This is a <em>rukn</em> (pillar) from the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, which are mentioned by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">You have eemaan (true faith) in Allaah, and in His angels, and His books, and in His Messengers, the Last Day and that you have true faith in al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that you believe that Allaah has preordained all things and predecreed them always and He, the Perfect and Most High, has written them in the preserved tablet and He created it and brought it into existence by His wish, He, the Perfect and Most High. And having <em>eemaan</em> in predecree and preordainment covers <strong>FOUR</strong> levels:</p>
<p><strong>The First Level:</strong> Level of <em>al-`ilm</em> (knowledge), which is that Allaah knew by His Eternal Knowledge all things before they came into existence.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Level:</strong> To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah wrote all things down in the preserved tablet before they existed. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ &#8211; 57:22</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls upon the earth nor in yourselves except that it was written in a book before We brought it about. Indeed that is easy for Allaah. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level: </strong>To have <em>`eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah willed and wished these newly occurring events. Disbelief and true faith, obedience and disobedience, righteousness and wickedness, good and evil; all of that was willed and wished by Allaah, by His will relating to the creation, His <em>Iraadah al-Kowniyyah</em>. So, nothing occurs within His Sovereignty except that which He wills. However, He willed the good and He willed `<em>eemaan</em> and He willed evil for a <em><u>h</u>ikmah</em> (wise) purpose as a trial and as a test. So, Allaah willed that which is good and He loves it and is pleased with it and He willed that which is evil but He does not love it and He is not pleased with it. However, He willed it to occur for a wise purpose and in order to test and to try. And if there nothing except good then there would be no distinction for anybody and there would be no test and no trial, all of the people would be people of good. And if there were nothing except evil then there would be no distinction for anyone in performing righteous deeds. So, this gives the result that Allaah tries the servant to make clear the good from the foul and the believer from the disbeliever and it is a trial and a test, which He, the Perfect and Most High brings about for them and He did not create these things without purpose.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The Fourth Level:</strong><em> Al-Khalq w’al eejaad</em> (creation and bringing into existence); whatever happens Allaah is the one who created it and brought it into existence. And everything that occurs then Allaah is its Creator. And the actions of the people are created by Allaah and they are actions done by the servant. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ</strong> &#8211; 39:62</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the Trustworthy Disposer of all affairs.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 36:81</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He, Allaah is the All-Knowing Creator Who creates repeatedly.<br />
</strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 37:96</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah created you and whatever deeds you do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aafaat (37), <em>aayah </em>96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, meaning people’s deeds, good or evil and they are actions done by the servants and things earned by the servants by their own choice and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the true believer believes in these four levels; (1) <em>al-`ilm, (2) w’al kitaabah, (3) w’al mashee&#8217;ah w’al iraadah, (4) al-khalq w’al eejaad.</em>These four levels with regard to predecree, the believer believes in them; the level of knowledge, the level of writing and the level of wish and will and the level of creation and bringing into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>And the believer is pleased and satisfied with predecree and preordainment. When calamities occur, he does not become annoyed and does not become vexed. He withholds himself from annoyance and he withholds his tongue from complaining to other than Allaah and he withholds his hand from striking the cheeks and tearing the openings of the garment. So this is being pleased and satisfied with the preordainment and predecree</strong>.</span> And it is that you know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to happen to you just as the Prophet said, and `<em>eemaan</em> will not be completed except with this.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (Hadith No.8) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Umar ibn al-Khattaab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and this is a part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel where Jibreel `alayhissalaam came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man and asked him about `<em>eemaan</em> and <em>Islaam</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em> and the signs of the Hour, this was the answer the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave when he was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“What is `eemaan? And he replied that it is that your truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in predecree; the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth, reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> and Ibn Maajah in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Ubaadah ibn a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. Declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan by Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhaab in his book At-Taw<u>h</u>eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Also declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Being pleased and satisfied with that which Allaah has decreed should occur&#8221; &#8211; This is a tremendous level and what is meant by &#8216;<em>what is ordained should occur</em>&#8216; here? It is that it means which a person has no actions himself in bringing about such as illness and health, being rich or being poor and death and all of the calamities that occur, that which strike the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the people are divided into <strong>two categories</strong> with regard to them or it is to be said the servant here, there are two states that he can have in this case; one of them is higher than the other:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The first of them is <em>ar-ri<u>d</u>aa</em></strong> (being pleased and satisfied) with that and it is the highest condition such that he is pleased whatever Allaah has decreed to occur, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and whatever provision He has given you a share of and with whatever calamities He has preordained for you. So, being pleased and satisfied with these decrees, which strike the servant from Allaah these are things, which come purely from His decree. Neither the person himself nor anyone else can repel them and being pleased with these decrees is a tremendous level and it is an honourable state of the soul such that the servant is hoping for the reward that will come about as a result of the calamity after it strikes him such that if he were to be given a choice between receiving the reward for it or that calamity not occurring he would choose the reward instead. You have the first and the highest level.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>So if he is not from the people of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em>, those who are actually pleased with it then at least let him be from the <strong>People of <em><u>S</u>abr</em> (have patience)</strong> upon it. This is the 2<sup>nd </sup> level So, he still has patience when that is decreed to happen to him. So, he bears it hoping for reward for it and in submission to the decree and the ordainment, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic said:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ &#8211; 2:177</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those believers who have patience upon extreme poverty and illnesses and at the time of fighting. They are the ones who are true and they are the ones who are dutiful to Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah loves a people, He puts them to trial. Whoever is pleased, then Allaah’s pleasure is for him and whoever is angry then there is anger for him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad. Also, reported as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mahmood ibn Labeed, slightly different wording. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>A point of note from Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to be pleased and happy with sins nor to use predecree as an excuse for them. Rather, it is obligatory to strive to remove them and Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever amongst you see an evil, let him change it with his hand and if he is not able then with his tongue and if he is not able then with his heart for that is the weakest of <em>eemaan</em></span></strong>. [Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it can be imagined that the disbelievers occupy a land from the lands of the muslims, is it permissible that we just say that this is a matter of predecree and leave it as that and not strive to remove this evil until we free the muslims in their lands so that they are at peace from being overcome by the diebeleivers? The answer is that it is not permissible for us to just be silent about that nor should we be pleased and happy with it nor just have patience upon that and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari<a title="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> said About Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon<a title="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. <span style="font-size:1rem;">Compiled &amp; translated </span><span style="font-size:1rem;">By </span><span style="font-size:1rem;">Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 – al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Rafidah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> ‘In the past I heard about the group al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who had gathered in the era of King Farooq <a title="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and agreed upon a point that they clarify, which is that the <i>Rafidah</i> (the Shia) are regarded as a school of thought from the schools of thought of the Muslims, and therefore, they must be included amongst the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon.  This is why they were the ones who aided the Khomeni revolution and were happy with it, and they said there is no Islaam except with him (Khomeni).’<a title="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b)</b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Indeed the Ikhwan al-Muslimoon are from the helpers of Khomeni and the <i>Rafidah</i> (Shia).’<a title="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3 – Are al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Tableegh from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who are the <i>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</i>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They are those who adhere to what the Companions were upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner asked: ‘Are the Salafiyoon, the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Yes, <i>as-Salafeeyah</i><a title="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> is the Sunnah and the <i>Jammah</i>; because the meaning of <i>Salafeeyah</i> is adhering to what the <i>Salaf as-Salih</i> were upon in the past.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Shaykh, regarding the Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Everyone who is upon a thought which opposes the Ahl-ul-Sunnah, then he is not from them, therefore the <strong>Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are not from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah</strong>, because they have thoughts which oppose the Ahl-ul-Sunnah.’<a title="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4 – Doubts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not come close to Jamat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon since everything they have is doubtful.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5 – Sayyid Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> A man asked Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are some people who identify Sayyid Qutb with the title ‘Reviver’?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh disapproved of this title and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What did Qutb revive? Did he revive <i>Tawheed</i>? Meaning did he call to <i>Tawheed</i>?  Or did he revive the call to judge by what Allaah has revealed, and that was by authoring a book, actually all his speech was philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b) </b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Sayyid Qutb has a lot of <i>Hizbeeyah</i> and many customers.’<a title="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6 – Muhammad Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Muhammad Qutb the blood brother of Sayyid Qutb is a dangerous Ash’ari.  He authored a book of <i>Tawheed</i> for the Saudi education ministry and this book was all rhetoric and philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7 – Surooreeyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Surooreeyah are a group from the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who broke away from them and live in London.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah such that there is no <em>shirk</em> in it for Allaah will not accept any action except that which is done purely and sincerely for His Face, having no <em>shirk</em> in it nor association of others along with Him in it. And this is one of the <strong>two conditions</strong> for an action to be acceptable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second condition</strong> is <em>al-mutaaba`ah</em> (following the example of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in doing that action) and acting upon the Sunnah such that the action is in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> such that it does not contain <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) because Allaah does not accept innovation. Rather, He punishes for them even if a person exhausted himself in doing deeds. If he did not make the deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah, then they will be scattered dust. And if a person exhausted himself in doing a deed which is not in conformity with the Sunnah then it will be rejected. And it will not be accepted except along with these two conditions that it is done purely and sincerely for Allaah alone and it’s done in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:111</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">And they (the People of the Book) said no-one will enter Paradise except for one who is a Jew or a Christian. That is their false hope. Say, “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.” </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">111)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, this is to refute what they are negating.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rather it will be entered by whoever submits his face to Allaah and he is a doer of good then his reward will be with his Lord and there will be no fear upon them nor will they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever submits his face to Allaah,” </strong>meaning he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is a doer of good,” </strong>meaning one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and this applies to everyone, the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the world, it must be with these two conditions; with purity and sincerity for Allaah and with following the Messenger.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey, the reptiles, even between the tiniest ants until Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic brings about retribution between them. For the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise and for the People of Paradise from each other and for the People of the Fire from each other. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-qisaasretribution-on-the-dayofresurrection-between-all-of-the-creation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is already preceded that Allaah will resurrect the creation on the Day of Resurrection in order to recompense them for <strong><em>jazaa</em></strong>· (to give them their due reward), in order to recompense them for their good deeds and their evil deeds with regard to the descendants of Aadam. And for <strong><em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> </strong>(retribution/revenge/retaliation ) to be established with regard to again the descendants of Aadam and for the animals. So, the animals will be resurrected for <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(retaliation) only, whereas the descendants of Aadam will be resurrected for jazaa (recompensing) and <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliation) between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the retribution on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey and the animals,” </strong>all of them will be raised for <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) between them. As for the animals then when vengeance has been taken from some for others then they will end up being turned to dust. But as for the descendants of Aadam then they will be in two groups; a group will be in Paradise and a group will be in a Blazing Fire and they will not die after that ever. They will remain forever either in Paradise or in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Even to the extent that retaliation will be taken for the tiniest ant from the other tiniest ant,” </strong>to the extent that <em>a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>th</u>arrah</em> (tiniest ant) will gain vengeance over each other because Allaah does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) ever because He is the most just and wise of Judges and He is the most just Arbitrator. He does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) even between the animals and the tiny ant. On the Day of Resurrection they will be resurrected and vengeance will be taken for some upon others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>mu&#8217;minoon</em> (believers) and the first matter concerning which retribution will be taken between them on the Day of Resurrection will be with regard to the shedding of blood from the rights of mankind and they’ll take revenge upon each other after they have crossed over the <em><u>s</u>iraat</em> (bridge) of the Hellfire and before they enter into Paradise. They will be stopped and retribution will be taken from some in favour of others. And then when they have been cleansed and purified, permission will be given to them to enter into Paradise because no-one will enter Paradise whilst he has any act of oppression due upon him. Because Paradise is the abode of those who are good and pure and no-one will enter it except those who are good and pure, those who have no reckoning left upon them nor anything owed to anyone else nor any sins to the extent that the believer who is sinful will be punished in the Fire in accordance with the level of sin or otherwise Allaah will pardon him in accordance with His wish and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk</em> is committed with Him but He forgives whatever is less than that to whomever He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to any sins that are less than <em>shirk</em>, if He wishes, He will forgive him and if He wishes, He will punish him in accordance with the level of his sins until he becomes clean and purified from sins then he will enter into Paradise. So, no-one will enter into Paradise except one who is pure, be it by recompensing or by punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“To the extent that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will bring about retribution between them for some from others and for the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise,” </strong>so, the believer if he has wronged the disbeliever then retribution will be taken for the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection and vice versa. The disbeliever if he has wronged the believer then retribution will be taken for the believer on the Day of Resurrection. So, no-one will be just left having acts of oppression left upon him and to the extent that the believer will be avenged upon the believer.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said with regard to this point, “There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will call out on the Day of resurrection and say “al-Malik and ad-Dayyaan (I am the King, I am the One Who brings about retribution) and it is not befitting that anyone from the People of the Fire should enter the Fire whilst he has anything due from the People of Paradise that is due to him nor is it befitting for anyone from the People of Paradise to enter Paradise whilst there is any right due from him for someone from the People of the Fire until I take retribution for him even if it is for a single slap.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So we (companions) said, “How will it be when it is the case that we will come to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic naked, uncircumcised and empty-handed?”. </strong></span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said, “with good deeds and bad deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that they will not enter the Paradise or the Fire until the rights have been be taken from them for each other. Then when they have been purified and cleansed and the People of Paradise will be entered into Paradise and the People of the Fire enter the Fire and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 37 : Point 50</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything that Allaah has decreed should pass away will pass away but not Paradise, the Fire, the Throne (<em>`Arsh)</em>, the footstool (<em>Kursee)</em>, the Horn (<em>A<u>s-S</u>oor)</em>, the Pen (<em>Qalam)</em> and the Inscribed Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh)</em>. Nothing of these will ever pass away. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Then Allaah will resurrect the creation upon what He caused them to die upon on the Day of Resurrection and He will bring them to account as He wishes. A group will be in Paradise and a group will be in the blazing Fire and He will say to the rest of the creation; those who are not created to persist, “Be dust.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And everything that Allaah has made it binding for that it will pass away then it will pass away</strong>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong> &#8211; 55:26</p>
<p><strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong> &#8211; 55:27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon the earth will perish but the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the creation will pass away and nothing will remain except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and in His saying, He, the Perfect:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He, the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَنُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ اللَّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will fall down dead except whomever Allaah wishes.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <em>illaah mann shaa-Allaah</em> (except whomever Allaah wishes). They (the People of Knowledge) said, “it means the angels or the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oor (women in Paradise) and Allaah knows best.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the whole of the creation will die and then they will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ &#8211; 23:15</strong></p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ &#8211; 23:16</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then after that you should die then on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up to life. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>15-16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Muslim should remember death and he should prepare for it with righteous deeds and he should ask Allaah that his life ends with a good conclusion (<em><u>h</u>usn ul-khaatimah)</em> and he should repent from evil deeds and this is the benefit of remembering death. When he remembers death then he should make preparation for it and therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Remember the cutter off of pleasures; death for you will not remember it over a large amount except that it will render it small nor over a small amount except that it will increase it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not befitting that the Muslim should be inattentive to death. Rather, he should remember death always at all times and he should prepare for it and he should have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in the resurrection; the Day when mankind will rise from their graves, standing up for the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong> &#8211; 39:68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then the Horn will be blown again and they will be standing, looking on.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The souls shall be restored to them after the bodies have been resurrected from the graves and then they will be led to the gathering place (<em>ma<u>h</u>shar)</em> to the end of what they encounter in the Hereafter from great hazards that they will have to pass through until they settle after that either in Paradise or either in the Fire for indeed Paradise and the Fire are the two abodes of permanent residents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“Everything will pass away except what Allaah has written to pass away will pass away but not Paradise, not the Fire and not the `<em>Arsh</em> (the Throne) and not the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong>for they will not pass away; those two (Paradise and the Fire), they will not pass away and they will not seize to exist. Allaah created them to persist. And as for the heavens and the earth then they will be changed. The heavens will split apart and the earth will split open and this universe will change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الْأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ ۖ وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</strong> &#8211; 14:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the earth is changed to other than the earth and the Heavens and they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the people)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will appear before Allaah; the One, the Irresistible Subduer.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) then it will not change and Paradise and the Fire will not pass away and will not change. <em>W’al Kursee</em> (and the Footstool); it is below the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is bigger than it and the <em>Kursee</em> is wider than the heavens and the earth and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is wider than the Footstool.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Horn,” </strong>the <em><u>S</u>oor</em> is the Horn, which is the Horn which is with the Angel Israafeel. It will be blown along with the souls in it and the souls will fly back into their bodies and come to life with the permission of Allaah.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then it will be blown another time and they will be standing up looking.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Pen and the Preserved Tablet,” </strong><em>Al-Lawh ul-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (Preserved Tablet) and the Pen with which Allaah wrote the decreed measures, meaning the decreed measures of how everything would be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Nothing from this will ever pass away,” </strong>these things which Allaah created to persist; the Throne and the Footstool and the Preserved Tablet and the Pen and Paradise and the Fire and the souls, which were created then they will not pass away.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then Allaah will resurrect the creation upon what He caused them to die upon on the Day of Resurrection,” </strong>meaning He will resurrect them upon what He caused them to die upon with regard to disbelief or true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>, everyone will be resurrected upon his deeds, meaning upon the deeds that he did. And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the resurrection is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Last Day occurs joined along with <em>eemaan (true faith)</em> in Allaah in many <em>aayahs.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>W’al Ba’th</em> (and Resurrection), it is restoring mankind to life after their death in the world of the Hereafter. So, they live in this world for the purpose of action then they will die and they will be buried in the earth and they will remain in it for as long as Allaah wishes in the place of waiting and that is <em>Daar</em> <em>ul-Barzakh </em>(Place of Separation), the period separating this world and the Hereafter.Then they will be resurrected from these graves and they will arise from them alive just as they used to be, nothing from their bodies will be lost then the souls will be restored to their bodies then they will be led to the <em>mahshar</em> (gathering place) for the recompensing for their deeds, which they did in the world whether good or bad.</p>
<p> <strong>وَلَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 36:54</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And you will not be recompensed except for what you did. </strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one will be rewarded for good that was done by somebody else or punished for the action of someone else.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of sins committed by someone else.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his own deeds whether good or bad and this is justice (<em>adl)</em> from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He will not leave them without any recompensing when they had wearied themselves in this life in performing deeds and worship if they were righteous ones. Or wearied themselves, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, with disbelief and <em>shirk</em> and sin and causing corruption upon the earth if they were disbelievers. He will not leave them without a recompensing. This is justice from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, this is the meaning of His saying here that everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his deeds. And since this is the case then it is obligatory upon the servant to look to his deeds, whilst he’s still alive. So, whatever is good then he should equip himself with that and whatever is evil then he should repent to Allaah from it and free himself from it as long as that is possible. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, fear and be dutiful to Allaah and let each soul look at what deeds it has put forward for tomorrow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take account of yourself in this world before the reckoning, take account of yourself for your deeds and examine them and rectify whatever is corrupt from them and add to whatever is good from them and awaken from heedlessness. This is what is required from the person of intellect and therefore, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Al-kayyis (the wise one) (meaning al-`aaqil (the prudent one)), the person of intelligence, he takes account of his-self and acts for that which comes after death. This is the astute person, the `aaqil. And the incapable person is the one who allows himself to follow his desires (meaning in this world) and just has vain hopes in Allaah.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The incapable person is the one who allows himself just to follow his desires and just has vain hopes in Allaah</strong>, he wants paradise and he wants salvation but he doesn’t do anything. So, this person is incapable, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen</em>, with blameworthy incapacity, it is not physical inability. If he is actually not able to do i.e he does not have the ability to perform deeds, then this one would not be taken to account.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not burden a soul except with what it is able to do.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this one; the <strong>`<em>aajiz</em> </strong>(truly incapable person) has ability and he is able to act but the inability is due to laziness &amp; not-caring. This is the one who is truly incapable and yet along with this, he has vain hopes that in the Hereafter he will be from the people of Paradise without any deed, without any action. It is not possible that this one will be from the people of Paradise without any deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will take account of them as He wishes, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>He will take account of them for their deeds, He, the Perfect and Most High and <em>Al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the Reckoning), it is al-<em>munaaqashah</em> (examination) regarding the deeds. So, the people will be in different categories with regard to reckoning. Four categories of people with regards to reckoning in the herefater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the believers, there will be those who will receive no reckoning so he will enter Paradise without any reckoning and any punishment. May Allaah make us from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them will be those who will be given an easy reckoning and that is just presentation of records.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who will be interrogated in the reckoning :<br />
<strong>“Whoever is closely examined regard his record will be punished.”</strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) will not be reckoned with a reckoning involving weighing of deeds. Rather, he will only be reckoned with a reckoning that involves confessing that he will be shown his deeds and his disbelief and his <em>shirk</em> for him to confess it and he will not be able to deny anything at all then he will be sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“There will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>this is derived from the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ الْجَمْعِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِيرِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And warn them of the Day of the Gathering about which there is no doubt, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire. </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group there will be in Paradise</strong> and they are the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) <strong>and there will be a group in the blazing Fire</strong> and they are the people of disbelief and transgression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will say to the rest of the creation from those who are not created to persist, “Be dust”,” </strong>Allaah will raise up the creation on the Day of Resurrection; the humans and the animals and the birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّا أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم ۚ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not a creature upon the earth nor any bird, which flies with its two wings except that they are communities like you. We have not neglected anything from the Book. Then they will be gathered to their Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when the wild beasts are gathered. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The created beings will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in order to establish justice between them to such an extent that revenge will be taken from some for others. The animals; revenge will be taken from some in favour of others to the extent that revenge will be taken for the hornless ram from the ram (male sheep) with horns as occurs in the authentic hadeeth.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then when vengeance has been taken from some for others, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will say to them “Be dust” because they were not raised up to remain and persist in the Hereafter. Rather, they were only raised up for recompensing only and this is from the justice of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Then the disbeliever will say:</p>
<p><strong> يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> “would that I could be dust.” </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa (78), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it will be said to the animals “Be dust”, the disbeliever will vainly wish that he could be like them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This was mentioned by Al-Baghawee in his Tafseer from A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak; famous <em>mufassir</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan referred from a group of <em>Taabi’een</em>, A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak ibn Muzaahim al-Hilaalee al-Khurasaanee who died in the year 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee mentions that he said (referring to the ones who are accepted), “they are Ridwaan and <em>Al-<u>H</u>oor</em> (the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oorees) and Maalik and Az-Zabaaniyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> The first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth, <strong>“remember the cutter off of pleasures; death,”</strong> is reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and an-Nasaa`ee and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan in his <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. That <u>h</u>adeeth up to that wording there was declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em>; <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good; authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the full wording then al-Bayhaqee reports that wording <strong>“&#8230;for you will not remember it&#8230;”</strong> in <em>Shu’b al-Eemaan</em> as the <u>h</u>adeeth of ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared that particular narration weak in <em>Da`eef al-Jaami` W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-<em>Kursee</em> (the Footstool), Ibn Abee <u>H</u>aatim reported in his Tafseer from Muqaatil that he said in explanation of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p> <strong>كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ</strong> &#8211; 28:88</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Everything will perish except for Allaah’s Face. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Qasas (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All the living things in particular from the inhabitants of the heavens and the angels and whoever is upon the earth and all animals; all living things and then the heavens and the earth will be destroyed after that and Paradise and the Fire will not be destroyed and whatever is within them nor the Throne and nor the Footstool.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy then he declared this narration <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak) in his checking of <em>Mishkaat </em>in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em> <u>h</u>adeeth 5,319 because of the weakness of its narrator Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Maryam al-Ghassaanee, <em>W`Allaahu A’lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Famous narration from `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar meaning to the end of what’s reported.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 36 : Point 49</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger cannot lawfully be shed except on account of one of three matters; fornication after having been married or one who turned apostate after having <em>daleel</em> or one who murders a believing soul without right then he is executed for it, other than that then the blood of the Muslim is unlawful for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F375298469&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-blood-of-a-muslim-cannot-lawfully-be-shed-except-on-account-of-one-of-three-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of killing a Muslim comes after the issue of marriage because Islaam came to protect matters of honour and to protect blood from being shed and to protect property. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Your blood and your wealth and your honour are forbidden for you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim; his blood and his property and his honour.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having spoken about <em>al-a`raa<u>d</u></em> (matters of honour) in the previous sentences in what is connected to marriage and divorce, he moved onto the matter of preservation of blood from being shed. So, the Muslim when he bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then his blood and his property become forbidden to shed. And therefore, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So, if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property safeguarded from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah, the Most High</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever announces his Islaam and utters the two testifications then we accept that from him and we count him as being a Muslim and we apply the rulings of the Muslims upon him even if in his heart there is hypocrisy (<em>nifaaq)</em>, for that will be between him and Allaah. Allaah will bring Him to account and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>accepted Islaam of the hypocrites (<em>munaafiqeen)</em> and he applied the outward rulings upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever commits one of those things that nullifies Islaam then in that case he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy). So, either he will then repent or otherwise, he will be executed as a protection for the religion. This is the <strong>first matter</strong> that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second matter</strong> from those things that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed is <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing); <em>an-nafsu bin-nafs</em> (a life for a life).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh you who believe <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (legal retribution) for those who have been murdered is prescribed for you. The free person for the free person and the slave for the slave and the female for the female and whoever pardons and overlooks for his brother and accepts payment of blood money instead then this should be adhered to with fairness and payment of blood money should be made in a good manner. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. So, whoever then transgresses after acceptance of the blood money and kills the murderer then for him there will be a painful punishment. And there is for you in <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(legal retribution) the saving of life, O people of understanding, that you may become righteous</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 178-179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) results in the preservation of life even though the murderer is killed because a would-be murderer, if he knows that he’s going to be killed, he will withhold from killing. And the rest of the people, if they see the murderer being killed then they will stop themselves from killing. So therefore, blood will be safeguarded on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) is a means for preservation of life and even though the one upon whom retribution is taken is killed then it is a killing which leads to preservation of life of the rest of the society and transgression against blood will be reduced. As for the case, if the murderer were to be left and it were to be said this contradicts human rights and he were to be left and not executed then this will result in the shedding of blood and destruction of security and causing those people who are in a state of security to instead be in fear and it will bring about many evils and killing will increase and bloodshed will occur to the extent that they used to say even in the times of ignorance (<em>jaahiliyyah),</em> “<strong>Execution is the best deterrent to murder</strong>.” So, killing the criminal is the best deterrent to murder in the future and in this regard is the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is for you in legal retribution the saving of life, O people of understanding.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who say that <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing) runs contrary to human rights then we say to them that the person who’s being transgressed against, “Is he not a human?” So, in taking retribution, there is protection for his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>third</strong> of those whose blood it is lawful to shed is the <em>thayyib</em> (one who’s married or has been married) who commits zina (fornication). <em>Ath-thayyib</em> is the person who has had sexual relations with his wife in a correct marriage. So, if he then after that commits <em>zinaa</em> (fornication) then he is stoned to death with stones until he dies and his blood is rendered lawful on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, these are the matters which render the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed. Either <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution for murder) a life for a life or one who commits fornication after being married or <em>al-murtadd</em> (the apostate); the one who has left the religion of Islaam, the one who commits something, which breaks a person’s Islaam. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever changes his religion then kill him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And the one who abandons his religion and leaves the Jama’ah (united body).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who deny the punishment for apostasy seeking to use as evidence his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is to be no compulsion upon the religion.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this use of evidence is an error because killing the apostate; it&#8217;s goal is not to force anyone to accept the religion. Rather, the goal from it is <strong>to protect the religion</strong> from being played around with by someone who has entered into it freely by choice and then he abandons it after having borne witness that the religion is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the blood of a Muslim person who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is not permissible,” </strong>the Muslim is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. However, along with the two testifications, there must be action that he establishes the prayer and gives the <em>Zakaah</em> and fasts Rama<u>d</u>aan and performs the <u>H</u>ajj to the house for whoever is able to make his way to it; action is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whatever is besides that then the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established,” </strong>the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim. There will not come a time when it is permissible for him to shed the blood of a Muslim ever for Allaah unless he transgresses against and attacks the people in their homes or he commits Highway robbery or revolts against the authority of the ruler or other than that then he is killed to repel his evil if his evil cannot be repelled except through killing him.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his famous book <em>Al-Mughnee</em>,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Imaam an-Nawawi mentioned in his explanation of Muslim in the book <em>Kitaab al-Imaarah</em> (Book of Leadership) when he’s speaking about the <u>h</u>adeeth of Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> sending of Aboo Moosaa al-Ash’aree to Yemen then later on he sent Mu`aadh to go to Yemen after him so when Mu`aadh arrived, he found that there’s a Jewish man there captured who had accepted Islaam and then left Islaam and become a Jew again; he was awaiting execution. So Aboo Moosaa offered a cushion for Mu`aadh to sit down so Mu’aadh refused, “till you kill him”. Imaam an-Nawawi commented upon that <u>h</u>adeeth and said, <span style="color:#993300;">“It shows the obligation of killing the apostate and they are agreed in consensus upon his killing.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn `Abdul-Barr said in his book <em>At-Tamheed</em> when he was speaking about the narration of `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em> when he killed the apostates. Ibn `Abdul-Barr then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The <em>fiqh</em> of this <u>h</u>adeeth is that whoever apostasizes (leaves his religion) then his blood becomes lawful and his neck is struck, meaning he’s beheaded and the ummah is united upon that.”<em> </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 35 : Point 48</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him and she will not be permissible for him unless she marries another man.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F375231515&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/if-a-man-divorces-his-wife-three-times-then-she-has-become-forbidden-for-him" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him,” </strong>if a man divorces his wife three times (three separate times divorces) then she becomes forbidden for him by consensus (<em>ijmaa`)</em> just as if he were to say “you are divorced” <strong>then</strong> afterwards he says “you are divorced” and <strong>then</strong> he says “you are divorced” or if he says to his wife “you are divorced <strong>then</strong> divorced or and so divorced” because this indicates a sequence and she becomes irrevocably divorced and separated from him if the number of divorces reaches three and she becomes forbidden for him unless and until she has married another husband besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَن يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ &#8211; 2:229</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ ۗ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَن يَتَرَاجَعَا إِن ظَنَّا أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ &#8211; 2:230</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Divorce is twice then you may either retain her upon reasonable terms or release her in a good manner.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if then he divorces her for the third time then she is not permissible for him after that unless and until she has married another husband besides him. And if he (second husband) then divorces her, in that case there is no harm if the two of them wish to reunite provided that they think they can establish the limits laid down by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 229-230)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is if the divorces are separate even if it is within a single sitting but as for a person who says “you are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced” without a word of adding in between, in this case we examine if he intended by repeating it just to emphasise it then it will be a single divorce but if he was intending establishing that he wanted to divorce her three times then she will be irrevocably divorced from him if it reaches the third one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the divorces are said with a single word such as his saying “you are divorced three times over” or “you are divorced three times” then the majority hold that it counts as three divorces and she becomes separate irrevocably from him and forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him. And this is the position of the four Imaams but in the saying of some of the verifiers that the three is counted only as one divorce and the matter; there is prolonged disagreement with regards to it. However, what will suffice us is that we know that divorce three times over makes her forbidden for him not forever more but rather it makes her forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him and then he divorces her in that case. But as for entering into matters of disagreement then this does not concern us at the moment. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intent of the author in entering these matters in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and Allaah knows best, is to make clear that the matter of marriage is an important matter, which is obligatory to give care and attention to in accordance with legislated principles for it so that people should not be lax about it and about its legal procedures and because the book is entitled <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em>; literally ’An Explanation of the Sunnah’ meaning clarification of the Sunnah in every matter and from that is the issues of marriage.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: People of Knowledge make clear the woman marrying her second husband from the authentic evidences, has to be correct in marrying the second husband, not just as a trick to try and get back to the first one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying, <strong>“So</strong> <strong>if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him and she will not be permissible for him unless she marries another husband besides him,” </strong>this matter, there is a great disagreement about it amongst the scholars. The majority hold that if a man divorces his wife three times at once with a single saying then she becomes forbidden for him; divorced from him. Whereas, from the People of Knowledge, there are some who say that the divorce, which makes her forbidden, is the divorce in accordance with the Sunnah that he divorces her in a period that is free from menses and he has not had sexual relations with her. So, as for divorcing three times with a single word then it is counted as one and a middle and balanced saying is that it’s counted still as three in accordance with his intention and the matter, there is a great deal of speech about it and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 35 : Point 47</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And there is no marriage except with a guardian (<em>walee)</em> and two just witnesses and a dower (<em>sadaaq)</em> whether it be a small amount or a large amount. And whoever does not have a guardian then the ruler is the guardian for one who does not have a guardian (<em>walee</em>)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-marriage-except-with-a-guardian-two-just-witnesses-a-dower" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>fiqh</em> issue and it is an explanation of the conditions for the correctness of marriage (<em>nikaah)</em> with the <em>jumhoor</em> (majority) of scholars and from them is that it should be along with the permission of the <em>walee </em>(guardian) and that a woman may not marry herself off and from its conditions is <em>al</em> <em>ish</em>&#8211;<em>haad</em> (to have witnesses) to the contracting of the marriage. So, a marriage may not be contracted in secret without witnesses. So, from the position of the Muslims is to openly announce marriage and the matter of the <em>walee</em> (having a guardian) is a point where there is some disagreement. The <em>jumhoor</em> (great majority) hold that having the <em>walee </em>(guardian) is essential whereas with the <em>Hanafees</em>, there is no harm in a woman marrying herself off without the permission of the guardian. However, this is a saying that is not the correct saying, it is contrary to the evidence because of his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the other <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry off herself, for the fornicatress (the one who commits zina, fornication) is the one who marries herself off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whichever woman gets married without the permission of her guardian then her marriage is invalid, invalid, invalid.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though some of the jurists declare it to be correct (meaning a woman getting married without the permission of her guardian; <em>walee</em>) based upon <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving) from that scholar then what is counted is the evidence and therefore the author stated this matter even though it is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> to make clear that this is the correct position and it is the position which the majority of the People of Knowledge were upon that which is proven by the Prophetic Sunnah and in order that the marriages of the Muslims should be correctly regulated and not be entered upon by secrecy and <em>i<u>h</u>tiyaalaat</em> (fraudulent tricks). Rather they should be clear and open for indeed marriages are from the most important of affairs because upon them families are built and from them offspring are produced and upon them lineages are built and something even more severe is built upon them rendering the private parts lawful. So, therefore it is essential that the legislated principles are applied to contract a marriage as occurs in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> and in the <em>aayahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And it should be with a <em>sadaaq </em>(dower) and with a dower whether it’s a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>as for the <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then it is not a condition (<em>shar<u>t)</u></em>. However, it is <em>waajib</em> (obligation). And therefore, if the marriage were to be contracted without a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then the contracting of the marriage will be correct. However, a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) will be appointed for her in accordance with that of women who are like her because this is a right of hers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) then the ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian,” </strong>having a <em>walee</em> (guardian) is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>walee</em> (guardian) is the wife’s close male relatives; the closest and then the next closest from them. Firstly, her father then her grandfather and so on upwards and then her son and the son of her son and so on downwards and then her full brother and then her brother through her father; meaning her brother who shares the same father but the mother is different and then her full paternal uncle and then her uncle who is the brother of her father and then the son of her full uncle (son of the father’s brother) and then the son of her uncle who is the brother of her father. This is the guardian (<em>walee)</em> of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it occurs that a woman does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) from her close male relatives then her guardianship is taken on by the ruler or the one who represents the ruler and he is the judge in the court. So marriage must have regulating principles and it may not be anarchy just in accordance with the desires and lusts of the people. <a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,839 in <em>Irwa al Ghaleel </em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Ad-Daaraqutnee in his <em>Sunan</em> and Al-Bayhaqee in his <em>Sunan al-Kubraa</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah and it was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in <em>Al-Badr Al-Muneer</em> to the standard of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of Ibn Maajah declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for the sentence about <em>az</em>&#8211;<em>zaaniyah</em> (fornicatress), the first part being authentic supported by other narrations; <strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry herself off”</strong>, that being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Sharh Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Aa`ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) also by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses with a dower whether it be a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>this is the position of the <em>jumhoor</em> (the great majority) and it is what is the truth. So, therefore, those who say that the woman can marry off herself without the permission of her guardian is a saying, which is false, opposite to the evidences and contrary to them. Indeed, it opens up a breach for the people of corruption. So, it is obligatory to believe that this is futile. And likewise, her getting married without a dower. However, if the dower is not stated at the marriage then what is correct is that it does not make it null and void and is still counted as a valid marriage but she should be given a dower the same as women who are like her and her close relatives and women of her age; meaning the dower that is well-known amongst the people, whether it be a small amount or a large amount, at that time and at that place and this woman is called <em>Anwalliyah</em>; one who has given up the affair to someone else with the jurists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Whoever</strong><strong> does not have a guardian then the ruler is the guardian for one who has no guardian; a <em>walee</em>,” </strong>this is the correct saying. So the woman who does not have a guardian then her guardian will be the ruler because of the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the evidences with regard to the necessity of having a <em>walee</em> that brings some of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur·aan, each of the <em>aayahs</em> that they bring Sooratun-Noor (24) <em>aayah</em> 32, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 221, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 232, each of them in an address with regard to marrying the women and the address with regard to marrying off is the addresses to the men; men marrying off the women as opposed to an address to the women looking to get married. With regard to the point where the Shaykh mentioned that a woman getting married without any guardian and saying that it’s permissible for a woman to marry herself off without any guardian, this opens up a door to people who want to cause corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they mention in the footnote, Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee himself he said, “I myself heard that there was one of the jurists from the <em>Hanafee’s</em> in one of the Arab lands and he had a son who was deviant and he used to hear from his father that it is not a condition for marriage that a woman has the permission of her guardian. So, this son when he used to hear that, used to accompany a group of people who were evildoers and they used to do illicit sexual acts with the women. He taught theevil group that what they should do is say to the prostitute woman, when you go to pay her you should say, “marry yourself to me” and she should say “I marry myself to you” and he should say “I accept it” and then when he’s finished his night with her then you say to her “you’re divorced” and on the second night, you can do it with a different woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh said, “So you can see that this <em>madhab</em> has been used here contrary to the evidence as a means for causing corruption even though the <em>Hanafee</em> <em>madhab</em> itself does not make the like of this permissible. However, it makes permissible only a marriage, which is going to be permanent and it does not make permissible mixing waters of one man with another when divorced. Rather, there must be an `<em>iddah</em> (waiting period) making sure her womb is clear, even a woman who frees herself by <em>khulah</em> or a slave girl who is poor.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 46</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to occur from the start of time and whatever was not going to occur. Whatever was going to happen then Allaah fully comprehended and enumerated it.

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to affirm the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and its encompassing everything. So, He has full knowledge of everything and He has full ability over everything and His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) has no beginning and no ending. His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) is just like the rest of the attributes established for Him forever. So, just as Allaah has no beginning then likewise, there is no beginning for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Perfect and Most High. And just as Allaah has no end, then likewise there is no end for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, He along with His names and His attributes is the First One with no beginning and He along with His names and His attributes is the Last One with no ending just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said addressing his Lord, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You are Al-Awwal (the First One) so there is nothing before You and<br />
You are  Al-Aakhir (the Last One) so there is nothing after You and<br />
You are Az-Zaahir (the Uppermost One) so there is nothing above You and<br />
You are <em>Al-Baatin</em> (the Closest One) so there is nothing closer than You.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to be from the start of time and whatever was not going to be and whatever exists, He enumerated it and comprehended it all,” </strong>Allaah knew whatever was and has passed away in previous time and He knows whatever will be in the future and He knows whatever will not be, if it were to be; how it will be. So, Allaah’s knowledge comprehends everything and therefore He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَوْ رُدُّوا لَعَادُوا لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">If they were to be sent back, they will return to doing whatever they had been forbidden from.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah knew that if they were to be returned to the world, they would return to doing what they had been forbidden from, meaning if they were returned to the world then they would return to disbelief even though their returning to the world would never happen ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever says that He does not know except what has already occurred or what is occurring then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous,” </strong>whoever restricts the knowledge of Allaah to events that have already occurred only and that He does not know what is going to occur before it actually happens then he has disbelieved in Allaah because he has denied the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and he has denied the comprehensiveness of the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and He has affirmed for Allaah deficient knowledge so he becomes a disbeliever on account of this, for the knowledge of Allaah cannot be restricted. As for the knowledge of the created being then it is restricted no matter what level it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And above every person possessing knowledge there is one who knows more.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person who has knowledge, there will be another person who knows more than him and above all of them is Allaah, the Most High with His knowledge. And He commanded His Messenger to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh my Lord, increase me in knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-<u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah </em>114)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the person who restricts the knowledge of Allaah and says He knows such and such but He does not know such and such, this one is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) since he has belittled Him and denied the generality of His knowledge of everything.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With regard to this sentence, there appears to be something missing in  the wording here and what is apparent that the meaning is <strong>“And He does not know what will be except after it has occurred”</strong> and this was the statement of Hishaam ibn Al-Hakam; the head of misguidance, the one who said Allaah does not know things until they actually happen. So, he clearly stated that He, the Perfect does not know anything until He brings about knowledge for Himself of it and this is clear disbelief. Refer to the book <em>Al-Fissal</em> of Ibn Hazm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I,Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad, say, the saying that “Allaah does not know things until they have actually happened,” this is the saying of some of the Mu`tazilah and it is a false and futile saying. Whoever believes that then he has disbelieved. So, knowledge (<em>al-ilm)</em> is an attribute of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah knew whatever was and whatever will not be and whatever is. If something were to occur, how it will be and He wrote it down in the preserved tablet (a<em>l-Lawh al-Mahfudh)</em> before He created the heavens and the earth. So, therefore, whoever denies <em>al-ilm (</em>Allaah’s knowledge) then he is a disbeliever. It’s obligatory that his repentance should be sought and he’ll either repent or he’ll be executed for disbelief and apostasy. And the Salaf (predecessors) said with regard to the <em>Qadariyyah</em>, “Argue with them concerning Allaah’s knowledge for if they deny it, they are disbelievers.” And success is granted by Allaah.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 45</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that reptiles, beasts of prey and all creatures such as the tiniest ant, flies and bees are all acting as they have been commanded and they not do anything except with the permission of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the creation is under orders relating to the creation. The sun proceeds and the moon proceeds and the stars and the planets orbit and the creatures and the bird, everything proceeds upon the order that Allaah has decreed for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِي أَعْطَىٰ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 20:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He gave everything its due form and nature and created an appropriate mate for it and then He guided it to acquiring its benefit. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 50)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He ordered the whole of this worldly life and whatever is within it from existing things and beings and planets and heavens and the earth, all of them proceed in accordance with preordainment and predecree of the Creator, the Perfect and Most High and they comply with His commands relating to the creation.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</strong> &#8211; 36:82</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></strong> (Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah</em> 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they precede and pass along in accordance with the command of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and in accordance with His pre-decree and His creation and His will and His wish in submission to Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Each running its course for an appointed time.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ra`d (13), <em>aayah</em> 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they not do anything except with the permission of Allaah, the Most High,” </strong>meaning with the permission of Allaah relating to the creation and it is <em>al-amrul kowniyy</em> (His creational command) and the <em>mashee-ah</em> (His wish), Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So, they do not proceed on the basis of their own desires or upon control from someone besides Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and therefore when the tyrant king said to Ibraheem `<em>alayhissalaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِي حَاجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِي يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِي وَأُمِيتُ ۖ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ &#8211; 2:258</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I give life and cause death.&#8221; Ibrahim (Abraham) said, &#8220;Verily! Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west.&#8221; So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allah guides not the people, who are Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc.). </span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 258)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the actions of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no one is able to do them or to copy them. So, He is the one who controls the creation, He, the Perfect and Most High and He orders it in the best and most precise arrangement, it does not alter and it does not change.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ</strong> &#8211; 67:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not see any gap in that which the Most Merciful has created.</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Mulk (67), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the sun and the moon and the stars and the heavens and the earth since Allaah created them until Allaah wishes the end of this world, they proceed in accordance with the pre-decreed and divinely arranged order that does not change and does not alter.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These created beings, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High created them and for each one of them He appointed <em>ibaadah</em> (worship). So, each one of these creatures and wild animals and reptiles and other than that each one of them carries our <em>ibaadah</em> (worship); the worship that it is being commanded with. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَالطَّيْرُ صَافَّاتٍ ۖ كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلَاتَهُ وَتَسْبِيحَهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you not see that Allaah, whoever is within the heavens and the earth declare His Perfection and the birds spreading their wings. Each one knows its own prayer and glorification of Him and Allaah knows whatever they do and to Allaah belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and return will be to Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Noor (24), <em>aayah</em> 41-42)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this <em>aayah,</em> we know that these creatures and birds have different types of worship for which Allaah created them and they carry them out in compliance with command of their Lord. They do not do anything from themselves and Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 44</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And reflecting about Allaah is an innovation because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Reflect upon the creation and do not reflect upon Allaah because reflecting about the Lord casts doubt into the heart.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374566673&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-obligatory-to-avoid-reflecting-upon-the-self-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory upon the Muslim to avoid reflecting upon the Self of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and reflecting upon how (<em>kayfiyyah)</em>, how of His names and attributes and actions? Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He, Allaah knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and to venerate the Lord, the Perfect and Most High without reflecting upon His Self and how His names and attributes are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> reflect upon the things created by Allaah and upon the signs Allaah has put in the creation (<em>aayaat ul-kowniyyah)</em>.This will indicate to you the power of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions some lines of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>&#8220;So how can the One truly worshipped be disobeyed </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>or how can the denier deny Him when in everything </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>there is a sign for him proving that He is one.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should reflect upon the signs within the creation, in the heavens and the earth and the mountains and the rocks and the trees and the oceans and the created beings to derive proof from them for the tremendousness of the Creator, the Perfect and Most High and reflect upon the <em>aayahs</em> of Allaah in the Qur&#8217;aan. But as for your reflecting upon Allaah’s Self and how His names and attributes are, then you will not be able to reach that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they do not encompass Him with knowledge.<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">H</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 110)</span><a style="font-size:1rem;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in his book <em>Al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> and also by al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool al-I’tiqaad</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar and the reality is some of the verifiers point out of those books that the chain of narration of that <u>h</u>adeeth is weak there and the <u>h</u>adeeth is also reported though by Aboo Shaykh in his book <em>Al-Adama</em> and by Abul Qaasim al-Asbahaaniyy in his book <em>At</em>&#8211;<em>Targheeb</em> as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and this <u>h</u>adeeth was declared to be <em>hasan</em> (good) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy due to its having a number of narrations of support also from  a narration of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and so on. At the end Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned the different narrations. In summary, he said in <em>As-Saheehah</em> no. 1,788, “The <u>h</u>adeeth when its chain of narrations gathered is <em>hasan</em> (good) in my view and Allaah knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:  <em>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</em> The verifier of the book mentioned that the <u>h</u>adeeth has some weakness in it and he mentioned that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth as being a <u>h</u>adeeth that is <em>hasan</em> (good) due to supports and he gave the reference for that. I (Shaykh Ahmad)  say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <u>h</u>adeeth, its authentication needs examination and it may be the case that it is the speech of some of the Salaf and I say that reflecting upon Allaah meaning with regard to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic’s Self, this is not befitting because a servant if he thinks, he reflects then he will only think and reflect based upon what his intellect pictures and based upon what crosses his mind with regard to things that he’s actually seen or heard or known whereas Allaah, the Perfect and Most High is above all of that. So, it is not befitting that anyone reflects upon His Self, He, the Most High because whenever a person imagines something then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will be contrary to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What will suffice us is to reflect upon Allaah’s creation and with regard to His tremendous and amazing ability and if a person were to reflect upon his own origin that will suffice him. So, let him reflect upon how Allaah caused that sperm drop to change, which He created him from into this tremendous being. How Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic changed that sperm drop from which He created an animal; one animal from another animal and how Allaah prepared everything from the created beings for that which He intended from it. So, Allaah prepared the cows for cultivation and He prepared the camels for carrying and so on and so forth as we can see and as we know. So, the One who is able to change that sperm drop into a person and a different one into an animal, is He not the Lord who has full ability over everything? Yes indeed and we bear witness over that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, what is important is that reflection should be upon the creation of Allaah not about His Self</strong> and let us read the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is obligatory upon us to submit to this <em>aayah</em> so that our minds do not stumble into things that are not befitting and if it is the case that Paradise contains things that no eye has ever seen and no ear has ever heard of nor have ever crossed the heart, never crossed the mind of any human and it is a created thing created by Allaah then how about the Self of Allaah? And success is granted by Allaah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 43</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>ومن زعم أنه يرى ربه في دار الدنيا فهو كافر بالله عز وجل</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And whoever claims that he sees his Lord in this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374551685&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-he-saw-his-lord-in-this-world-then-he-is-a-disbeliever-in-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that anyone can see Allaah in this world, seeing Him with their eyes not seeing Him in a dream then he is a disbeliever; <em>kaafir</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High cannot be seen in this world and therefore when <em>kaleemullaah</em>, the one to whom Allaah spoke, Moosa <em>alayhissalam</em>:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي</p>
<p>لَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Moosaa (`<em>alayhissalaam</em>) said, “Oh my Lord, show Yourself to me so that I may look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me, however look at the mountain and if it remains settled at its place then you will see Me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one can see Allaah in this world (<em>dunya)</em>. This is a point of consensus (<em>ijmaa)</em> amongst the scholars. Rather, seeing Allaah will be in the Hereafter because the people in this world are weak, they are not able to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because of their weakness and therefore when Allaah manifested Himself to the mountain, it shattered and became dust. So, how about the son of Aadam who is made of flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for in the Hereafter, Allaah will give to the believers strength through which they will be able to see Allaah and they will delight in seeing Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, seeing Allaah in the Hereafter is established and is <em>mutawaatir</em> (quoted by a huge number of people at each level of transmission) is established for the believers. But as for in this world then no one will see Allaah with His eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disagree whether the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw Him on the night of the ascent through the Heavens or did not see Him. And what is correct or the great majority are upon is that the Messenger did not see Him with His eye but rather, he saw Him with his heart and with his insight because no one can see Allaah in this life, because Allah is greater than that anyone should see Him in this life and therefore when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Did you see your Lord on the night of the ascent (mi`raaj), ascent through the Heavens?” He said, “Noorun Anna Araahu.” (Light, how could I see Him?) ”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim <u>h</u>adeeth no. (178) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> that the Prophet responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Light, how could I see Him?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“His screen is light, if He were to uncover it then the shining light of His face would consume whatever his gaze came upon from His creation.</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>H</u>adeeth also reported by Muslim (179) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author,  &#8216;<em>Whoever claims that he can see His Lord in the life of this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;</em>.  I say, this claim has been claimed by many of the <strong>heretic <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who say that they see their Lord and they see the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and take from him and take from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic directly and they believe that they are in a station higher than the station of Messengership and whoever claims this claim then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). There is no doubt about his disbelief and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> likewise mentions the same point that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the claim of the <strong>extreme <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who claim that they can take knowledge directly from Allaah, the Most High by way of Kashf and who claim that they can obtain knowledge of the hidden and unseen (<em>ghaib)</em> directly from Allaah, the Most High, this point refers to the like of them and that claim is disbelief.”</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">وكل ما سمعت من الآثار شيئا مما لم يبلغه عقلك نحو قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلوب العباد بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن عز وجل وقوله إن الله ينزل إلى السماء الدنيا وينزل يوم عرفة وينزل يوم القيامة وإن جهنم لا يزال يطرح فيها حتى يضع عليها قدمه جل ثناؤه وقول الله تعالى للعبد إن مشيت إلي هرولت إليك وقوله خلق الله آدم على صورته وقول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي في أحسن صورة وأشباه هذه الأحاديث فعليك بالتسليم والتصديق والتفويض والرضا ولا تفسر شيئا من هذه بهواك فإن الإيمان بهذا واجب فمن فسر شيئا من هذا بهواه ورده فهو جهمي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And whenever you hear something from the narrations, which your intellect cannot fully comprehend such as the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and His saying:</span>  <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allaah descends to the lowest heaven and He descends on the Day of `Arafah and He will descend on the Day of Resurrection and that the Hellfire will continue to have people cast into it until He, the Majestic and Praise will place His foot upon it”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and the saying of Allaah the Most High to the servant: </span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“if you come towards Me walking, I will comes towards you running.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His saying <strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon His image.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the most excellent form” </strong></span><span style="color:#993300;">and the like of these <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then upon you is to submit and to believe and to consign the how to Allaah and to be pleased and do not explain anything from this based upon your desires since having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory so whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a <em>Jahmee</em>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts of the <em>sifaat</em> (attributes) that are established for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them just as they come upon their reality without interfering with them with your intellect and saying this does not befit Allaah. Allaah is declared free of that and this is resemblance; <em>tashbeeh</em>, as is said by the <em>Mu’attilah</em>; deniers of the attributes or that you believe that Allaah resembles His creation as is said by the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who declare the Creator to be like the creation. So each of the two groups are upon misguidance.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Mu`attilah</em>;</strong> those who deny the attributes, they went beyond the limit in <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Allaah free) to such an extent that they denied the names and attributes in order to flee away from <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) they claimed.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mumaththilah</em>;</strong> those who liken Allaah to the creation, they went beyond the limit in affirming to such an extent that they likened Allaah to His creation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Both of these positions are <em>baatil</em> (false and futile).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the position of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is <em>al-wasa<u>t</u></em> (the middle and justly balanced position), they affirm the names and attributes for Allaah with affirmation without <em>tashbeeh</em> (without likening Allaah to the creation) and they negate from Him any resemblance to a created being declaring Him free of imperfections but without denying the attributes. This is the position of the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah W`al Jama`ah</em>. In accordance with His saying He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who liken Allaah to the creation, <strong>“there is nothing like Him.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He, Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mu`attilah</em>; those who deny the attributes and the <em>aayah</em> proves that affirming the names and attributes does not necessitate <em>tashbeeh </em>(resemblance) to the creation nor <em>tamtheel </em>(His being like) the creation and the fact that the people affirm whatever attributes He has affirmed for Himself or His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, we affirm those attributes and that in no way necessitates that we have likened Him to the creation or declared Him to be resemblance to the creation. This is the correct methodology with regard to the matter of <em>Al-Asma Wa-Sifaat</em> (names and the attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like such as <strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> you should affirm <em>a<u>s</u>aabi`</em> (the fingers) for the Most Merciful as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth and you should not say that they are like the fingers of the created being for this is <em>tashbeeh</em> (likening) Him to the creation, we declare Allaah free of it. Rather, we affirm it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High not like the fingers of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we affirm the <em><u>H</u>adeeth Qudsee</em> in which Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever comes to me walking, I come to him running.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning whoever hastens towards My pleasure and towards obedience to Me then I will hasten to forgive his sins and to carry out his needs. so the meaning of <em>harwalah</em> (running) is not the meaning that is well-known with us but rather it is explained by the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth by His saying, <strong>“If he were to ask Me, I would certainly give to him and if he were to ask My refuge, I would certainly grant him refuge.” </strong>So, the meaning of <em>al-harwalah</em> here is hastening to carry out the needs of His servant just as the servant hastens to the obedience to Allaah. So, does the servant run in reality or in meaning?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains a refutation of some of those who are overhasty in affirming <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) for Allaah and this is the case of actions which are done as a response just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ ۙ سَخِرَ اللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So they (the disbelievers) mock at the believers, Allaah will mock at them.</span></strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah</em> 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p>
<p>اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say, “We were only mocking.” Allaah will mock them.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 14-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plotted and Allaah planned.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to have awareness of these tremendous principles so that a person may be upon clear insight and be aware of the position of the <em><strong>Salaf</strong> </em>with regard to it; those who are more firmly grounded than you and had more knowledge than you and a person should not try and make himself independent with his own understanding and his own intellect and affirm for Allaah things that he does not know about based upon what is apparent or based upon some unclear things, when there are decisive evidences, which explain and clarify them. So, it is obligatory to refer that which is unclear back to that which is clear and only those who are firmly grounded in knowledge will be guided to doing this. So, it is obligatory upon the student of knowledge and the beginner that he should not be hasty in these matters. Rather, he should withhold with regard to them and he should learn how he is to understand them upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf </em>and upon the clear, correct way. The <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) did not fall short in making the truth clear and in laying down principles and regulations. However, this requires learning and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this also is his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And He descends on the evening of Arafah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they but await that Allaah should come to them screened by clouds and the angels come and the affair will be finished and to Allaah return all affairs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise with regard to Allaah, the Most High’s coming on the Day of Resurrection, it occurs also as a side point in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection to carry out judgement upon His servants.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We affirm these matters for Allaah upon their reality (<em><u>h</u>aqeeqah)</em> without interfering by defining the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). So, we do not burden ourselves with awareness of how He will descend and how He will come. So, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how), we do not enter into it but as for the meaning then it is <em>ma’qool</em> (understood) and therefore, when Imaam Maalik was asked about how <em>al-istiwaa</em>; how the ascending is when the questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner said to Imaam Maalik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How did He ascend?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asking about <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said to him:</p>
<p><strong>الاستواء معلوم</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ascending is known.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning known with regard to its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik said:</p>
<p><strong>والكيف مجهول , والإيمان به واجب , والسؤال عنه بدعة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And how is unknown and having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking about it is bid’ah (innovation).” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the sound methodology in the like of these affairs.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">soorah</span></em> (a form) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic in his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon his image.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Upon the form of the Most Merciful one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we affirm <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (a form or image) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic just as His Messenger affirmed it for Him in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the best form.”</strong></span> <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e this was in the world seeing Him in a dream in the best form. It contains affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (form or image) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High as befits His Majesty, not like the images of the created beings but rather, it is the <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (image or form) of the Most Merciful, the Majestic and Most High. So, these matters, we affirm them and we do not enter into them nor raise doubts about them nor delve further into them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>We consign or surrender the matter,” </strong>what is correct is to perform <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the <em>kayfiyyah</em></span> (how) it is, not <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Do not explain anything from these with your desires,”</strong> rather you must explain them with the correct meaning that befits Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. It should not be said that they are not to be explained. Rather, they are to be explained and their meaning is to be made clear and <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (surrender, consigning) is just with regard to how only. So, therefore you affirm <em>an-nuzool</em> (His descending) but you negate the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High comes on the Day of Resurrection to carry out the judgement just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah comes to them screened by clouds and the angels and the affair is concluded.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect will come to carry out judgement upon His servants. However, it is not like the coming of the created being and the coming of one of the creation. Rather, it is coming as befits His Majesty however He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>You should not explain any of this <em>Bi Hawaaka</em> (with your desires),” </strong>meaning do not explain them without knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> but as for your explaining them as necessitated by the evidences and referring that which is unclear back to that which is clear then there is no harm in it. But as for a person who is a beginner or an ignorant person then he should not enter into these very grave matters and these tremendous matters because this is a mistake and something very dangerous and I see many of the youth who feign knowledge being bold upon the matters of <em>`aqeedah</em> and they start to derive things from them and to speak about them and then they have enmity towards each other based upon these things and they break ties with each other when they disagree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, oh brothers, Allaah did not burden us with these matters. Upon you is to proceed upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf</em> and to say what they said. The books of <em>`aqeedah</em> are precisely written and all praise is for Allaah and printed and corrected and being studied and carefully checked so do not introduce things from yourselves and understandings from yourselves, you have been  sufficed having to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory,”</strong> having <em>eemaan</em> in the names of Allaah and attributes and His actions is obligatory. It is obligatory upon the servant and from having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is to have <em>eemaan</em> in His names and His attributes as befits His Majesty, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, the person who interferes in the matters of names and attributes, either with <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation) or with <em>tamtheel </em>(likening the Creator to the creation) or with <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (claiming ignorance about the meaning) or by bringing explanation from himself then this person has not believed in Allaah with true and full <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, his <em>eemaan</em> is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>So, whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a Jahmee,” </strong>the Jahmiyyah negated the names and attributes because they explain them in accordance with what befits the created being. There is no doubt that Allaah is declared free of that which befits the created being. So, they <strong>initially</strong> likened Him and then <strong>secondly</strong>, they negated based upon their <em>tamtheel</em> (having likened Him to the creation) since nothing was apparent to them from these texts except that which resembles the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore they denied them on account of that but as for if they had just said these texts contain attributes and names of Allaah in reality, that they are as befit Him, they are not like the names of the created beings nor like the attributes of the created beings, if they’d just followed this methodology, they would have been safe and sound but they were afflicted on account of their understanding and their desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Jahmiyyah, this is an ascription to Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan at-Tirmidhiyy or As-Samar Qandee, this well-known deviant, ascribed to the town of Tirmidh or the area of Samar Qand and he was the first one who manifested the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created and who had the saying that the names and the attributes are to be negated and who said that <em>eemaan</em> is just merely awareness in the heart to the rest of his sayings of misguidance and disbelief. So, whoever holds this belief then he is ascribed to him or it is to be said this person is a Jahmee in ascription to Al-Jahm.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Part of a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (2,654) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (7,405) and Muslim (2,675) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Whether <em>ar-harwalah</em> (running) is to be understood literally or it’s to be explained as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned in the likes of what occurs at the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth then as Shaykh al-Fowzaan <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, <span style="font-size:1rem;">This is also what was said by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Majmoo` al-Fataawa</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> and likewise you’ll find in the explanation of Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh upon </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> of Ibn Taymeeyah, the same explanation, he explained it that here in this particular hadeeth </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">al-harwalah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> means </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;">Allaah, the Most High’s hastening to carry out the needs of His servant and to forgive him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are others from the People of Knowledge who affirm <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) as an attribute for Allaah, the Most High as is apparent. From them was Imaam Ad-Daranee in his refutation of Al-Mareesee. Likewise, from the present day scholars Shaykh bin Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his <em>fataawa</em>; <em>Fataawa Noor `Alaa al-Darb</em>. Likewise, Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen in his fataawa and in his fataawa of al-`aqeedah in his book <em>Al-Qawaa`id al-Muthlaa</em> and Shaykh `Ubayd in his explanation, he agreed with that as well. Likewise, the <em>Saudi Lajna</em> also and likewise, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em>Silsilatul Huda Wan-Noor</em> tape series, all of them affirming this as an attribute for Allaah as befits His Majesty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation &#8211; &#8220;So, the <em>Salaf</em> had a great deal of speech concerning it, however, what has most right in the matter is that we should have eemaan in it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, meaning we affirm it as an attribute for Allaah as it stands and it is a proof for His responding to His creation, we affirm the attribute and what’s necessitated by the attribute is that Allaah indeed responds to His creation. So what is indicated by the attribute and its affect is His reward. So affirming the attribute <em>ar-harwalah</em> has more right than the saying of those who say that it means giving reward alone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (6,321) and Muslim (758) from Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Reported by Muslim (1,348) from `Aa`ishah that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no day when Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the day of Arafah and He indeed draws close then He boasts about them to the angels and says “what do those people want?”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (806) and Muslim (182), a long <u>h</u>adeeth containing the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And Allaah will come to them, He, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come and the angels in ranks.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> in his explanation mentioned a number of attributes and he applied the same principle to each one with regard to Allaah’s hand for example, he says, “The hand the meaning is known, the how is unknown, having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking how is an innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (6,227) and reported by Muslim (2,841) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer</em> and by Al-Haarith ibn `Abee Usaamah in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Ibn Khuzaymah in <em>Kitaab at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and it was declared authentic by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahaweyh as occurs in <em>Meezaan al-I’tidaal</em> of Imaam a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>Th</u>ahabiyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge such as Ibn Khuzaymah and some others declare this wording to be weak and likewise Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared this wording weak in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em>, <u>h</u>adeeth number 1,176 because of four weaknesses in the chain of narration. Ibn Khuzaymah himself pointed out three of the weaknesses and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentions the 4<sup>th</sup> weakness as well, Allaahu `Aalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and it should be volume 5, page 243 and by At-Tirmidhiyy in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mu`aadh <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it was declared authentic by At-Tirmidhiyy and he mentioned Al-Bukhaariyy declared it authentic also and likewise it was declared  <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> <strong>Side Point:</strong> The position of the People of the Sunnah is with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High then we say just as Imaam Maalik said as for the meaning of the attributes then we affirm the meaning but as regards to how the attribute is then we do not know so that is what we consign to Allaah, we give up on that, how it is; we do not know, we leave that to our Lord, Allaahu `Aalam. Whereas, as regards to the <em>Mufawwidah</em>; the deviant group then they  do the <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning i.e  they say we don’t know what the meaning is.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 32 : Point 41</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>ولا يخرج أحد من أهل القبلة من الإسلام حتى يرد آية من كتاب الله عز وجل أو يرد شيئا من آثار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أو يصلي لغير الله أو يذبح لغير الله وإذا فعل شيئا من ذلك فقد وجب عليك أن تخرجه من الإسلام فإذا لم يفعل شيئا من ذلك فهو مؤمن ومسلم بالاسم لا بالحقيقة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And no one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> leaves Islaam unless he rejects an <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic or rejects anything from the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or praise to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah. So, if he does any of that then it is binding upon you to expel him from Islaam and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374481587&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/no-muslim-exits-islaam-unless-he-perpetrates-that-which-nullifies-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> exits from Islaam except through committing one of the well-known <em>nawaaqid</em> (nullifiers of Islaam) along with any valid excuse being removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or through his rejecting anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, if he denies the Qur&#8217;aan or a part of it or the authentic Sunnah or a part of it or he rebuts anything from the Qur&#8217;aan or rebuts anything from the authentic Sunnah then he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy) because he is denying the truth of what has been said by Allaah and his Messenger as long as he is not <em>jaahil</em> (an ignorant person) or <em>muqallid</em> (someone just blindly following somebody else) or <em>muta`awwil</em> (somebody’s who’s misinterpreting), in which case the matter is made clear to him and when it is made clear to him and if he still persists then he is judged to be guilty of apostasy. And what is meant by <em>aathaar</em> (narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>or he rejects anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, meaning he becomes a disbeliever and this is a tremendous principle with the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. With it they contradict two groups;</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Khawaarij</em></strong> and the extremists, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of <em>kabaa`ir</em> (committing major sins), which are less than shirk and,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Murji`ah</em></strong>, those who say that sin does not harm if a person has <em>eemaan</em> as long as the person is a believer; has eemaan in his heart then no sins will harm him even if he leaves off all actions and does not do any action then he will be a believer (<em>mu`min) </em>who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> <em>W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) then it is just as the author said that they are upon a middle and balanced position between the two groups. So they say that the <em>kabaa`ir </em>(major sins) vary. So, if it something from shirk or major <em>kufr</em> then he exits from the religion by consensus. And as for if it is not <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and if it is not shirk and it is not denying the Book of Allaah nor the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and it is not abandoning the prayer and it is not calling upon other than Allaah or sacrificing for other than Allaah, rather  it is just a major sin, it is less than that then this does not cause a person to exit from Islaam contrary to the <em>Khawaarij </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>. However, it does harm the believer and it will reduce his <em>eemaan</em> contrary to the <em>Murji`ah</em>, those who say that sin does not harm along with <em>eemaan</em>. So, this is the middle position, which harmonises between the texts of <em>Wa’eed (which mention a threat of punishment)</em> and the texts of <em>Wa‘ad</em> ( which mentions a promise of reward)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> took hold of the texts of the threat and they abandoned the texts of promise. Whereas, the <em>Murji’ah</em> did the opposite, they took hold of the texts of promise and they abandoned the texts where there is a threat. So, each of the two groups are <em>daal</em> (astray).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or unless he prays to other than Allaah or he sacrifices for other than Allaah,” </strong>such that he prays towards a grave seeking nearness to it or he makes prostration to an idol or he makes a sacrifice for other than Allaah and does anything from the acts of worship for other than Allaah then this person is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of shirk), <em>a kaafir (</em>disbeliever) outside the religion and whatever is lesser than that then the people of the Sunnah are upon a middle position with regard to him in between the <em>Murji`ah</em> and the <em>Khawaarij</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does anything from that then it becomes binding upon you to expel him from Islaam,”</strong> if he does anything from that, meaning if he prays to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah or does an act of worship for other than Allaah then it is binding upon you to expel him from the religion and it is binding upon you to believe that he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> and you may not say this is not my concern or I don’t know about him. Rather, it is obligatory upon you to declare the disbeliever and the <em>mushrik</em> to be a disbeliever and that you declare the sinner to be a sinner, one who commits a major sin, which is less than shirk. So, the truth about this matter must be made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality,” </strong>meaning with regard to what is apparent with us and his hidden condition is left to Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 40</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>والصلاة على من مات من أهل القبلة سنة والمرجوم والزاني والزانية والذي يقتل نفسه وغيره من أهل القبلة والسكران وغيرهم الصلاة عليهم سنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to pray over whoever dies from the People of the <em>Qiblah </em>is the Sunnah and over the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who commits suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and the drunkard and other than them, the funeral prayer over them is the Sunnah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374257166&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-pray-over-whoever-dies-from-the-people-of-the-qiblah-is-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just as has preceded that whoever manifests <em>eemaan</em> and Islaam, we pray funeral prayer over him and he is from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and they are those who pray towards the <em>Ka’bah (</em>the direction of prayer of the Muslims), those people we deal with them in accordance with what is apparent so we judge them to be Muslims and we treat them as we treat the Muslims whilst they are alive and when they are dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and likewise the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who has committed suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em>”, </strong>the sinful believer who does not exit from Islaam on account of his major sin is treated as a Muslim and supplication is made for him just like the person who commits suicide and just like the one who is stoned for fornication and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed funeral prayer over those who were stoned to death. He prayed over Maa`iz <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and over Al-Ghaamidiyyah; the woman of the Ghaamidiyyah tribe <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would withhold from praying over some people such as the one who committed suicide and such as the person who misappropriated something from the booty in Allaah’s cause in order to discipline the people not because he was a disbeliever and therefore he gave permission to the companions to pray upon him and he did not prevent them from prayer over him because he is still a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the drunkard and other than them, the prayer over them is Sunnah”, </strong>the one who drinks alcohol is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner), the <em><u>h</u>add</em> (prescribed punishment) is established upon him. However, he does not exit from Islaam. So, if he dies then he is prayed over even if he used to drink alcohol because he is still from the People of the <em>Qibla</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>it is the Sunnah”, </strong>meaning it is from the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which it is obligatory to follow.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This incident of Maa`iz with the long story connected to it; he came and he admitted what he had done and sought that he should be stoned to death is reported in Al-Bukhaariyy (6,820) in the book of <em><u>h</u>udood</em> (prescribed punishments), Chapter 25 ‘Stoning to Death at the Mu<u>s</u>allaa (outdoor place of prayer)’ from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> contains the wording there when it mentions his story and that he was stoned to death and then at the end of it occurs that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said with regard to that wording there it is quoted at the end of the narration in a disconnected form and Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said in <em>Irwa</em>` <em>Al Ghalil</em> Volume 7, page 353 that this narration is actually <em>shaaddah</em> (contrary to what’s authentic) that the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself prayed over Maa`iz is contrary to the correct reports. It’s only reported by one narrator Mahmood ibn Gheelaan to the exclusion of all other narrators of this <u>h</u>adeeth and Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar mentions their names in <em>Fathul Baari</em> Volume 12, page 115-116. Likewise, in addition Aboo Daawood reports in his Sunan <u>h</u>adeeth 3,186 from Aboo Burdah Al-Aslami that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not pray over Maa`iz ibn Malik and he did not forbid prayer over him.  Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said this report by Aboo Daawood is hasan, saheeh (good, authentic), Allaahu A’lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> This <u>h</u>adeeth that she was stoned to death and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over her, <u>h</u>adeeth being reported by Muslim (1,695) from <u>h</u>adeeth of Buraydah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author affirming that the prayer is said over all of them, there is <em>taf<u>s</u>eel</em>  (detail) here  that needs to be mentioned, which is that he is to be prayed over by everyone <strong>except for the <em>Imaam</em> (ruler)</strong> because it is not befitting that the ruler should pray over those people so that the sinful people should not become emboldened to commit those sins and crimes. Rather, what is befitting is that they should be deterred from that. So, the ruler should not pray the funeral prayer over them. Rather, his deputy should pray over him so that the people should know that the ruler not praying over those people who have died, they should recognise it, it will be a deterrent for them and the people should recognise how despicable that action is, which has led the ruler to stay back from praying the funeral prayer over him. As for the rest of the nation then they should pray over those people.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 39</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>واعلم بأن الدنيا دار إيمان وإسلام وأمة محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم فيها مؤمنون مسلمون في أحكامهم ومواريثهم وذبائحهم والصلاة عليهم ولا نشهد لأحد بحقيقة الإيمان حتى يأتي بجميع شرائع الإسلام فإن قصر في شيء من ذلك كان ناقص الإيمان حتى يتوب واعلم أن إيمانه إلى الله تعالى تام الإيمان أو ناقص الإيمان إلا ما أظهر لك من تضييع شرائع الإسلام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to rulings, inheritance, slaughtering animals and with regard to praying the funeral prayer over them. And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam. So if he neglects any of that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> until he repents and you should know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High, to judge whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or incomplete in <em>eemaan</em> unless he manifests to you neglect of the Islaamic duties.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/this-world-is-an-abode-of-eemaan-and-islaam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam”, </strong>meaning Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) are in this world; <em>duniya</em>, which is the abode of action. As for the <em>aakhirah</em> (Hereafter) and it is the abode of <em>jazaa </em>(recompense). So Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are to be found in this world. As for one who dies on other than Islaam and eemaan then he is a kaafir, a disbeliever and it will not benefit him, that on the Day of Resurrection when he witnesses that which he disbelieved in, that he then believes in it or that he wishes to return and seeks from his Lord that he can return in order to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُوا يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if only you could see when they are held in the Fire and they will say, woe to us, would that we could be sent back into the world and then do not deny the signs of our Lord and so that we could be from the believers.  </strong></span>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is a distinction between Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) because the <em>deen</em> (religion) is of three levels:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Islaam</em></li>
<li><em>Al-eemaan</em> (true faith)</li>
<li><em>Al-i<u>h</u>saan</em> (perfection of worship). &#8211; highest level</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel and the broadest and widest of these three levels is the level of Islaam because Islaam is <em>al-Istislaam bid-dhaahir</em> (to surrender outwardly) and he may be a believer inwardly or he may be a hypocrite who is just submitting outwardly but  a disbeliever inwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>eemaan</em>, it is not applied to the hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>, for the believer who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it and the believer who is deficient in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when they Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are mentioned together then in that case Islaam means the outward rulings and what is meant by <em>eemaan</em> are the inner rulings.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the zakaah and that you fast ramadaan and that you perform Hajj to the house.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the outward actions; actions of the tongue and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Inform me about eemaan (true faith).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“It is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His books and in His Messengers, in the Last Day and that you truly believe in Al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the inward actions, in other words, the actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> must be combined so if only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it. So if <em>eemaan</em> alone is mentioned then Islaam enters within it and if Islaam is mentioned then <em>eemaan</em> enters within it. And therefore, the People of Knowledge say Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> if they come together then they separate in meaning, when they are found separate then they come together, each one of them will have the meaning of both, meaning, in meaning just like the case of <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) and <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person), if they are mentioned together meaning in a text then the <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) has a certain meaning and the word <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person) has a separate meaning. When only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance and with regard to the animals that they slaughter and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are Muslims and believers (<em>mu`minoon)</em> because whoever is a believer (a <em>mu`min)</em> then he will be a Muslim automatically. Whereas whoever is a Muslim then he may be a believer; a <em>mu`min</em> but he may be a hypocrite (<em>munaafiq)</em>. However, as for correct Islaam then it must have <em>eemaan</em> along with it even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَالَتِ الْأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا ۖ قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا وَلَٰكِن قُولُوا أَسْلَمْنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The desert Arabs, bedouins said, “we have believed.” Say, “you are not believers but rather you should say <em>aslamnaa</em> (we have submitted).”</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance”, </strong>the Muslim even if he is only such outwardly then he will have the ruling of the Muslims. They should ally themselves to him and if he dies, they should wash him and shroud him and pray the funeral prayer over him and bury him in the graveyard of the Muslims and whilst he is alive, they should love him and ally themselves with him and they have mercy amongst themselves and they behave as brothers between themselves. This is the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The likeness of the believers with regard to the mutual love and mutual mercy and mutual compassion is the likeness of a single body. If one part of it has a complaint then the rest of the body suffers sleeplessness and feverishness on account of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The believer to the believer is just like a solid structure each part of which supports the rest (and he interlaced his fingers).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the  believers are brothers; <em>ikhwaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The believers are but brothers.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49) <em>aayah</em> 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brothers with regard to <em>eemaan </em>not in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are believers and Muslims with regard to their slaughtered animals”, </strong>the meat sacrificed by a Muslim is <em>halaal</em> (lawful) even if he is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner) as long as he has not exited from Islaam then the meat that he has slaughtered is <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the hypocrite if he slaughters also, then we will eat it based upon his being judged to be a Muslim as long as it does not become clear that he is a hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for that which you (plural) slaughter. </strong>(</span>Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an address to the Muslims and He made permissible the sacrifices of <em>Ahl ul-Kitaab</em> (People of the Book).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the meat of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the sacrificed animals because they sacrifice upon the legislated manner in accordance with what they have from the scripture. As for the animals sacrificed by the idol worshippers and the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers) and the atheists and the apostates then we do not eat that because it is a sacrifice of a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and it is impure because the sacrifice of a disbeliever is dead meat. So it is impure on account of the disbelief since it is affected by the one who sacrifices it so it will be foul because the one who slaughters it is foul and it is affected by him and the fact that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has permitted for us the slaughtered meat of the People of the Book specifically. This is a proof that the slaughtered meat of other than them is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the prayer is performed over every Muslim even if he was a sinner and a disobedient one or a hypocrite who did not make his hypocrisy apparent as long as he did not exit from Islaam then the prayer is performed for him and supplication is made for him and forgiveness is sought for him and he inherits from his close Muslim relative and his close Muslim relative inherits from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam”,</strong> meaning we do not declare anyone pure such that we say so and so is a <em>mu`min</em> (believer) because bearing witness for him that he is a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> is a witness that he may not be deserving of and therefore when  a man said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give something to so and so because he is a believer.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the person said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give to so and so because he is a believer (from the booty).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended by this that the person should not declare someone to be pure and perfect by saying he’s a believer. Rather, he should apply the general term to him and say he is a Muslim and he may be a Muslim who is firm upon Islaam and he may be a Muslim who has sins and acts of disobedience and deficiencies and he may be a hypocrite so you should not bear witness for him with completeness.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So if he neglects anything from that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> unless and until he repents”, </strong>the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> is that sins even if they are major sins (<em>kabaa&#8217;ir</em>) as long as they are less than <em>shirk</em> then they do not cause the Muslim to exit from Islaam or they do not exit him from the domain of <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, he will be a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> in accordance with his <em>eemaan</em>, a sinner in accordance with the level of his major sin or you say &#8220;he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or deficient in <em>eemaan</em>”, </strong>meaning we accept from him what is apparent and we entrust his hidden state to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“unless he manifests to you neglect of the duties of Islaam”, </strong>meaning unless he commits something, which nullifies a person’s Islaam and from them is to neglect or abandon the religious duties of Islaam so then you will judge that he is guilty of apostasy just as if he abandoned the prayer deliberately or if he spoke with a word of disbelief such as abusing Allaah or abusing the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or abusing the religion of Islaam for then you would judge that he is guilty of <em>riddaa</em> (apostasy) in accordance with what has become apparent. So whoever manifests something, which nullifies Islaam along with removal of any valid excuse and removal of any preventing factors and is he misinterpreting something or is he just blindly following someone else or is he <em>jaahil</em> (one who is totally ignorant), was he angry. For in that case, he will not be judged to be an apostate along with these preventing factors.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Side point: As occurs here in the text, <strong>“this world is a place of eemaan and Islaam”, </strong>when the two are mentioned together they separate in meaning. Islaam means the outward duties of Islaam; the prayers, the <em>zakaat</em> and so on and so forth whereas <em>eemaan</em> in that case refers to the inner actions and beliefs of the heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 4: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“When was <em>Al-Hijrah</em> (Migration) legislated, and what were the types of hijrah in the era of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam)?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>hijrah</em> of the Muslims from Makkah to Al-Habasha (in Ethiopia), which is the first <em>hijrah</em>, took place in the month of Rajab five years after the <em>mab’ath</em> (the time when the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam</em>) was sent with Islaam) as the historians mention. As for the <em>hijrah</em> of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) from Makkah to Madeenah, it took place in the month of Rabee’ Al-Awwal thirteen years after being sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the types of <em>hijrah</em> which existed in the era of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), a group of Scholars have mentioned various types of hijrahs to the point that some of them mentioned eight types, however, some of these types are not accepted as being called <em>hijrah</em>, rather they are delegations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever the case may be, the hijrahs that occurred in Islaam and have the right to be called hijrah are of two forms:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Moving from the land of fear to the land of safety, as occurred in the two hijrahs to Al-Habasha, for verily Al-Habasha was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims in comparison to Makkah, and likewise in the beginning of the hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, for verily Madeenah at first was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The <em>hijrah</em> from the land of disbelief to the land of belief. That occurred after the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) took residence in Madeenah, and those Muslims who were able to, made <em>hijrah</em> to it. <em>Al-Hijrah</em> at that time was only relevant to moving to Madeenah, until Makkah was conquered. The specific ruling then ceased, while the general ruling of leaving the land of disbelief for whoever was able to do so remained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 30 : Point 38</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And hypocrisy (an-nifaaq) is to display Islaam upon the tongue whilst hiding disbelief (al-kufr) in the heart.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F371203025&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/hypocrisy-in-belief-nifaaq-itiqaadee-and-hypocrisy-in-action-nifaaq-amaliy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy) is to show outwardly that which is good and to conceal inwardly that which is evil. And it (<em>nifaaq</em>; hypocrisy) is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first of them being:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Nifaaqun I`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy of belief)</span> and this is <em>kufrun akbar</em> (major disbelief). And the hypocrite; munaafiq is worse than the <em>kaafirun asliyy</em> (original disbeliever) because the original disbeliever, it is well known about him that he is a disbeliever; kaafir and that he is an enemy. However, the munaafiq (the hypocrite), he deceives the Muslims and he manifests that he is from them when he is actually an enemy to them. He manifests openly that he is a Muslim whilst when he is actually a kaafir (a disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They try to deceive Allaah and those who believe but they do not actually deceive except their ownselves whilst they do not perceive.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, Allaah will put them in the lowest depths of the Fire beneath the worshippers of the idols and the kuffaar (disbelievers) because they are worse than the disbelievers. And therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High said with regard to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They </strong>(the hypocrites)<strong>, they are the enemy so beware of them, may Allaah curse them, how do they deviate away from the truth?</strong></span> [01] (Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), aayah 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nifaaqun I`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy of belief) is that which <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) can never combine with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>An-Nifaaqun `Amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in actions)</span>; it is that a person is a believer; a mu`min outwardly and inwardly. However, some characteristics come from him from the characteristics of the hypocrites, which render his <em>eemaan</em> deficient and there is a severe threat for it. However, he does not exit from the religion. It is called <em>an-nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) and it is called an-<em>nifaaq ul-asghar</em> (the lesser hypocrisy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this is occurs in his saying <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“There are four things, whoever has them all in him then he will be a pure hypocrite and whoever has a single characteristic from them then he will have a characteristic of hypocrisy till he abandons it. When he talks, he lies and when he makes a promise, he breaks it and when he is trusted, he proves treacherous and when he argues, he speaks in a foul manner.”</span> </strong>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with regard to the believer, then hypocrisy in action may appear from him and it will be a deficiency in his eemaan and he will be deserving of the threat, however, he does not depart from the religion on account of that. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this hypocrisy in action is <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>ar-riya</em></strong></span> (performing deeds to show off), which Allaah’s <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> feared for his companions and he called it lesser shirk. So he said: </strong><strong>“That which I fear most for you is lesser shirk.” </strong><strong>So they said: </strong><strong>“And what is lesser shirk, Oh Messenger of Allaah?” </strong><strong>So he said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“It is ar-riya (acting to show off). Allaah will say on the Day of Resurrection when the people are recompensed for their deeds; go to those people whom you used to show off to in the world and look and see, do you find any recompense with them and any reward with them?” </strong></span>[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Shall I not inform you of that which is more fearful with me upon you than AlMaseehud-Dajjaal?” So they said: “Yes indeed.” So he said: “It is hidden shirk that a man stands up and prays and he beautifies his prayer because of the fact that he sees a man looking at him.”</strong> </span>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when this person prays in the presence of the people, he adorns his prayer and when he prays in his house or in a place when he is unseen, he prays very quickly. Then this is what the Companions used to fear for themselves severely. So, no-one can declare himself to be totally free and innocent of it. So a person should fear it and therefore they said with regard to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one fears it except for a true believer and no-one feels secure from it except for a hypocrite.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim fears for himself from this hypocrisy, which is lesser hypocrisy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And hypocrisy is that he manifests Islaam upon his tongue and he hides disbelief in the heart”</strong>, this is the definition of <em>an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy in belief) and it is <em>an-nifaaqun akbar</em> (major hypocrisy) and <em>eemaan</em> cannot combine with this. So it will never occur from a <em>mu`min</em> (a believer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High at the start of Sooratul-Baqarah divided mankind into three categories :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) believers; <em>mu’mineen</em> outwardly and inwardly ,<br />
(2) disbelievers; <em>kuffaar</em> outwardly and inwardly and<br />
(3) the hypocrites; <em>munaafiqeen</em>; those who manifest Islaam outwardly but hide disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He, the Perfect said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif-Laam-Meem. This is the Book about which there is no doubt, it is a guidance for the people of <em>Taqwaa</em> (dutiful to Allaah), those who truly believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) and who establish the prayer and who spend from that which we have given them and those who truly believe in that which was sent down to you (Muhammad) and who believe in that which came down before you and those who truly believe in the Hereafter. They are upon guidance from their Lord and they are the ones who will prosper.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aayahs are with regard to the believers; mu’mineen, those who are believers outwardly and inwardly. As for the disbelievers; outwardly and inwardly and Allaah said with regard to them in the following aayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who disbelieve, it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. Allaah has put a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and upon their sight there is a covering and there will be a tremendous punishment for them.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 6-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said with regard to the 3rd category; the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from the people, there are those who say we believe in Allaah and in the Last Day but they are not believers. They attempt to deceive Allaah and those who believe but they do not actually deceive except themselves whilst they do not perceive&#8230;.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Deaf , dumb and blind so they will not return to the truth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 8-18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these aayahs are with regard to the hypocrites; the munaafiqeen and they are ten and odd aayahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The hypocrite is the one who manifests Islaam upon his tongue and hides disbelief in the dameer; heart.”</strong> Ad-dameer means that which he conceals within the heart. [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01 <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em>hafizahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Indeed there has come down with regard to them (the hypocrites) a soorah which is specifically about them, which is called Sooratul-Munaafiqoon; 63rd soorah and it from its start to its end speaks about their shameful deeds just as Allaah, the Most High also exposed them in other soorahs as occurs in Sooratul-Noor, 24th soorah, and Sooratut-Towbah the 9th soorah to the extent that this soorah is called Al-Faadeehah (the exposing soorah) because it exposes the hypocrites and also Sooratul-Ahzaab; 33rd soorah and some parts of Sooratul-Baqarah and some parts of Soorah-Aali `Imraan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (34) and Muslim (58) from a hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Shaykh Saalih As Suhaymee</strong> hafizahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And this type of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy with regard to actions) does not take the person outside the fold of Islaam even though the seriousness of its sin is great because it may lead over time to falling into hypocrisy in belief and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>Aameen</em>. And all of it is evil and hypocrisy is blameworthy from every angle and therefore there has never been any movement against Islaam and against the Muslims except that the hypocrites were found within their ranks; either aiding them with material or by laying down plans for them, plotting for them or by preparing the way for them or by making false promises until Allaah, the Exalted and Most High exposed them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, al-Bayhaqiyy in Shu`b al-Eemaan, al-Bagawiyy in SharhusSunnah from a hadeeth of Mahmood ibn Labeeb radiyAllaahu `anh and al-Mundhiriyy said in his book AtTargeeb Wa At-Tarheeb, “its chain of narration is good.” Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said in his checking of AtTargeeb Wa At-Tarheeb, “saheeh (authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, ibn Maajah in his Sunan, at-Tahaawiyy in Sharh Mushkili alAathaar, ibn Adiyy and a number of others, at-Tabariyy in Tahdheebu al-Aathaar, al-Haakim and others from a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy radiyAllaahu `anh. This hadeeth was declared saheeh by atTahaawiyy and al-Haakim and ad-Dhaahabi agreed and al-Boosayriyy declared it hasan in his Misbaah AzZujaajah; al-Boosayriyy`s notes on his checking of ibn Maajah. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said in his checking of ibn Maajah, “this hadeeth is hasan (good).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“<em>An-nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy) is derived from <em>an-nafq</em>, which means <em>al-juhr</em>; literally animal burrow or a tunnel, which is found in the earth and it is called that because the person who has it has hypocrisy. He makes apparent something contrary to that which he hides. And this is what is called <em>an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em>; (hypocrisy in belief) and as for <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) then that does not take a person outside Islaam, rather this person remains as a Muslim and this is called <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) because the person with it, he manifests something contrary to what he hides does something. </span><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">As for </span><em style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;"> (hypocrisy in belief) then that is the hypocrisy of the hypocrites, those who were in the time of the Prophet </span><em style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;"> and it is to manifest Islaam whilst hiding disbelief and the person tries to guard against revealing what he actually believes and therefore Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic has informed about them that the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth of the Fire and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 29 : Point 37</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And there is no harm in praying whilst wearing <em>saraaweel</em> (broad and loose trousers).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370749995&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/praying-in-trousers-or-pants" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>as-saraweel</em> is in the singular.[04] So <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), this word <em>assaraaweel</em> is the singular and it is something well known; it is what is worn upon the `<em>awrah</em>, over the private parts, that which needs to be covered from navel to knee so it is sewn to fit the lower half of the body and it has legs. The prayer is correct in <em>saraweel</em> (loose trousers), this is with regard to the man because the `<em>awrah</em> of the man is between the navel to the knee, and trousers (<em>saraaweel</em>), they cover that. So if a person prays in <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), which properly cover what’s between his navel and his knee, then his prayer will be correct. As for the woman then all of her is `<em>awrah</em> in the prayer except for her face if she has no men who are non mahram. So if he prays in an <em>izaar</em> (waist wrapper) then that would be better than trousers (<em>saraweel</em>) or if he prays in a <em>qamees</em> (a shirt) reaching down to the shins then that would be even better because it will be more beautiful for the appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Aadam, take your adornment at every Prayer.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masjid, meaning at every Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Az-zeenah</em>, adornment, is as Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Adornment is more general just being a cover for the private parts.”</strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> They mentioned as occurs in Lisaanul-`Arab, this word is a word originally from Persian introduced into Arabic. And the singular term is <em>saraaweel</em> and the plural is <em>saraaweelaat</em>, meaning trousers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In this speech from Imaam al-Barbahaariyy <em>rahimahullaah</em>, there is some refutation of some of the categories of the Shee`ah, those who hold it is forbidden to pray in <em>saraaweel</em> (trousers) because they are affected from wind that comes out of the trousers. So they make it obligatory to remove the trousers when performing the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> <strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“I say, as for <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), which it is permissible to pray in then they are the <em>saraaweel</em> (looser trousers) which cover the `<em>awrah</em>, those which are broad and loose upon the body such that the person is able to carry out the prayer in the most complete manner. As for if they are tight and they show off the shape of the buttocks then prayer in them would be makroo`ah (disliked) and the prayer may even be null and void if the one wearing them is not able to carry out the pillars, if he is not able to sit properly for the tashahhud and between the sajdahs. And Allaah is the one who grants success.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymiyy</strong> hafizahullaah said in his explanation of this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Likewise, prayer in saraaweel (loose trousers) covers two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, it covers the permissibility of sufficing of wearing loose trousers if they cover and they are loose and wide. And it also contains a refutation of some of the sects of the Ismaa`eeliyys and those who follow their way because when they want to pray, it is essential upon them, they hold, to take off their trousers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh `Abdul `Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about <em>al-bantaloon</em> (tighter trousers);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Is it permissible to pray in these trousers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul `Azeez Bin Baaz <em>rahimahullaah</em> responded,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“If the trousers <em>saraaweel</em> cover what’s between the navel and the knee of the man and they are <em>waasi</em>` (broad), they are not <em>dayyiq</em> (tight) then in that case the Prayer will be correct in them and what is better is that there should be a long shirt over them which covers between the navel and knee. And if it goes down to halfway down the shins or down to the ankles, that is better because that will cover better. And Prayer in an <em>izaar</em> (a waist wrapper) is even better than prayer in loose trousers which do not have a long shirt over them because the <em>izaar</em> is more complete in covering than just loose trousers.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">An answer from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Naasiruddin al-Albaaniyy</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> that you find on some of his taped answers to the questions, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">“Wearing these tight trousers, <em>bantaloon</em> it has two problems (<em>museebataan</em>):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The 1st problem is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The person wearing them will be resembling the disbelievers whereas the Muslims used to wear <em>saraaweel</em> (looser trousers) that were very broad and loose, which some people still wear in Syria and Lebanon. And the Muslims had not used to know about these <em>bantaloon</em>, these tight trousers, except when they were colonised; and then when the colonialists departed they left their evil affects behind and the Muslims took them up based upon their stupidity and their ignorance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">And, </span><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The 2nd problem is:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> These tight trousers describe the shape of the `<em>awrah</em>.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 29 : Point 36</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;And as for Fasting whilst upon a journey, then whoever wishes may Fast and whoever wishes may withhold from Fasting.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370743200&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/breaking-the-fast-during-the-journey-is-from-the-concessions-of-the-shariah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>rukhas</em> (concessions/allowances) that Allaah has made for his servants is to withhold from Fasting in Ramadaan when upon a journey. So it is a <em>rukhsah</em> (concession). So whoever wishes, he can <em>aftara</em> (withhold) from Fasting and whoever wishes he can Fast. And if he Fasts whilst upon a journey then his Fasting will be correct because a Companion asked the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saying that he had strength and he was able to Fast upon a journey so he asked the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave him permission to Fast upon the journey. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a concession, so an allowance has been made, it is not obligatory to do it, rather it is better to do it just like the rest of the concessions. And if the person returns to the original situation (the <em>asl </em>) and Fasts then there is no harm upon that. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever amongst you witnesses the beginning of the month (month of Ramadaan), whilst he is resident then let him Fast it and whomever is sick or upon a journey, let him Fast other days</strong></span>. (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to break his Fast upon his journeys. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim (no. 1121) from Hamzah ibn `Amr al-Aslamiyy radiyAllaahu `anh that he said, <strong>“Oh Messenger of Allah, I find that I have strength to Fast upon the journey so would there be any sin upon me?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“It is a concession from Allaah so whoever takes it up then this is fine and whoever wishes to Fast then there is no sin upon him.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy, correct reference is (no. 1944) and Muslim (no. 1113) from Ibn `Abbaas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> went out to go to Makkah in Ramadaan. So he Fasted until he reached Al-Kadeed then he broke his Fast; and the people stopped Fasting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This was in the eighth year; it was the journey for the Conquest of Makkah. AlKadeed is a place around two riding stages from Makkah, a place around fifty-five miles from Makkah.</p>

<p>Imaam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;And shortening the prayer whilst upon a journey is Sunnah.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>rukhas</em> (concessions/allowances), which the legislation came with to make things easier for the servants and to remove difficulty, is shortening the prayer whilst upon a journey and it is shortening the four <em>rak`ah</em> prayer and this is by the text of the Qur&#8217;aan, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you travel upon the earth …</strong></span><br />
(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning <em>saafartum</em>; when you go on a journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… then there is no sin upon you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve may put you to trial.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa (4), aayah 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent from the aayah is then it is not permissible to shorten the prayer except in a state of fear. However, this problem has been removed because Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Why is it that we still shorten, now that we have become secure?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“That is a charity which Allaah has given to you so accept from Allaah His charity.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to shorten the prayer <strong>on all of his journeys;</strong> he would shorten the four <em>rak`ahs</em> prayer to two <em>rak`ahs</em>. This is the Sunnah, and whoever completes it then that is permissible, however it is in opposition to that which is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So shortening (<em>al-qasr</em>) is a concession, whoever wishes he can do it and that is better, whoever wishes, he can leave it and complete it, then there is no harm in that because completing (four rak&#8217;ahs) is the <em>asl</em>. And the author mentioned that because <span style="color:#ff0000;">accepting the concessions of the legislation is from matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> and that contains a refutation of those who are <em><strong>mutashaddideen</strong> </em>(over harsh); those who do not accept the legislated concessions</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 28 : Point 34</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">And wiping over the leather socks is Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370399778&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/wiping-over-the-leather-socks-is-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And wiping over the leather socks is Sunnah.”</strong> He stated this matter, even though it is from the matters of fiqh then it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em>. For whoever denies wiping upon the leather socks, then he will be outside the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>, contradicting the correct creed and belief; because wiping over the leather socks is established from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in many ahaadeeth which reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge numbers of people at every single level of transmission, so many that it would be impossible to gather together upon a lie). [05] Wiping over the leather socks is a concession and acting upon a concession is a Sunnah, because of his saying <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah loves that His concessions should be taken up, just as He hates that acts of disobedience to Him are committed.&#8221;</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So wiping over the leather socks, and wiping over whatever takes the places of the leather socks with regard to normal socks, is established in the Prophetic Sunnah. And no one disagrees about it except for the <strong>Raafidah (Shee`ah)</strong>, whilst they affirm wiping upon the feet. So in the view of the Raafidah the feet are not to be washed, rather they are to be wiped over using as evidence the aayah (of wudoo):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And wipe your heads and wipe your feet up to the ankles</strong></span> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in their view the <strong>ka`baan</strong> (two ankle bones) it doesn&#8217;t mean the two well known ankle bones at the bottom of the shins, rather in their view it refers to what comes under the strap of the shoe or sandal, and it is where the foot joins the heel – that which is called the throne of the foot (i.e. the arch or ridge on top of the foot). This is the <strong>ka`b</strong> (ankle bone) in the view of the Raafidah. It is other than ka`b which is with the people of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no proof for them even with the recitation with kasrah in the aayah (wa arjul<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">i</span></strong>kum), because the well-known recitation is with it being mansoob:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Wa arjul<span style="color:#ff0000;">a</span>kum</strong>’ joining it to those things (which are to be washed), ‘<strong>faghsiloo wujooh<span style="color:#ff0000;">a</span>kum…</strong>’ (i.e. wash your faces and your feet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regards to the recitation where there is a kasrah, then it is on account of the word being next to His saying ‘wamsahoo bi ru·oosikum’ (i.e. wipe your heads and also your feet). And the proof is that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam used to wash his feet, and he had not used to wipe except upon the leather socks. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam an-Nawawiyy stated that some of the reports contain from eighty Companions including the ten promised Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, by at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamus-Sagheer, Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah Ibn `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. And it is declared saheeh by al-Munthiriyy in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb, and he declared the chain of narration of Ahmad to be authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> And Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb declared this hadeeth to be hasan saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Wiping over the leather socks is from the Sunnahs. And wiping upon the leather socks has entered upon the matters of creed and belief, because some of the innovators deny it; and they are the Khawaarij and the Shee`ah, using as proof that it does not occur in the Qur&#8217;aan. But it is established from the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> through the narration of a group of the Companions. And denying it has become a distinguishing sign of the people of innovations. And the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah affirm it, because of the proofs for it.”</span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And stoning is true.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370008986&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/stoning-the-adulterer-or-adulteress-is-true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has forbidden some things relating to matters affecting peoples&#8217; honour or relating to dealings and other than that.; and these forbidden matters are divided into categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Forbidden things which are major sins<br />
&#8211; Forbidden matters which are lesser sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then with regard to the punishment upon the one who commits them, they are divided into three categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first category:</strong></span> forbidden things for which Allaah has laid down prescribed punishments. They are called <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>al-hudood</em> prescribed punishments</strong></span> from the word <em>al-hadd</em> (limit); it means <strong>prevention</strong>. They are called that because they prevent from falling into these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second category:</strong></span> forbidden things which Allaah has not laid down prescribed punishments for, however there is <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>ta`zeer</em> (discretionary) punishments</strong></span> for them; and it is left to the discretion of the ruler in accordance with whatever he sees will be a deterrent from them. And this is called <em>ta`zeer</em> and it is a <span style="color:#003300;"><strong>correctional</strong> </span>punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third category:</strong></span> that which does not have a laid down prescribed punishment nor does it have a discretionary punishment from those forbidden things. However, there does occur with regard to it <strong>a threat and a mention of anger and curse and Fire</strong> and other than that from the types of threat; such as consuming usury and gambling and other than that. With regard to this there is a severe threat which will deter whoever has eemaan (true faith) in his heart. And whoever does not have eemaan in his heart or he is weak in faith, then in front of him there will be a <strong>reckoning and a punishment in the Hereafter</strong>. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has made forbidden these forbidden matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah made obligatory duties obligatory, so do not neglect them. And He made some things forbidden, so do not commit them. And He remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not out of forgetfulness, so do not ask about them.</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from these prescribed punishments is the prescribed punishment for fornication. And fornication is to commit illicit sexual intercourse in the private part of one not lawful for him, except through correct legislated marriage contract.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who guard their private parts, except upon their wives or the slaves whom their right hands possess. For they are not blameworthy. And whoever seeks something beyond that, then they are the transgressors.</span></strong> (Sooratul- Ma`aarij (70), aayah 29 &#8211; 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning those who go beyond what is lawful and enter into that which is forbidden. So whoever enters into fornication, then he will be one of two categories. Either if he is a virgin, meaning he has not had relations with a woman in a lawful marriage which kept him chaste, he is a virgin, then his punishment will be that he will be lashed one hundred times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the female fornicator and the male fornicator, lash each one of them with a hundred lashes. And let not pity deter you from obedience to Allaah, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic Sunnah that he should be exiled, meaning banished from his land where he committed the illicit sexual relations and sent to another land for a the period of one year. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>For a virgin committing it with a virgin, then the punishment is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So exile is confirmed in the Sunnah. As for lashing then it is established in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the scholars are agreed in consensus upon lashing, and the majority of them also agree upon exile. This is with regard to the punishment for the virgin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong>previously married person</strong>, and he is the one who has had relations already with the wife in a correct marriage, and he recognizes the value of peoples honour and the sanctity of peoples honour. And this person, he is stoned with stones until he dies. And this is established in the Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> said upon the mimbar of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The aayah of stoning came down and we comprehended it and we preserved it. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned. And I fear that if a time becomes prolonged for the people, that they will start to say, ‘We do not find stoning in the Book of Allaah’. Indeed it is in the Book of Allaah.</strong> </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned and he commanded stoning. And the Muslims are agreed in consensus upon that. And no one disagreed about it, except for the people of innovations, those whose disagreement is not taken account of such as the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So stoning is established in the Book and in the Sunnah of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sayings (Sunnah qawliyyah) and his actions (Sunnah `amaliyyah) and by consensus. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So whoever denies it is a disbeliever, because he is denying that which Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims</span>. So stoning is established. There is no scope for speech about it. And therefore he stated it here and said “Stoning is true”. This is the creed and belief of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah in refutation of the innovators, those who deny stoning without knowledge and without clear insight, because of their ignorance and because of their childishness in regards to knowledge; and they are relying upon their intellects and their own thinking. And those people are not counted. No notice is taken of them and their sayings are not looked at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sometimes an ignorant person can come claiming awareness and to have researched and say, “There is disagreement about this.” So it is said to him, “Is it the case that every disagreement is taken account of?! There are matters of disagreement which are totally discarded and not counted. And from them is this disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the writer of the lines of poetry said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Not every disagreement that comes about is taken account of, except that which has of correct examination.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is not just claims of disagreement. The matter is one of verification of what is correct and tying it to the proof. So whoever goes against the proof, then he is defeated in the argument and there is no weight given to his disagreeing, and he is not counted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you disagree about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the last day, that is the better and finer in its outcome.</span></strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we do not just remain upon there being disagreement, rather we refer back to the proof, because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the last day, that is the better and finer regarding its outcome.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the author rahimahullaah he stated the issue of stoning even though this book is a book of creeds and beliefs, because <span style="color:#ff0000;">it is obligatory to believe in the obligation of stoning; and whoever denies it has become a disbeliever.</span> So therefore he stated it as a refutation of the innovators who deny stoning. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This hadeeth occurs as no. 30 in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth. It is reported by at-Tabaraaniyy in alMu`jamul-Kabeer, Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, ad-Daaraqutniyy in his Sunan, al-Haakim in his Mustadrak, al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa and others. It was declared hasan good by an-Nawawiyy in RiyaadusSaaliheen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translators side point:</strong> It occurs as a hadeeth of Aboo Tha`labah al-Khushaniyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said with regard to this narration in Ghaayatul-Maraam (no. 4), “This narration is actually da`eef (weak). Makhool did not meet Aboo Tha`labah.” However in the same book Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declares hasan (good) the narration which bears some resemblance with this one, which is the hadeeth of Abud-Dardaa· <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whatever Allaah made lawful in His book, then it is lawful. And whatever He made forbidden, then it is forbidden. And whatever He remained silent about, then it is pardoned. So accept from Allaah that which He has pardoned for Allaah would not forget anything.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord never forgets.</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth reported by al-Haakim and declared hasan by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1690) as a hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibnus-Saamit <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You also find that same narration from a different Companion reported by alBukhaariyy, also by Aboo Daawood, at-Timithiyy and Ibn Maajah. This wording actually occurring in the text is the wording of Ibn Maajah. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared it likewise saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6829). Also reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1691) from a narration of `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation that from the established Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed he stoned Maa`iz [reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6824)] and the woman connected with the employee [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6828)] and the woman of the Juhaniyy tribe, al-Juhaniyyah [Muslim (no. 1696)]. And he stoned two Jews who had committed fornication [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6841)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> passed away and this ruling remained being acted upon. And the khulafaa· stoned after him.”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[Listen to 32 (Part A) </strong></span><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/15/there-is-to-be-no-obedience-to-any-human-in-disobedience-to-allaah/">Here</a></strong><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369868715&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/bearing-witness-of-paradise-or-of-the-fire-for-a-specific-individual-without-a-proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And witness (meaning regarding Paradise or the Fire) may not be given against anyone nor for him based upon his having done a good or bad deed.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter of bearing witness of Paradise or of the Fire for a specific individual, this is that matter. So witness is not given for a specific individual that he will be in Paradise nor is witness given that he will be in the Fire, except with a proof from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who there is no proof to state that he is from the people of Paradise, even if he is a righteous person, a believer, we do not do so because we do not know what his concluding action will be. And likewise, a sinful person or a disbeliever, we do not state for certain that the individual that he is from the people of the Fire because he might repent and we do not know. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“One of you may perform the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit (forearm); but then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it. And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a forearm (a cubit) and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span> </strong>[06 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the concluding actions are not known except to Allaah, the Knower of all hidden things, He, the Perfect and Most High. But as for us, then we have fear for the people of sins and we have hope for the people of acts of obedience but we do not state with certainty. Rather, we have hope for those who are obedient but we do not state with certainty, and we have fear for the sinful ones but we do not state with certainty. This is with regard to specific individuals. As for in general, then we state with certainty that the people of eemaan (true belief) are the people of Paradise and we state with certainty that the disbelievers are the people of the Fire. Allaah, the Most High, said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for the disbelievers.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for those who have taqwaa (those who are fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him).</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to in general. As for specific individuals and specific people, then this is entrusted to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, we behave and deal with them on the basis of what is apparent. We deal with the people of obedience in accordance with what appears from them and we deal with the people of sins in accordance to what is apparent from them. We pass judgement in accordance with what is apparent only, not stating the final destination and the final outcome, for that lies in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6594) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 2643) from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the famous hadeeth of as-Saadiq al-Masdooq, the fourth hadeeth in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the wording of a hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> dealt with a point, which wasn’t dealt with here directly: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And there is no sin except that the servant can repent from it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “At-Towbah (repentance) is acceptable from every sin with regard to the rulings relating to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> meaning, in the Hereafter that would be wiped away from him. When `Amr ibn al-`Aas came to accept Islaam and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> told him to put out his hand to give his pledge &#8211; that’s when he withheld it for a moment. He said, “Because I want to make a condition.” So the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> asked him what condition he wanted to make. He said, “What I did before should be forgiven.” So therefore the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said the hadeeth the shaykh quotes here.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet s<em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu `anhu,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Do you not know that Islaam demolishes what came before it and that performing Hijrah demolishes what came before it and that the Hajj demolishes what came before it.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (121) in the Book of Eemaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And his saying with regard to the man who killed ninety-nine men, ‘And who can come between him and between repentance?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The hadeeth reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the ahaadeeth in this regard are very clear. And the disagreement is with regard to a person who spoke with words of abuse against the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or against the Qur·aan &#8211; is his repentance accepted with regard to this world or is judgement passed that he is to be executed, even if he makes clear his repentance? Then this has been clarified by Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah in his book As-Saarimul-Maslool `alaa Shaatimir-Rasool <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 32 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </strong>And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369857102&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-obedience-to-a-created-being-in-disobedience-to-the-creator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And know that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong> This is an exception to what has preceded, referring to what he mentioned with regard to it being obligatory to obey the ruler, that it is not obligatory in everything. Rather, they are only to be obeyed in that which is not <em>ma`siyah</em> (a sin). As for if they command a sin, then they are not obeyed upon sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">And there occurs in the hadeeth: that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> appointed a leader over an army detachment of the Companions. So when they proceeded upon the way, he (this leader) said to them, “Gather some firewood.” So, when they had gathered it, he said, “Set it on fire.” So, when they had set is blazing, he said, “Enter into the fire. Did not the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> say, ‘Hear and obey’?” So some of them said, “We did not obey the Messenger except in order to flee away from the Fire so how can we then enter into it?!” So therefore they refused to enter into it. So when that (news) reached Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> he said, “If they had entered it then they would not have come out from it. Obedience is only in that which is good.” </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said with regard to the parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And be thankful to Me and to your parents; the return will be to Me. And if those two strive&#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the parents,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230; to make you associate along with Me that which you have no knowledge of then do not obey them; but live with them in this world in a good manner; and follow the way of those who turn to Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), aayahs 14 and 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">However that does not mean that obedience to the ruler ceases if he commands something sinful, but rather it means that he is not obeyed in that sin, whereas obedience to him remains in that which is not a sin.</span> This is the meaning of “There is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not to be said that Allaah has commanded obedience to the ruler and He has commanded fine treatment and obedience to the parents in everything. We say, yes Allaah commanded obedience to those in authority (but), upon what is good; and He commanded obedience to the parents, however in what is good, not in disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[03](The hadeeth) has preceded. (Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (7145) and Muslim (1840) from a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] It’s checking has preceded. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and at-Tabaraaniyy and others from a hadeeth of `Imraan ibn Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 31</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is permissible to fight the Khawaarij if they attack the property, persons or families of the Muslims; but if they desist and depart then it is not his right to chase them nor are their wounded to be killed nor may he seize their property as booty nor may he kill those of them taken captive nor may he chase those of them who flee.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369450953&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-permissible-to-fight-thekhawaarij-ifthey-attack-the-propertypersons-or-families-of-themuslims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have come to know that the Khawaarij are those who hold breaking away from obedience and they hold that there is no pledge of allegiance to the person in authority (the ruler) or that no bay`ah (pledge) remains if he commits sin; and they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins. So those people who accept this position but they do not have strength and they do not fight then they are left, along with their being advised and having the affair made clear to them so that perhaps they may return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for if they come to have strength and they manifest their force, then it becomes obligatory upon the Muslims to fight against them to repel their evil. And they are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers; rather they are fought against upon the basis that they are Muslims who have transgressed against the Muslims and attacked them. And for this reason when the Chief of the Believers (ameerulmu·mineen), `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> was questioned about the Khawaarij, “Are they disbelievers?” So he said, “No, they fled away from disbelief; but rather they are a people who transgressed against us.” [01],[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they (the Khawaarij) are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers, and therefore their women and their children are not taken as slaves and their property is not seized and those of them who are injured are not killed because the fighting against them is just to repel their evil, not because of their being disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is permissible to fight against the Khawaarij if they attack the Muslims with regard to their property, their persons and their families,”</strong> because the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded that they be fought against and because `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> fought against them when they attacked `Abdullaah ibn Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And they killed him and they split open the abdomen of his slave girl who was pregnant. So then when they did that the Chief of the Believers (meaning `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>) resolved to fight them because the first signs of their evil had now appeared from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“But it is not for him (the Muslim ruler), if they desist and leave them alone, to chase them.”</strong> If they desist from fighting then it is not for the ruler to chase them and to wage war against them as long as they do not commit transgression. So they are astray without any doubt and it is obligatory to give them advice so that perhaps they will return; however they are not to be fought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he may not kill their injured,”</strong> because the wounded person, his evil has been curbed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not take their property as booty,”</strong> meaning their property is not taken as ghaneemah (booty/spoils of war) because it is the property of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not kill those of them taken prisoner,”</strong> because they are Muslims and their evil has been prevented by their having been taken captive and by their being wounded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and those of them who flee away are not to be chased.”</strong> If they are defeated, then the ruler leaves them alone and he does not chase after them because their evil has been repelled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by `Abdur-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You’ll find some narrations reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah also in his Musannaf, as indicated here also by al-Bayhaqiyy. And some of the reports contain the wording that `Aliyy radiyAllaahu `anh said something similar to this with regard to the People of the Camel, meaning the Companions who fought against him in the Battle of the Camel, and in some of the reports it mentions that he said something like this with regard to the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And as for this wording that Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned here, then it is indeed as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned it, he said it was with regard to the Khawaarij and it is an important difference with regard to the wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyya</strong>h <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in Risaalatu Fadli Ahlil-Bayt wa Huqooqihim (a treatise with regard to the virtue of the Ahlul-Bayt, the family of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and their rights) “It is established from ameerul-mu·mineen `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> through different chains that when he fought against the People of the Camel, he did not take their children as slaves and he did not take their wealth as booty and he did not kill their wounded ones and he did not chase after those who fled and he did not kill any captive and he prayed (the funeral prayer) over those who had been killed from both sides, at both the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffeen. And he said “Ikhwaanunaa baghow `alaynaa.”, “They are our brothers; they transgressed against us.” And he informed that they are not disbelievers nor are they hypocrites. And in what he said he was following the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, since he called them brothers and he declared them to be believers in the fighting and in the transgression just as is mentioned in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن فَاءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said (two pages later),<span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"> “They are not equal those who were killed, who he prayed over and he called them ikhwaanunaa (our brothers), they are not equal along with those whom he did not pray over (the Khawaarij at the Battle of Nahrawaan).</span> </span>Rather, when it was said to him (quoting the aayah from Sooratul-Kahf (18), towards the end of the soorah), “Who are,</p>
<p>الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds! </span></strong>(18:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he replied, “They are the people of Harooraa· (meaning the Khawaarij).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned, “And likewise, the people of Siffeen, he prayed the funeral prayer over those who were killed from them and he said, ‘They are our brothers, they transgressed against us but the sword purified them.’ And if in his view they had been disbelievers, he would not have prayed funeral prayer over them and he would not have declared them to be brothers and he would not have stated that the sword purified anything from them.” (Minhaajus-Sunnah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the Khawaarij the wording is as Shaykh al-Fowzaan put it here. What is authentic with regard to the Khawaarij that he said when they asked, “Are they disbelievers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “No they fled from disbelief; they are a people who transgressed against us.” He didn’t call them his brothers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 26 : Point 30</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is not permissible to fight the ruler, nor to rebel against him even if he oppresses. And that is because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to Aboo Tharr al-Ghifaariyy, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em><strong>“Have patience, even if he is an Abyssinian slave.”</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And his saying to the Ansaar,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em><strong>“Have patience until you meet me at the Reservoir (the Howd).”</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It is not from the Sunnah to fight against the ruler for it brings about corruption of the worldly life and of the Religion.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F368954357&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-not-permissible-to-fight-the-rulernor-to-rebel-against-him-even-if-he-oppresses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to fight against the sultaan (ruler) by rebelling against him by using weaponry because this results in major evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is not permissible to fight against the ruler, nor to rebel against him even if he is oppressive.”</strong> Meaning it is forbidden – haraam &#8211; to fight against the ruler, meaning to fight against the ruler as is done by the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Even if he commits oppression.”</strong> Meaning (even if) some tyranny or oppression occurs from him then the person should have sabr, patience, upon that. Because having patience upon that, even though it has harm within it, then this is lighter (less serious) than the harm which results from rebelling against him. So the harm which comes about along with having patience upon obedience to the oppressive ruler, this is less serious than the harm which comes about through rebelling against him. And there is no doubt that from the principles that are confirmed in Islaam is: ‘taking on board the lesser of two harms to repel the greater one’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to the Ansaar,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“You will indeed see after me atharah (undue preference), so have patience until you meet me at the Howd (Great Reservoir).”</span></strong> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enjoined them with sabr (having patience) even though they were going to experience atharah (undue preference) against them &#8211; and it is preferring other people with wealth and excluding them. So he enjoined them with having patience because of what lies in this from repelling the greater of two evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And that is because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to Aboo Tharr al-Ghifaariyy, </strong><strong>“Have patience even if he be an Abyssinian slave.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning do not hold the ruler in contempt even if his appearance is not beautiful, even if he is black in colour, even if he does not have Arabian lineage, because what is counted is his position, which is the khilaafah (Caliphate) or al-imaarah (the major leadership) and what is counted is not his own person. So he is to be obeyed as long as he is a Muslim; and his bodily appearance is not to be looked to, which perhaps does not please the one who looks because of his deformity or ugliness or because of his shabby appearance or because of a defect in his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Even if he is a slave with severed limbs.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this does not justify rebelling against him even if he is a sick person or he has weak health. As long as the pledge of obedience was established for him then he should have patience with him and he is to be heard and obeyed, even if he has these characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Fighting against the sultaan (ruler) is not from the Sunnah.”</strong> It is not from the Sunnah established from the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to fight against the ruler &#8211; not in a single hadeeth, neither a weak one, nor a hasan one, nor an authentic one. There is not in the Sunnah any hadeeth which proves fighting against the Muslim ruler, even if he is sinful, even if he is an oppressor, even if he is a tyrant, even if he shows undue preference with wealth, then it is still not permissible to rebel against him. Rather the ahaadeeth, all of them, prove having patience with that and the forbiddance of rebelling against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not mean that the ruler shouldn’t receive naseehah, sincere advice. Rather he should be advised, in secret, privately between him and the one who is advising. So it is obligatory upon the person who has some sincere advice to take it to the ruler, just as he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;">“The religion is sincerity.”</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> So we said, “To whom?”</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> So he said,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> “To Allaah and to His Book and to His Messenger and to the rulers of the Muslims and to their common folk.”</span></strong> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that does not mean that he is not to be advised and that he is to be left alone; rather things must be made clear to him and he should be advised. And this is his right upon the scholars and upon his subjects and upon those whom he consults and upon people of sound opinion &#8211; that they give him sincere advice. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it is not from the Sunnah to fight against the sultaan (the ruler),”</strong> meaning, there is no proof for it; nothing saheeh (authentic) and nothing da`eef (weak) to show that it is legislated to fight against the Muslim ruler. Rather there is in it (the Sunnah) and in the Qur·aan also, the command to obey him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at his saying lÐm ‘minkum’ with the meaning, ‘from amongst you’, meaning as long as he is a Muslim, then it is obligatory to obey him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed (in rebelling against the ruler) in it lies corruption of the worldly life and of the Religion.”</strong> Fighting against the ruler brings about corruption of the worldly life such that authority is lost, fowdaa (anarchy/chaos) becomes widespread and the enemies overcome and the Religion becomes lost; since there is noone to establish the prescribed punishments and no-one who can carry out the qisaas, (retaliatory punishments) and there is no-one who can enforce the legislated rulings and give back the rights to those who deserve them and who can enforce the judicial rulings; and thus the Religion is corrupted and there is chaos and corruption. And the hand of the thief cannot be chopped, so therefore people’s wealth is lost. And the highway robbers do not have their limbs amputated and therefore the roads become disused &#8211; because who can establish all of this? He is the person in authority. This is from the function of the one in authority and no-one will be able, even if all the people gather, no one will be able to establish these affairs. Rather, chaos and anarchy will result. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 3792) and reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1845), hadeeth of Usayd Ibnul-Hudayr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Part of the same hadeeth brought by the author in the main text, hadeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 3792) and Muslim (no. 1845) and this being one particular wording of that, the wording reported by Muslim (no. 648)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by Muslim (no. 55) from hadeeth of Tameem ad-Daariyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymiyy <em>hafizahullaah</em> in his explanation said with regard to the word sultaan (the sultan, the one in authority), “His saying, ‘sultaan’. He used this word here to make it general, whether the person is a khaleefah (Caliph) or a malik (king), or a sultaan or a ra·ees (head or president), whatever he is, as long as he establishes the legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Whatever his title is, whether he is called a king or a sultaan (sultan) or an ameer (chief/head) or an imaam, whatever, then the witness here is that it is forbidden to rebel against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08]<strong> Translators side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said, “I say the `aqeedah (creed and belief) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is that fighting against the ruler is not permissible, and likewise rebelling against him. It is not permissible because of the prohibition of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his warning against rebelling against him and the prohibition of challenging him (the ruler) which occurs in the hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibnus-Saamit (with the wording):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘And that we will not challenge those in authority with regard to the affair.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Footnote: Hadeeth already preceded. Translator’s note: Meaning it was part of the pledge which the Companions gave to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that they would not challenge those in authority of the affair.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So challenging those in authority of the affair is not permissible, and that comes about by provoking and rabble rousing the common masses to rebel against them, all of this is not permissible. And from that is criticising the rulers from the minbars, for this will only enrage the hearts of those in authority and cause estrangement between those in authority and the common masses and cause them to have no trust in each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you and who you supplicate for them and they supplicate for you. And the worst of your rulers are those who you hate and who hate you and you abuse them and they abuse you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said, “We said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not challenge/go against them with regard to that?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, not as long as they establish the Prayer amongst you. No not as long as they establish the Prayer. Indeed, whoever has someone in authority over him and he sees him committing something from disobedience to Allaah then let him hate that which he commits from disobedience to Allaah, but let him not remove his hand from obedience.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Translator’s side point: Reported by Muslim as a hadeeth of `Owf ibn Maalik <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs concerning this topic and the writings, and the statements of the Salaf which cover this are plentiful. And Allaah is the One Who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever rebels against one of the Muslim rulers, then he is one of the Khawaarij. He has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and he dies a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F368949977&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-rebels-against-one-of-the-muslim-rulers-then-he-is-one-of-the-khawaarij" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever revolts against a ruler from the Muslim rulers, then he is a Khaarijiyy (one of the Khawaarij).”</strong> Whoever departs from obedience to the one in authority and rebels against his authority, using the excuse that the person in authority has sins and has acts contrary to the legislation, as is done by the Khawaarij; then he has the ruling of the Khawaarij. And the Khawaarij are a deviant group which first sprouted in the time of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> when Thul-Khuwaysirah came and said to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, when he saw him dividing the booty, he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do justice O Muhammad, for you have not been just!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
“Woe to you! Then who will do justice if I do not do justice?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when that man departed he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There will emerge from the progeny of this one&#8230;”</strong></span> Meaning from his type <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“&#8230;a people; you will belittle your Prayers in comparison to their Prayers, and your worship in comparison to their worship. They will recite the Qur·aan but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots straight through the game. So wherever you find them then fight them, for in fighting them there is reward for those who fight them.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to fight against them and that is in order to stop their evil from the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case if they come out with weapons and they bear arms, but as for their merely manifesting the view of the Khawaarij and speaking with it but not fighting and not bearing arms, then in that case we rebuke them and we make clear to them their misguidance but we do not fight against them. However, if they gain strength and they start to fight against the Muslims then it is not permissible then for the Muslims to leave them. Rather it is obligatory upon the person in authority to fight against them, and it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they should be along with the person in authority against them, just as occurred in the khilaafah (Caliphate) of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he fought against the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And the Companions joined him and they fought against the Khawaarij along with him until they killed them in the worst manner; and through that he attained the reward which Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> promised in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed there is reward in fighting against them for those who fight against them.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from the virtues of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, and his virtues are many. And from them is that he fought against the Khawaarij and he implemented the statement of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> regarding them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and his death will be the death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Khawaarij, they are the people who broke the unity of obedience and they revolted against the person in authority. And likewise they are the ones who declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins, kabaa·ir, which are less than shirk. So therefore they have two signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first sign</strong> is their khurooj (rebelling) against the person in authority over the Muslims and their attempting to remove the one in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second sign</strong> is that they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of kabaa·ir (major sins), which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what led them to this is ghuluww (extremism), and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And therefore, the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against ghuluww (extremism) saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware of ghuluww (extremism) for those who came before you were only destroyed on account of ghuluww (extremism/going beyond the limits.)”</span></strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is adding to the Religion and adding to that which is legislated with regard to criticising an evil. This is ghuluww (extremism) which led the Khawaarij to what occurred from them. They had ghuluww, went overboard, in criticising an evil to such an extent that they split apart from unity of obedience and they went beyond the limit, to extremes in worship to the extent that they declared those people who commit major sins from the Muslims to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;he has contradicted the narrations&#8230;”</strong> Meaning the ahaadeeth which occur from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to adhering to obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;and his death will be a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning because he has a characteristic from the characteristic of the Times of Ignorance (times of jaahiliyyah) because the Arabs in the times of jaahiliyyah (the Times of Ignorance) used to be dispersed within different tribes; they had no single ruler who would unite them, rather, each tribe would be independent on its own and they would make surprise attacks upon other tribes. And they did not unite except after Allaah sent Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He called them to Islaam so they accepted Islaam and they came to be beneath a single banner. And therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember the favour of Allaah upon you that you were previously enemies, so He joined between your hearts and through His favour you became brothers.</strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when you were few and you were weak upon the earth, fearing that the people would snatch you away, and Allaah gave you shelter and He strengthened you with His aid and He provided provision for you from the good and pure things so that you may give thanks.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fruits of obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims, all these good things come about through that: establishment of security, the ability to seek provisions and the people being able to travel far and wide to seek provisions on account of the roads being safe. But when there is a state of fear, then in that case the people do not travel, they do not buy and sell out of fear for themselves. So these are from the virtues of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body) and of obedience to the one in authority. As for revolting against the one in authority and splitting away from obedience then that brings about the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> It causes the splitting of the United Body of the Muslims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The shedding of blood without right</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> The enemy overcoming; because the enemy are happy at this. And therefore you will find the disbelievers being joyful at the splitting of the Muslims, and they bring about splits between the Muslims and they aid the deviant groups. They provide them with weapons and they aid them with planning so that they rebel against the United Body of the Muslims, and splitting occurs among the Muslims, so that they can seize them as plunder, as happens. So all of this is a result of disunity and of disobeying the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and of rebelling against the ones in authority over the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, one who has no ruler, then he is like a person who lives in jaahiliyyah (Times of Ignorance) and if he dies then his death is like that of the Times of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, but rather it means that he has a characteristic from the characteristics of the Days of Ignorance in that he does not enter under obedience to a ruler; instead he lives in chaos, <em>fowdaa</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 25 : Point 28</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-khilaafah (the Caliphate) remains within the Quraysh until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> (may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security) descends.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If more than person contends about who is going to take over the rulership and each one of them is fitting for rulership then precedence is given to the Qurashiyy (the person who is from the tribe of Quraysh) because of his special quality over others; because of his <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The rulers are from the Quraysh.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give precedence to the Quraysh and do not give precedence to yourselves over them.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the man of Quraysh is righteous and contention occurs with regard to who will take charge, then the man of Quraysh is given precedence because of the fact that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave that instruction and because the Companions when Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> passed away and when the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah) said, “There should be a leader from us and a leader from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded <strong>“The Arabs (in general) they will not submit regarding this affair except to this group of Quraysh.”</strong> [06] So therefore they gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (pledge of allegiance) to Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and then after him to `Umar and after him to `Uthmaan and after him to `Aliyy and after him to Mu`aawiyah and after him to Banoo Umayyah and after them to Banoo `Abbaas and all of them were from Quraysh. However, if the matter is completed and concluded, then obedience becomes binding even if he is not a man of Quraysh. Or if the man of Quraysh is not suitable for rulership, for the mere fact that he is from Quraysh does not automatically give him the right to rulership unless along with being from the Quraysh, he is a righteous man and there is not already an established ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> descends.”</strong> This is an indication of the fact that `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> when he descends, he will descend and the ruler of the Muslims will be Muhammad ibn `Abdillaah al-Mahdee, who will be from the family of al-Hasan ibn `Aliyy ibn Abee Taalib. So this shows that the last of the rulers will indeed be from Quraysh and the first of them was from Quraysh, and he was Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and this is what is implemented as far as possible as we have mentioned. And if no-one is found from Quraysh, this does not mean that leadership passes away. Or if someone who is not from the Quraysh establishes the affair and he becomes the leader, and the person is suitable, it doesn’t mean that we remove him and we say you are not suitable for it. So it is obligatory to have awareness of these matters. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This hadeeth is reported by at-Tayaalisiyy in his Musnad and Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad and anNasaa·ee in as-Sunanul-Kubraa and by Ibn Abee `Aasim in (his book) as-Sunnah and Aboo Ya`laa in his Musnad and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa. It was declared authentic by ad-Diyaa· in his book alMukhtaarah (which included just those hadeeth that according to him were authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this hadeeth is a hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and the narration of Ibn Abee `Aasim mentions from Anas ibn Maalik, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came to us whilst we were in the house of a man from the Ansaar so he took hold of the two doorposts and he said, “The rulers are from Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this narration, “It is a hadeeth that is saheeh (authentic). “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] This is also reported by Ibn Abee `Aasim in his book as-Sunnah and at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamulKabeer as occurs in the book Majma` uz-Zawaa·id.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Majma` uz-Zawaa·id: a book that includes the extra narrations outside the six books, extra narrations of the books of at-Tabaraaniyy, Aboo Ya`laa and Musnad of Imaam Ahmad and other books, hadeeth that are additional to the hadeeth in these six books; al-Haythamee’s Majma` uzZawaa·id. So this hadeeth is included there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this hadeeth is a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn as-Saa·ib <em>radiyAllaahu`anhumaa</em> and declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in Saheehul-Jaami`.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This occurs in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaariyy as part of a long hadeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, (no. 6830) with the wording, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They won’t accept and recognise this affair except for these people of Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said on this point, “Al-khilaafah is within the Quraysh until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> descends. And there occurs in that regard the hadeeth reported by Ahmad, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The khilaafah is to be in the Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“However, this is to be taken to refer to khilaafah where there is a choice. But as for where there is a man who fights the people with those who are along with him and he gains authority and the people submit to him after he has overcome them, then it is obligatory to obey him whether he is from Quraysh or whether he is other than from the Quraysh, whether he is righteous or whether he is sinful.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“This is the `aqeedah (creed and belief) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah who hold the obligation of that, and that it is not permissible for anyone to rebel against him after the affair is settled for him and it is settled and secured for him, even if he is sinful or wicked (then it is still obligatory to obey him).&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the proofs for that have already preceded. From them is the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy and from them the hadeeth of `Urfuja (with the wording),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes to you when your affair is united intending to split your unity and to separate your united body then kill him whoever it may be.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“So it is obligatory to hold this as creed and belief and to act upon it and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith, but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(still) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">pants. Such is the parable of the people who reject Our Ayat. So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect.Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat, and used to wrong themselves.</span></strong> (Qur&#8217;an Al-A&#8217;raf 07, Verses 175-177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that Allah&#8217;s statement,<strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away</strong>) <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Is about Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217; a man from the Children of Israel.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah and several other narrators narrated this statement from Mansur who got it from Ibn Mas`ud. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah narrated that Qatadah said that Ibn `Abbas said,<span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;He is Sayfi, son of Ar-Rahib.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah commented that Ka`b said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was a man from Al-Balqla&#8217; (a province of Jordan) who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name. He used to live in Bayt Al-Maqdis with the tyrants.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217;, a man from Yemen whom Allah had given the knowledge of His Ayat, but he abandoned them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Dinar said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was one of the scholars of the Children of Israel whose supplication was acceptable. They used to seek his lead in suplication in times of difficulty. Allah&#8217;s Prophet Musa sent him to the King of Madyan to call him to Allah. That king appeased him and gave him land and gifts, and he reverted from the religion of Musa and followed the king&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Imran bin `Uyaynah narrated that `Husayn said that `Imran bin Al-Harith said that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;.&#8221;</span> Similar was said by Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Therefore, it is well-known that this honorable Ayah was revealed about a man from the Children of Israel in ancient times, according to Ibn Mas`ud and several others among the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;He is a man from the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem) whose name was Bal`am and who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah also reported that Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;When Musa and those with him went to the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem), the cousins of Bal`am and his people came to him and said, `Musa is a strong man, and he has many soldiers. If he gains the upper hand over us, we will be destroyed. Therefore, supplicate to Allah that He prevents Musa and those with him from prevailing over us.&#8217; Bal`am said, `If I supplicate to Allah that He turns back Musa and those with him, I will lose in this life and the Hereafter.&#8217; They kept luring him until he supplicated against Musa and his people, and Allah took away what he bestowed on him (of knowledge). Hence Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up).&#8221;</strong>&#8216; Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires.)</strong> Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith)</strong> from the filth of this earthly life through the Ayat that We gave him knowledge of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he clung to the earth)</strong>, he became interested in the adornment of this life and its delights. He indulged in the lusts of life and its joys and was deceived by it, just as life deceived others like him, without sound comprehension or a good mind. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr that when Musa entered the land of Bani Canaan in the area of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), the people of Bal`am came to him, saying, &#8220;This is Musa, son of `Imran with the Children of Israel. He wants to drive us out from our land, kill us and replace us with the Children of Israel. We are your people and have no other dwelling area. You are a person whose supplication is acceptable (to Allah), so go out and supplicate to Allah against them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Woe to you! Here is Allah&#8217;s Prophet (Musa) with whom the angels and believers are! How can I supplicate against them when I know from Allah what I know&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have no other dwelling area.&#8221; So they kept luring and begging him until he was tempted by the trial and went on his donkey towards Mount Husban, which was behind the Israelite military barracks. When he proceeded on the Mount for a while, the donkey sat down and refused to proceed. He got off the donkey and struck it until it stood up again and he rode it. The donkey did the same after a little while, and he struck it again until it stood up&#8230; So he proceeded and tried to supplicate against Musa and his people. However, Allah made his tongue mention his people with evil and the Children of Israel with good instead of his people, who protested, &#8220;O Bal`am! What are you doing You are supplicating for them and against us!&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is against my will. This is a matter that Allah has decided.&#8221; He then said to them, as his tongue was made to loll out of his mouth, &#8220;Now I have lost this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; This Ayah was revealed about the story of Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away.)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he (still) pants.)</strong> Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions regarding the meaning of this Ayah. Some scholars said that it refers to the end of Bal`am&#8217;s tongue which flickered out of his mouth, as in the story narrated from Ibn Ishaq, from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr. Therefore, his example is the example of the dog, its tongue pants regardless of whether it is driven away or not. It was also said that the meaning here is a parable of this man &#8212; and his like &#8212; concerning their misguidance, persisting the wrong path and not being able to benefit from faith or comprehend what they are being called to. So his example is that of a dog which pants whether it was driven away or left alone. The person described here does not benefit from the advice or the call to faith, just as if the advice and call never occurred. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(It is the same to them (disbelievers) whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.)</strong></span>(2:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whether you ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them &#8212; (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness &#8212; Allah will not forgive them.)</span> </strong>(9:80) and similar Ayat. It was also said that the meaning here, is that the heart of the disbeliever, the hypocrite and the wicked is weak and devoid of guidance. Therefore, it keeps faltering. Similar was narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect)</strong> Allah said next to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may)</strong> the Children of Israel, who have knowledge ot the story of Bal`am and what happened to him when Allah allowed him to stray and expelled him from His mercy. Allah favored him by teaching him His Greatest Name, by which, if He is asked, He will grant, and if He is called upon, He answers. But Bal`am used it in disobedience to Allah and invoked Him against His own party of the people of faith, followers of His servant and Messenger during that time, Musa, the son of `Imran, peace be upon him, whom Allah spoke to directly,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> and avoid Bal`am&#8217;s behavior, for Allah has given the Jews knowledge and made them superior to the bedouins surrounding them. He gave them the description of Muhammad ﷺ which would allow them to recognize him, as they recognize their own children. They, among people, have the most right to follow, aid and support Muhammad ﷺ , in obedience to their Prophets who informed them of him and commanded them to follow him. Therefore, whoever among them defies the knowledge in their Books or hides it from the servants, Allah will place disgrace on him in this life, followed by humiliation in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat.)</strong> Allah says, evil is the example of the people who deny Our Ayat in that they are equated with dogs that have no interest but to collect food and satisfy lusts.&#8217; Therefore, whoever goes out of the area of knowledge and guidance, and seeks satisfaction for his lusts and vain desires, is just like a dog; what an evil example. The Sahih recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The evil example is not suitable for us: he who goes back on his gift is just like the dog that eats its vomit.)</strong> Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and they used to wrong themselves.)</strong> means, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves by rejecting guidance, not obeying the Lord, being content with this life that will soon end, all the while seeking to fulfill desires and obey lusts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(178. Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the guided one, and whomsoever He sends astray, &#8212; then those! They are the losers.) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, whomever He leads aright, then none can lead him to misguidance, and whomever He leads astray, will have acquired failure, loss and sure misguidance. Verily, whatever Allah wills occurs; and whatever He does not will, does not occur. A Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reads,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(All praise is due to Allah, Whom we praise and seek help, guidance and forgiveness from. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils within ourselves and from the burden of our evil deeds. He whom Allah guides, will never be misled; and he whom He misguides, will never have one who will guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah without partners and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 25 : Point 27</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the Hajj and fighting jihaad along with the ruler continue. And the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer behind them is allowed; and after it six <em>rak`ahs</em> are prayed, separating each pair of<em> rak`ahs</em>. This was the saying of Ahmad ibn Hanbal.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-hajj-and-fighting-jihaad-along-with-the-ruler-continue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The functions carried out by the ruler are many, and the place to find them enumerated and to find them mentioned together, and where you can acquaint yourself with them is the books on the rulings relating to rulership (<em>al-ahkaamus-sultaaniyyah</em>) such as alAhkaamus-Sultaaniyyah of al-Maawardiyy and al-Ahkaamus-Sultaaniyyah of Aboo Ya`laa al-Hanbaliyy and books which have been written on this topic which explain the functions of the ruler. And it is mentioned in the books of <em>fiqh</em> and in the books of <em>`aqaa∙id</em> (creed and belief) also as occurs here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Firstly</strong> </span>(from these functions), is that he (the ruler) is in charge of carrying out the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer and the two `Eed Prayers and the Muslims pray behind him unless he chooses to appoint someone from the Scholars or from the Students of Knowledge to lead the people in Prayer. However, the basic principle is that he (the ruler) has more right to leading the Prayer with regard to the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer (Friday Prayer) and the two `Eed Prayers. So if he appoints someone to do this then he may do so, and this is what action is upon at present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>, is that he is the one who establishes the Hajj and he leads the people performing Hajj. And he is in charge of them and he looks into any problems they may have.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>, is establishment of jihaad in Allaah’s cause; this is from the functions carried out by the ruler. He is the one who gives command for it and he is the one who organises the flags and he is the one who chooses the armies and those who are going to fight. And he appoints the commanders and he appoints the squadrons (army units) and he appoints the armies and he provides the fighters with weaponry. And he gives them directions with regard to fighting the enemy and he specifies the direction in which they are to attack.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So jihaad is from the roles of the ruler; and jihaad is not fowdaa (chaos or anarchy) such that everyone who wants to take up arms and go and fight and attack does so and says, “I am fighting jihaad in Allaah’s cause!” This is not jihaad in Allaah’s cause. Jihaad in Allaah’s cause is properly arranged and it is regulated by legislated regulations (of the Sharee`ah, the Islaamic Law). But as for when it is opened up to chaos then it becomes mere destruction, and its harm becomes more than its benefit, if there is actually any benefit in it at all. So the harm resulting from it is greater. So affairs have regulating principles and jihaad is a tremendous affair. It requires that it is correctly regulated and it needs to be restricted by the rulings which are mentioned for jihaad in the Book and the Sunnah and in the speech of the People of Knowledge. The matter is not of fowdaa (chaos or anarchy) such that a person comes from the callers to fitnah (discord) and sets himself up as the leader for those people who are extremists or radicals or ignorant people, those who do not know, he becomes their leader and he says, “We will fight jihaad in Allaah’s cause.” This is counted as being one of the things that cause harm to Islaam and to the Muslims; and this is not jihaad because it is not restricted by the regulating principles which govern jihaad. And if it is not restricted by the regulating principles of jihaad then it just becomes fasaad (corruption) and it is not jihaad. And everything which exceeds its due limits then it turns over and it becomes its opposite. So they now say to those who criticise them, “You are preventing jihaad in Allaah’s cause.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say, “We are not preventing jihaad in Allaah’s cause. However, we say that it is essential that jihaad is regulated by its legislated regulating principles, whereas what you people are doing is fowdaa (chaos) and it is not jihaad and Allaah did not command with it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So establishment of the Hajj and fighting jihaad and the <em>Jumu`ah</em> and the `Eed Prayer, these are from the functions of the waleeul-amr (the person in authority).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And praying the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer behind them is permissible,”</strong> meaning, even if they have fisq (they commit open sins), even if they have acts of disobedience, still the person prays behind them because Prayer behind them retains unity and also a faasiq (an open sinner), if he does something that is good then you do good along with him. And for this reason when they said to `Uthmaan radiyAllaahu `anhu whilst he was being besieged, “So and so leads the people in Prayer and he is not the imaam (the ruler), rather he is just an imaam of fitnah (he is just the leader of discord/tribulation).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So `Uthmaan radiyAllaahu `anhu said, “O son of my brother, if the people do what is good then do that which is good along with them and if they do something evil then avoid their evil.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if he prays then we pray along with him if he is the one in authority, even if he has open sins or acts of disobedience, because of the welfare which lies in doing that. Because the Prayer is worship and the sinful person, faasiq, if he prays then he should be encouraged upon that, supplication made for him. And the Companions they prayed behind rulers who had points against them such as al-Hajjaaj and others. The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam prayed behind them in compliance with command of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in order to retain unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he should pray after it six <em>rak`ahs</em>.”</strong> This is a matter of fiqh; it comes here in accordance with the mention of the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer. So the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer has no raatibah (regular Sunnah Prayer) before it. So whoever comes to the mosque then he should pray whatever is easy for him and then sit and wait (for the imaam to come out). And if he continues praying until the imaam attends then that is more excellent upon the basis that this is unrestricted optional Prayer; it has no connection to the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer itself. As for the raatibah (regular Sunnah Prayer) of the <em>Jumu`ah</em> then it comes after it. Its least amount is two <em>rak`ahs</em> and its greatest amount, in what is famous, is four <em>rak`ahs</em> with two salutations (two salaams). And there comes in one saying (within the Hanbaliyy math.hab) that it is six <em>rak`ahs</em> with three salutations. Therefore, its least amount will be two <em>rak`ahs</em> and its greatest amount is six <em>rak`ahs</em>, or four <em>rak`ahs</em> as is what is famous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“He separates between each pair of two <em>rak`ahs</em>. This was the saying of Ahmad ibn Hanbal.”</strong>[02] Meaning, that does not mean that he prays six <em>rak`ahs</em> altogether with one salaam (salutation at the end of it). Rather six <em>rak`ahs</em>; every two <em>rak`ahs</em> with one salaam (after it); or four <em>rak`ahs</em> with each pair of <em>rak`ahs</em> before the salaam, and this is better. And it’s being ascribed to Imaam Ahmad is because the author (Imaam alBarbahaaree) was a Hanbaliyy (meaning from the students of the students of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) and he was well acquainted with the position of Imaam Ahmad. This was a report from Ahmad that it is six rak`ahs. What is famous is that it is four rak`ahs. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 695) from `Ubaydillaah ibn `Adiyy ibn Khiyaar with it (this narration)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] There occurs in the Masaa·il of `Abdullaah, son of Imaam Ahmad, that `Abdullaah said, “I asked my father, ‘How many <em>rak`ahs</em> should a man pray after <em>Jumu`ah</em>?’ I said, ‘What is more beloved to you (that he should pray)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said, ‘If he wishes, he can pray four after the <em>Jumu`ah</em> and if he wishes he can pray six; except that he should give the salutation after each two <em>rak`ahs</em>. That is the saying with regard to all of the (optional) Prayers of the day; all of them are in pairs.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There are a number of books of the students of Imaam Ahmad that report matters of fiqh from him and there are a number of separate books in that regard. There is the Masaa·il of his son `Abdullaah and Masaa·il of his student Aboo Daawood and Masaa·il of a number of other of his students. Each one is called the Masaa·il of Imaam Ahmad by such and such from his students. This one referred to here is the Masaa·il (The Questions of Fiqh) put to Imaam Ahmad, collected by his son `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In Riyaadus-Saaliheen we had the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar reported by alBukhaariyy and Muslim that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam after the <em>Jumu`ah</em> entered his house and prayed two<em> rak`ahs</em>. Likewise in Saheeh Muslim there’s a hadeeth that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “When one of you has prayed the <em>Jumu`ah</em> let him pray four after it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned this issue in his explanation and mentioned there are evidences for two and there are evidences of four.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “And the six (praying six) is one report from Imaam Ahmad and it was the saying, from the Companions, of `Aliyy ibn Abee Taalib and Aboo Moosaa radiyAllaahu `anhumaa; and from the taabi`een (it was the saying of) `Ataa and Mujaahid (the two great imaams of Makkah from the taabi`een; `Ataa bin Abee Rabaah and Mujaahid ibn Jabr) and of Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan and it was the saying of Sufyaan ath-Thowree, great imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad preferred the saying, as is the view of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, that what is preferred in his view is: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">if a person prays it in his house he prays two <em>rak`ahs</em> and if he prays it in the mosque he prays four.</span></strong> (He said,) “That is more established with regard to the evidence behind it.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and an evil way.)</strong> meaning, a terrible way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, <strong>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).&#8221;</strong> The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; But the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Come close)</strong> The young man came to him, and he ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Sit down)</strong> so he sat down. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their mothers.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your daughter)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their daughters. )</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your sister)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their sisters.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your paternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your maternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.)</strong> Then the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.)</strong> After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And hearing and obeying the rulers in that which Allaah loves and is pleased with. So whoever becomes the <em>khaleefah</em> through the consensus of the people for him and their being pleased with him, then he is the <em>ameerul-mu&#8217;mineen </em></strong>(Chief of the Believers)<strong>. It is not permissible for anyone to spend a night thinking that he has no ruler over him whether he </strong>(the ruler) <strong>be righteous or sinful.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/hearing-and-obeying-the-rulers-in-that-which-allaah-loves-and-is-pleased-with" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>u<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool</em> (fundamental principles) of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> that are established in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <strong>hearing </strong>and<strong> obeying</strong> those in authority of the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you</strong></span>. (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst you &#8211; Meaning from the Muslims. And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>“I council you with <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah), and with hearing and obeying; even if a slave takes charge of you.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,<br />
<strong><span style="color:#003300;">“Even if an Abyssinian slave takes charge of you.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,<br />
<span style="color:#003300;"><strong>“Even if it be a slave whose limbs are cut off.”</strong></span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning with his feet and hands cut off. As long as he is<em> waleeul-amr</em> (the one in authority) it is obligatory to obey him upon good. So this is from the <em>usool</em> (fundamentals) of <em>`aqeedah</em>. And the one who revolts against the Muslim rulers, he is from the <em>daalleen</em>, those people who are astray. Either he will be a <em>khaarijiyy</em> (one of the Khawaarij) or he will be a <em>mu`taziliyy</em> (one of the Mu`tazilah) or a person of some false and futile sectarian way contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And hearing and obeying the rulers with regard to that which Allaah loves and is pleased with.”</strong> With this restriction: with regard to that which Allaah loves and is pleased with. As for <em>ma`siyah</em> (sin) then they are not obeyed in that. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to the creation in disobedience to the Creator.”</strong> </span>[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he<em> `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“Obedience is only in what is good.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not mean that if the one in authority orders a sin to be committed that he is to be stripped of his rulership; rather, just that he is not obeyed upon this sin, but he is still to be obeyed in whatever is not a sin and his rulership remains, and he is obeyed in that which is not a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever becomes their <em>khaleefah</em> by consensus of the people upon him and their being pleased with him then he is <em>ameerul-mu·mineen</em> (Chief of the Believers.).”</strong> This is an explanation of how rulership comes about because <em>imaamah</em> (rulership) it comes about in one of a number of ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> </span>is that which the author mentioned, and it is one whom the Muslims choose. And what is meant by those who choose the ruler is <em>ahlul-halli wal `aqd</em>, the people of authority and influence, with regard to the Scholars (the `<em>ulamaa</em>·) and the `<em>umaraa</em>· (the governors) and the people in charge of political affairs of the state and the army chiefs.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> And it does not mean that choosing the ruler is for everyone with regard to the children and the women and the town dwellers and the bedouins</span>, because the people follow on from the people of authority and influence. So if the people of authority and influence choose a ruler, it becomes obligatory upon the rest of the people to obey him. And this is just as occurred with the <em>khilaafah</em> of Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq; because the Companions, after the passing away of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, they were agreed upon giving the pledge (<em>bay`ah</em>) to as-Siddeeq. So the rest of the nation, they followed on from those who chose as-Siddeeq, and the affair was not opened up to everyone to have a share in choosing, because this is from the role specific to the people of authority and influence. So the Muslims chose Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, who was the best of them, and this choice they made has evidences in the Sunnah of the Messenger<em> sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, that Aboo Bakr was the most excellent one of the Companions unrestrictedly; no-one disagreed about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>secondly</strong>, that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave indications that he would succeed him. From them is that when he fell sick with his final illness he put him forward for the Prayer to lead the Muslims in the place of Prayer of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; [06] and he stood in the standing place of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is an indication that he would be their imaam in the khilaafah also, just as he was their imaam in the Prayer. So therefore, they chose Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>; and they said, “<em>Should it be the case that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was pleased with you for our Religion and that we are not pleased with you for our worldly affairs?</em>” And the pledge to him, the <em>bay`ah</em>, was carried out and the Companions were agreed upon that, those who were involved in directly choosing; and those who were not directly involved then he is a follower. And the Muslims are a single united body and a single hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The second matter:</strong></span> is that when Aboo Bakr was at the point of death he chose `Umar ibnul-Khattaab and specified him to take his place; so the Muslims heard him and obeyed him. And this is the second way from the ways of establishing rulership, and it is that the person in authority chooses the one who will take charge after his death, just as Aboo Bakr did when he chose `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The third matter:</strong> </span>If one of the Muslims overcomes and gains authority and causes the people to submit to his rulership then he will be their chief and ruler as occurred regarding `<strong>Abdul-Malik ibn Marwaan</strong>. Because when there was disagreement after the death of Yazeed ibn Mu`aawiyah, then `Abdul Malik ibn Marwaan ibn al-Hakam took control of the affair [07]. And he was a man bold/astute, determined, strong and Allaah brought about benefit through him. And the pledge to him (the bay`ah) was established and the Muslims heard him and obeyed so in that lay good for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the ways in which rulership of the ruler can be established; either by the people of authority and influence choosing, or by the previous ruler specifying the one who will take charge after him or by someone from the Muslims taking control such that he becomes their ruler and the people submit to him and obey and comply with him, then in that case it is not permissible for anyone to split and break the unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“by consensus of the Muslims,”</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;">it should not be understood from this that it is essential for all of the Muslims to make the choice</span>. However, that will be attained by the consensus of the people of authority and influence as happened in the time of Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and as happened with regard to the khilaafah of `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>; for the ones who chose him were the <em>ahlush-shooraa</em> (People of the Council) and they were the remainder of the ten promised Paradise. They chose him, so his rulership was established and no-one raised any objection to that. Rather, they all agreed in consensus to the rulership of `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible for anyone to spend a night thinking that there is no ruler over him whether he be a righteous person or a wicked/sinful person.”</strong> This is a very important matter, and it is that it is not permissible for a person to rebel against the United Body of the Muslims and to separate away from obedience. For if he does that <strong>“and he spends a single night and he has no ruler”</strong> whose rulership he believes (meaning, not believing he has rulership over him), then this person <strong>“has thrown off the rope of Islaam from his neck.”</strong> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he was along with the Muslims and connected to the Muslims but when he rebelled/went out of obedience to the ruler, then he cut his link with the Muslims; just like the small lambs which used to have a long rope which would have loops coming off it, and the heads of the lambs would be put in these loops to safeguard them from being lost; and they were called <em>ar-ribq</em> (nooses). So the Muslims being united upon a ruler is likened to that. So whoever departs from obedience to the ruler, then he has thrown off this noose from his neck and exposed himself to becoming lost and to the wolves and to the winds. It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, its meaning is that he has split away from the united body (the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) and he has exited from obedience, so he has become like an animal that has left his connecting rope and has exposed itself to wild animals and to being snatched away or stolen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it should not be said, <span style="color:#ff0000;">“I haven’t given any pledge of allegiance and I have no ruler,”</span> for you are just one of the Muslims, so when the people of influence and authority give the pledge then you follow on from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This is part of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and its checking has already preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithiyy and Ibn Maajah and others and declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 693) from Anas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1837) from a hadeeth of Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em> (it says Umm Mihsan and it should say Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wordings of the hadeeth reported by Muslim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Even if it be an Abyssinian slave with his limbs cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim (no. 1837) from a hadeeth of Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em> and also reported by Muslim (no. 648) from Aboo Tharr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad in the Musnad and at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamul-Kabeer and al-Qudaa`ee in the Musnad of Shihaab and others. And the wording here is that of at-Tabaraaniyy and of al-Qudaa`ee. And the wording of Ahmad is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to a created being in disobedience to Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator’s side point: And this is from the hadeeth of `Imraan Ibn Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. It was declared saheeh, authentic, by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in As-Saheehah (no. 179)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basis of this occurs in the two Saheehs as a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 7145) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1840) as a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and the wording of Muslim is, <strong>“There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah. Obedience is only in what is good.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim (no.418) from a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah<em> radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> He took charge in the year 65 and his khilaafah lasted until year 86 or 87; Allaahu A`lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Muslim reports in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar with the wording, <strong>“And whoever dies and he does not have pledge to the ruler upon his neck, he will die a death of the days of ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration from Ibn `Umar reported by al-Haakim in (his book) al-Mustadrak upon the Two Saheehs (that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“Whoever departs from the United Body of the Muslims </span></strong><span style="color:#333300;">(the Jamaa`ah)</span><strong><span style="color:#333300;"> by a hand span then he has thrown off the rope of Islaam from his neck until he returns.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“And whoever dies and does not have a ruler of the Jamaa’ah </span></strong><span style="color:#333300;">(the United Body of Muslims)</span><strong><span style="color:#333300;"> upon him then his death will be a death of the days of ignorance.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was mentioned by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in As-Saheehah affirming it under hadeeth no. 984 and it was declared by Shaykh Muqbil <em>rahimahullaah</em> in his checking of al-Mustadrak that he said this hadeeth is to the standard of Muslim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

When we covered his head with it his feet were uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it his head was uncovered. So the Prophet said, ‘Cover his head with it, and place idhkhir (a sweet smelling rush) upon his feet.’”</strong> (Reported by al- Bukhaaree (Eng. trans.5/281/no. 408), Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/446/no. 2050 ), Ahmad and an- Nasaa’ee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 23 : Point 25 (Part C)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(Imaam al-Barbahaaree continued)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Then the best of the people after them are those who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for a day, a month or a year or for less than that or more than that. We supplicate for mercy upon them and we mention their virtues and we withhold from speaking about any slips they made. We do not mention a single one of them except favourably because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“When my Companions are mentioned then withhold.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah said, “Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word then he is a person following desires.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F367212290&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/refraining-from-abusing-the-companions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-suhbah (Companionship) varies; so from it there was long Companionship and being constantly with the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for a long time. Or whoever accompanied him for a short time; however such a person still has the virtue of Companionship even if his Companionship was short in length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“We supplicate for mercy for them and we mention their virtues and we withhold from speaking about any slips they made.”</strong> Their haqq (right) upon us is that we supplicate for Allaah’s Pleasure upon them, and that we supplicate for Allaah’s Mercy upon them, and that we take them as examples to follow, and that we praise them. And we withhold our tongues from attacking them or a single one of them, or from delving into whatever occurred between them with regard to tribulations and wars; because each one of them was a mujtahid (striving to the best of his ability to attain the Truth). So some of them were a mujtahid (one who strove) and attained what was correct, then he will receive two rewards. And others from them were a mujtahid (one who strove to attain the Truth) but made a mistake, and for him there will be a single reward and the mistake is forgiven. Then also they have tremendous deeds which wipe away whatever occurred from some of them with regard to mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“We do not mention anyone of them except favourably&#8230;”</strong> because they intended the Truth and they strove to attain it; each one of them acted upon his own ijtihaad (striving). So some of them attained what was correct and some of them made a mistake, for which he will be forgiven, and all of them were Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we do not enter into what occurred between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Carefully reflect upon this aayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who come after them</strong></span>. (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning after the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan and do not place in our hearts any ill-feeling towards those who believed.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah rahimahullaah said in that regard, “From the usool (fundamental principles) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is the sincerity, secureness, the soundness of their hearts and their tongues towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The soundness of their hearts’;</strong> so they do not hate a single one of them. And ‘the sincerity and soundness of their tongues’ means that they do not speak against a single one of them and they do not belittle him. And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic hadeeth, “Do not abuse my Companions for, by the One in whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of Mount Uhud in gold in charity, it would not reach the hands full of one of them, nor even a half of it.” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do not abuse my Companions,”</strong> but then there comes one who is defective in intellect, whose eemaan is shaky, who is following his desires and he speaks against the Companions of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So this person if he is from the deviant sects then we would not speak at length about him. However, the problem is when he ascribes himself to the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah and yet says, “This is from historical verification.” And do you have the duty put upon you of historical verification such that you have to enter into something which you do not know about and which results in dangerous consequences, and such that you cause the people to have doubts about the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and you provoke the hearts of the people against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>? So what is obligatory is to withhold about whatever disputes occurred between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “When my Companions are mentioned then withhold.”</strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even more explicit than it is his sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s saying, “Do not abuse my Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a prohibition of abusing any one of the Companions. So what is obligatory is that we supplicate for mercy for them and that we supplicate for forgiveness for them, acting upon His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them, they say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan.”</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that we withhold our tongues and our pens from speaking against the Companions of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; and that we defend them and we refute whoever belittles a single one of the Companions, and we nullify his saying because it is contrary to the correct `aqeedah (creed and belief), the `aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam says in al-Waasitiyyah</strong>, “What is related from them is either not authentic, so that is just lies and reports added with an evil intent; and what is authentic from it, then that person is a <em>mujtahid</em>; one striving to attain the truth. And a <em>mujtahid</em>, if he attains what is correct, then he receives two rewards, and if he makes a mistake then he will still get the one reward. And also they have such virtues that will drown out and cover over whatever occurred from some of them with regard to mistakes. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said regarding Haatib ibn Abee Balta`ah <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he applied his own ijtihaad and he wrote a letter to the people of Makkah, and `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> said, “Let me strike off the neck of this hypocrite!” So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> responded, “You do not know O `Umar, perhaps Allaah looked upon the people of Badr and said ‘Do whatever you wish for I have forgiven you.’” [05] This Companion was one of those who was present at Badr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah said, ‘Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word then he is a person following desires.’’</strong>’ Because no-one speaks against them except a person of desires and one who is trying to render the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> open to attack.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have love and respect and honour for them, and to recognise their value, and to take them as a role model to follow because they are the best of generations, and because they saw the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they believed in him, and they accompanied him and they aided him and they fought jihaad along with him, and they carried the knowledge from him. So they are the most excellent ones of this nation. Indeed, they are the most excellent ones of the whole of the creation after the Prophets because Allaah specifically chose them for Companionship of His Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the last of the Prophets and the most excellent one of the Messengers. So no-one attacks them except one who has in his heart ghill (ill-feeling) and hiqd (hidden hatred) towards Islaam. So he does not attack them because of their persons; rather, he will only attack them because of what they did with regard to aiding this Religion and conveying it faithfully to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who attacks them is only attacking on that account, because he has hidden hatred towards Islaam and feelings of vengeance towards Islaam, so he seeks to use this means to vent his anger, in order to sever the link of this nation with its Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; because they (Companions) are the intermediary between us and between the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this is the intent of those who attack them And therefore when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them, they say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan and do not place any ill-feeling in our hearts towards those who believed.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that those who attack them, or a single one of them, then it is just on account of ghill (ill-feeling), which he finds in his heart against them. And therefore Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah, the great imaam, said, “Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word, then he is a person following desires.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Hawaa</em> (Desires) is what leads him to do this, and the desire is their hatred and their malice towards them. So therefore you’ll find the worst of the people are those who make attacks upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and they have been exposed by their lies and by being made hated amongst the people. So no-one will see one of them except that he will have strong dislike for him because Allaah has placed hatred for them upon the earth. So no-one will see one of those who has hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> except that he will find himself having hatred towards them and loathing of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This will not harm the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and it will not harm Islaam. So the Companions, their worth and their reward is fully intact for them; and Islaam will persist and will be victorious, and all praise is for Allaah, and those people they only harm themselves. However, fear is for those people who read their books from those who do not have knowledge, so that something falls into his self against the Companions of Allah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he is affected by that. So how many of the sons of the Muslims have fallen prey to this on account of reading the books of those people? Because if he reads them, then he will be affected by them and he will find himself having some hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, or at the very least their value with him will be diminished and they will decrease in his estimation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what is to be feared for the youth of the Muslims and for those who are not firmly established with knowledge, that they will be influenced by these books which attack the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, especially since they are propagated now and they are embellished and they are brought out in the finest form with regard to printing and binding and they are promoted at book fairs. So they find that as an opportunity for them to spread and circulate attacks upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that an attack upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is an attack upon the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; for how could his Companions have been from those people when they describe them with the evil characteristics that they give to them? So this is indeed is an attack upon the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also it is a denial of the Book of Allaah, for Allaah praised the Companions in the tremendous Qur·aan in a number of aayahs, from them His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow; they will dwell therein forever. That is a tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9) aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah was pleased with those believers when they gave the pledge beneath the tree. So He knew what was in their hearts and therefore He sent down tranquility upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand and with plentiful booty for them to take.</b></span></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayahs 18-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating, seeking Bounty from Allaah and His Pleasure. Their sign is upon their faces from the effect of prostration. That was their example in the Towraat.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: That was their description in the Towraat. So they are mentioned in the Towraat, just as their Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And their description in the Injeel</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that which came down to `Eesaa,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Their description in the Injeel) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">is that of a plant which puts forth a side shoot so that it strengthens it and it grows strong and stands straight upon its stalk. It delights the sowers; so that Allaah, through them, enrages the disbelievers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that no one feels rage towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and no-one hates them except for a disbeliever, because of His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So that Allaah causes the disbelievers to be enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a sign of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). So having hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is disbelief and <em>nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) with a single word then he is a follower of desires.”</strong> Meaning if he speaks in belittlement of the Companions with a single word then he is a person of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is the case on account of a single word then how about a person who writes whole books in abuse of them and in maligning/speaking ill of them, and seeks out places where they could have erred and seeks to inflate their seriousness? How about this; if that is the case when a person who speaks a single word against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>), that he is a person who is a follower of desires, meaning he follows his desires? Because he does not speak except for some desire which he has in his soul and because of his having hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 22 : Point 25 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imaam al-Barbahaaree continued)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Then the most excellent of the people after them were: `Aliyy and Talhah and AzZubayr and Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas and Sa`eed ibn Zayd and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Owf and Aboo `Ubaydah `Aamir ibnul-Jarraah. And all of them were suitable to be the khaleefah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Then the most excellent of the people after them were the rest of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the first generation amongst whom he was sent, the first Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar; and they are those who prayed towards the two qiblahs (directions of Prayer).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F367188116&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-best-of-the-companions-after-the-khulafaa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the most excellent of the Companions after the three <em>khulafaa</em> are the rest of those ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and they are those whom the author mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“All of them were suitable to be the khaleefah”</strong> – meaning the people of the shoorah (council) whom `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu entrusted with choosing the next khaleefah after him. Because `Umar, when he was dying, appointed a council to choose the caliph so that the matter would rest with those who remained. Because each one of them was fitting to be a khaleefah, so he referred the affair to them, and they chose `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The first generation,”</strong> from the most excellent generations, and they were the generation in which the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent and they believed in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>al-as.haab</em> (Companions) is the plural of <em>sahaabiyyun</em>; and a <em>sahaabiyy</em> (a Companion) is whoever met the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam as a believer in him and he died upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• So a person who believed in the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but he did not meet him, then he is not a Companion such as an-Najjaashiyy [07] (the King of Abyssinia). He is counted as being from the <em>taabi`een</em>, the Successors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• As for one who met him but did not believe in him then he is not a Companion because the mushrikeen (people of shirk) and the disbelievers met the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but they did not believe in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And a person who met him and believed in him but then left Islaam then his Companionship is annulled/rendered null and void if he dies upon apostasy. As for if he repented, then Allaah accepted his repentance and his Companionship is restored.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore al-Haafiz ibn Hajar rahimahullaah, in his book an-Nukhbah [08], said, in definition of a Companion, “<strong>(He is) whoever met the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst believing in him and he died upon that, even if apostasy occurred in between (his meeting the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his dying), in the correct saying</strong>.” [09] Meaning in the most correct of the two sayings of the scholars. The second saying is that it abolishes his Companionship even if he repents because apostasy renders deeds which are before it null and void.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“The first generation, those amongst whom he was sent amongst the first Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and they are those who prayed towards the two qiblahs.”</strong> The Muhaajiroon (those who emigrated from Makkah) have precedence in mention over the Ansaar, so this shows that the Muhaajiroon have greater excellence through the excellence of performing hijrah (migration) in the cause of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because they left their homelands and their wealth. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, mentions the Muhaajiroon before the Ansaar in many aayahs just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar.</strong> </span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the poor and needy ones from the Muhaajireen, those who were forced out from their homes and their wealth; they left seeking the bounty from Allaah and His pleasure and they aid the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger. They are the true ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And also those who resided before them in al-Madeenah and believed.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the Ansaar. So He gives precedence to a mention of the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah certainly guided the Prophet and the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar to turn to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah117)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that the Muhaajiroon have greater excellence than the Ansaar. And <em>Ansaar</em> is the plural of <em>Ansaariyy</em>, and they are believers from (the tribes of) Ows and Khazraj, the people of Madeenah, those who gave the pledge to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam at al-`Aqabah. He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) migrated to them and they aided him and supported him and sheltered him and sheltered the Companions <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em> along with him. He, the Most High, said with regard to them, the Ansaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who resided in al-Madeenah before them and believed, they love those who emigrate to them and they do not find in their chests any resentment on account of what they had been given and they give precedence to them over themselves even though they themselves were in need. And whoever is saved from the avarice of his self then they are the successful ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To begin with they were called al-Ows wal-Khazraj (the tribes of Ows and Khazraj). Then when they gave the pledge to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam to aid him (nusrah), he called them al-Ansaar (the aiders or the helpers), meaning the aiders of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
