										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 3: I heard a man saying that when he yawns, he covers his mouth so that Satan may not enter inside him. He attributed this to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and claimed that it was mentioned in the Sahih (authentic) Book of Muslim. Is this true? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is Mustahab (desirable) for those who yawn to restrain it as much as possible and cover their mouths. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>When one of you yawns, you should try to restrain it with the help of your hand, since it is Satan that enters therein</strong></span>. Narrated by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, <strong>You should cover your mouth with your hand and not yawn in a loud voice, as Satan will laugh at you if you do so.  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

Ascertainment of what one Hears and Narrates</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And follow not (O man, i.e., say not or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge.</b></span><b>&#8221; (17:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (50:18)</b></p>

[Muslim].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 234<br />
Obligation of Jihad</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And fight against the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious).</b></span><b>&#8221; (9:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Jihad (holy fighting in Allah&#8217;s Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know</b></span><b>.&#8221; (2:216)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allah</b></span><b>&#8221; (9:41)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Jannah. They fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Qur&#8217;an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success</b></span><b>.&#8221; (9:111)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Jannah), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward. Degrees of (higher) grades from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:95, 96)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment? That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives: that will be better for you, if you but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eden) Jannah; that is indeed the great success. And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love: help from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) to the believers</b></span><b>.&#8221; (61:10-13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat relating to the subject under study are many. The Ahadith are also many; these include the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1285.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked, &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and His Messenger.</span>&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Jihad (holy fighting) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked: &#8220;What is after that (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Hajj Mabrur (which is accepted by Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1286.</b>   Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Which action is dearest to Allah?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Performing As-Salat (the prayer) at its earliest fixed time</span>.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Kindness towards parents</span>.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">To participate in Jihad in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1287.</b>  Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and Jihad (fighting, struggle) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1288.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily! Setting out in the early morning or in the evening in order to fight in Allah&#8217;s way is better than the world and what it contains</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1289.</b>   Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Who is the best among men?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A believer who strives in the way of Allah with his wealth and life</span>.&#8221; The man asked again, &#8220;Who is next to him (in excellence)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Next to him is a man who is engaged in worshipping his Rubb in a mountain valley, leaving the people secure from his mischief</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1290.</b>  Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Observing Ribat (e.g., guarding the Islamic frontier for the sake of Allah) for a single day is far better than the world and all that it contains. A place in Jannah as small as the whip of your horse is far better than the world and all that it contains. An endeavour (fighting) in the Cause of Allah in the evening or in the morning is far better than the world and all that it contains.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1291.</b>   Salman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Observing Ribat in the way of Allah for a day and a night is far better than observing Saum (fasting) for a whole month and standing in Salat (prayer) in all its nights. If a person dies (while performing this duty), he will go on receiving his reward for his meritorious deeds perpetually, and he will be saved from Al-Fattan</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>1292.</b>  Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The actions of every dead person come to a halt with his death except the one who is on the frontier in Allah&#8217;s way (i.e., observing Ribat). This latter&#8217;s deeds will be made to go on increasing for him till the Day of Resurrection, and he will be secure from the trials in the grave</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1293.</b>  `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Spending a day on the frontier in Allah&#8217;s way is better than one thousand days in any other place</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1294.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah guarantees that he who goes out to fight in His way believing in Him and affirming the truth of His Messenger, will either be admitted to Jannah or will be brought back to his home (safely) from where he has set out, with whatever reward or share of booty he may have gained. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if a person is wounded in the way of Allah, he will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wound in the same condition as it was on the day when he received it; its colour will be the colour of blood but its smell will be the smell of musk. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if it were not to be too hard upon the Muslims, I would not lag behind any expedition to fight in the Cause of Allah, but I have neither abundant means to provide them conveyance (horses) nor all other Muslims have it, and it will be hard on them to remain behind when I go forth (for Jihad). By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, I love to fight in the way of Allah and get killed, to fight again and get killed and to fight again and get killed</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1295.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">Whoever is wounded while fighting in the way of Allah, will come on the Day of Resurrection with blood oozing from his wound having the colour of blood but with the fragrance of musk</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1296.</b>   Muadh (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Jannah becomes incumbent for a Muslim who fights for the Cause of Allah for a period as long as the time between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel. He who receives a wound or a bruise in the Cause of Allah will appear on the Day of Resurrection as fresh as possible, its colour will be the colour of saffron and its fragrance will be that of musk</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1297.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions came upon a valley containing a rivulet of fresh water and was delighted by it. He reflected: `I wish to withdraw from people and settle in this valley; but I won&#8217;t do so without the permission of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8217; This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he said (to the man), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not do that, for when any of you remains in Allah&#8217;s way, it is better for him than performing Salat (prayer) in his house for seventy years. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you and admit you to Jannah? Fight in Allah&#8217;s way, for he who fights in Allah&#8217;s Cause as long as the time between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel, will be surely admitted to Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1298.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;What other good deed could be an equivalent of Jihad in the way of Allah?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You do not have the strength to do it</span>.&#8221; (The narrator said:) The question was repeated twice or thrice, but every time he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) answered, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You do not have the strength to do it</span>.&#8221; Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;One who goes out for Jihad in the Cause of Allah is like a person who observes Saum (fasting), stands in Salat (prayer) c<span style="color:#0000ff;">onstantly, recites the Ayat of the Qur&#8217;an and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and prayer until the participant of Jihad in the way of Allah returns</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 71<br />
Modesty and Courtesy towards the Believers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.&#8221;</b></span><b> (26:215)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers.&#8221;</b></span><b> (5:54)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [he is one of the Muttaqun (the pious)].&#8221;</b></span><b> (49:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him [i.e., those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious)].&#8221;</b></span><b> (53:32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And the men on Al-a`raf (the wall) will call unto the men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying: `Of what benefit to you were your great numbers (and hoards of wealth), and your arrogance (against Faith)?&#8217; Are they those, of whom you swore that Allah would never show them mercy. (Behold! It has been said to them): `Enter Jannah, no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (7:48,49)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>602.</b> `Iyad bin Himar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah has revealed to me that you should humble yourselves to one another. One should neither hold himself above another nor transgress against another.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>603.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Wealth does not diminish by giving Sadaqah (charity). Allah augments the honour of one who forgives; and one who serves another seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will exalt him in ranks.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>604.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="color:#008000;"> passed by some children and greeted them (by saying As-salamu `alaikum to them). Then he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do the same.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>605.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> A slave-girl of Al-Madinah would take hold of the hand of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and take him wherever she desired.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>606.</b> Al-Aswad bin Yazid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) was asked: &#8220;What did Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do inside his house?&#8221; She answered:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;He used to keep himself busy helping members of his family, and when it was the time for Salat (the prayer), he would get up for prayer.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>607.</b> Tamim bin Usaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while he was delivering a Khutbah and said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, a stranger (meaning himself) has come to inquire about his Deen. He is quite ignorant about his Deen</span>.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) interrupted his Khutbah and turned to me.<span style="color:#008000;"> Then a chair was brought for him and he sat on it. He started instructing me what Allah had taught him. Then he resumed his Khutbah and completed it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>608.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished eating his food, he would lick his three fingers (i.e., the forefinger, the middle finger and the thumb). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If anyone of you drops a morsel, he should remove anything harmful from it and then eat it. He should not leave it for Shaitan.</span>&#8221; He commanded us to clean out the dish saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You do not know in what portion of your food the blessing lies.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>609.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every Prophet has tended sheep.&#8221;</span> He was asked: &#8220;And did you?&#8221; He replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, I tended them for a few carats for the Makkans.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>610.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I am invited to a meal consisting of a sheep&#8217;s foot or shoulder, I would respond and I would accept as a gift a shoulder or a foot of a sheep.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>611.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had a she-camel called Al-`Adba&#8217; which would not allow any other camel to surpass her. A bedouin came riding his camel which outstripped it. The Muslims were much grieved at this. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) perceived it and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is Allah&#8217;s Way that he lowers whatever raises itself in the world.&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdu&#8217;l-Rahiman Ibn Ziyad Ibn An&#8217;um said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;While [Prophet] Musa (&#8216;alaihis-salaam) was in a gathering Iblis came wearing a hooded cape that changed in colors. When the devil came nearer he took off the cape and set it down and came to Musa saying: &#8216;Peace be upon you. Musa replied: &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; He said: &#8216;I am Iblis. &#8216; Musa responded: &#8216;No greetings from Allah to you, what brought you here?&#8217; The devil said: &#8216;I came to greet you because of your high godly status.&#8217; Musa said: &#8216;What have I seen you wearing?&#8217; Iblis replied: &#8216;I use it (the cape) to capture the hearts of the sons of Adam.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Musa asked:<strong> &#8216;What is it that if a human does will enable you to take him over?&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: &#8216;<strong>If he becomes fond of himself, and considered his (good) deeds plentiful</strong> .&#8217; I warn you from three things:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, never be alone with a woman that is not lawful to you. Because whenever someone does so, I personally accompany him and use her to seduce him.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>, never promise Allah something except that you fulfill your promise. Whenever someone promises Allah something I personally accompany him to prevent him from fulfilling his promise.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And</strong> never take an amount of money to give charity except that you make sure you give it to that charity. Whenever someone takes an amount of money to give to charity, I personally accompany him to persuade him not to give it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Iblis walked away saying: &#8216;Woe to me, thrice, I have taught [Prophet] Musa from what to warn the sons of Adam.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Paperback 592 Pages &#8211; ISBN : 9780904336051<br />
Publisher : Dar as-Sunnah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Deception (talbis)</strong> is to present falsehood in the image of the truth. And <strong>misleading (ghuroor)</strong> is a form of ignorance that causes you to believe falsehood to be the truth, and bad to be good. It is caused by the presence of doubtful matters. lblis influences people as much as possible. His influence depends on how alert, negligent, ignorant and knowledgeable they are.</p>
<p><strong>About The Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from enmity and hopelessness of the devil that his endeavour to misguide mankind from the Path of Allah will persist. This misguidance takes many shades and forms; be it from planting seeds of doubt, or giving rise to deviant ideas antithetical to the sacred teachings of Islam, and essentially becoming entangled within regressive intellectual and rhetorical discourses. The Ummah has suffered varying levels of deviation, some of which remain prevalent today, while more continue to be uncovered &#8211; and such is the impact of delusive plottings of the devil and his allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is the sixth instalment from Dar as-Sunnah of the illustrious Imam, Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Ibn Jawzi. Being a complete translation of his well-known and prized work, <span style="color:#993300;">Ibn Jawzi enumerates within it, many of the mechanisms and modus operandi used by the devil in deceiving and leading mankind away from the Straight Path. It is of particular value and importance because only by unearthing and accentuating some of the traps of the devil, can mankind avoid them as well as navigate others away from falling prey to his harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Speaking about the devil and his plotting, the author wrote that, &#8220;he was only able to do so while creeping during the night of ignorance. Had the dawn of knowledge shone on him, he would have been exposed. Thus I decided to warn from his plots for identifying evil is a form of warning from it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This translation of Tablees Iblees will provide important analysis in developing self-awareness and critical thinking to ward off many deceptions of the devil, which have plagued mankind from the time of Adam. For such reasons alone, this work is a valuable addition to the scholarly discourse it presents to the English speaking world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Author:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Jamal al-Din Abdul Rahman ibn Ali Ibn Muhammad ibn Ali Ibn Ubayd Allah Ibn al-Jawzi al-Qurashi al Tamimi al Bakri al-Baghdadi al-Hanbali (509/510-597) was the Imam of the Hanbalis and foremost orator of kings and commoners in his time, whose gatherings reportedly reached one hundred thousand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The origin of Iblis and his fate on the Day of Judgment</strong></p>
<p>Q 3: Is Iblis (Satan) a jinn or a fallen angel? If he is a jinn, what is the point of the exception made in the Qur&#8217;anic Ayah (verse) which reads: So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them: &#8230;except Iblîs (Satan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is well-known that angels belong to a category of beings whom Allah (Exalted be He) has created from light. They never disobey the commands they receive from Allah. However, Allah (Exalted be He) mentions Iblis in the Qur&#8217;an that he was from the jinn. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong>And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated themselves except Iblîs (Satan). He was one of the jinn;</strong> <strong>he disobeyed the Command of his Lord</strong>.&#8221; Justifying his refusal to prostrate himself to Adam, according to the Qur&#8217;anic text, Iblis addresses Allah (Exalted be He) saying: &#8220;<strong>You created me from fire, and him You created from clay&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for excepting Iblis from the general class of angels in the Ayah which reads: &#8220;<strong>So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them: &#8230;except Iblîs (Satan)&#8221;</strong> the Arabic word illa (i.e. Except), which ordinarily means except and is used as indicating Istithna’( exception ), is sometimes used to indicate Istithna’ Munqati` (an exception where the thing excluded is not of the same type as the thing that was mentioned before the word illa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is grammatically correct in Arabic to say:&#8221; ja’ al-qawmu illa himaran&#8221;, the meaning of which is that &#8220;all the people came except a donkey&#8221;; the people and the donkey belonging to two different classes. It is exactly in this sense that the word illa (except) is used here; the angels and Iblis belonged to two different classes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, some scholars are of the view that Iblis originally belonged to the category of angels, but incurred the eternal curse of Allah (Exalted be He) when he disobeyed His command and persisted in rebellion.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Q 2: Does the following Hadith bear evidence on the dominance of Jinn (creatures created from fire) over Humans? Abu Al-Sa&#8217;ib narrated:  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">We visited Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry in his house and while we were waiting for him (to finish his Prayer) we heard something under his bed. We looked towards the sound and found a snake. I jumped up to kill it, but he (Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry) gestured that I should sit down. I sat down and when he finished (the Prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who was newly wed. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) to take part in the Battle of the Trench, this young man used to ask for Allah&#8217;s Messenger&#8217;s (peace be upon him) permission to return to his family everyday at midday. One day, he sought permission from him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) (after granting him the permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Qurayzhah (may harm you). The man took his weapons and came back to find his wife standing between the two doors. He was hit by jealousy and made a dash towards her with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on the bed. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man . . .</span></span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">(Related by</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Muslim </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8216;Refer to Mishkah Al-Masabih,chapter on [The lawful and the prohibited to eat]&#8217;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: Firstly: </b>The Hadith is Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) in terms of its Sanad (chain of narrators) and Matn (text).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly: </b>Adam was created from clay in human form, then his offspring propagated. Jinn were created from fire then became living beings and were divided into males and females. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent to both humans and Jinn, some of them believed and some disbelieved. Humans can harm Jinn with or without knowledge and Jinn can harm humans, knock them down, or kill them just as a human may harm another human. A Jinny (a creature created from fire) may harm another Jinny. Indeed, whoever denies the power of Jinn while unaware of their condition follows that of which they have no knowledge and contradicts the guidance of the Qur&#8217;an concerning their power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Rahman, 55: 14" target="_blank" name="Hecreatedman(Adam)fromsounding"></a>He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Rahman, 55: 15" target="_blank" name="Andthejinn:Hecreatedfroma"></a>And the jinn: He created from a smokeless flame of fire.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23: 12" target="_blank" name="AndindeedWecreatedman(Adam)"></a>And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah addresses them in the same manner He addresses humans in His saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Rahman, 55: 13" target="_blank" name="ThenwhichoftheBlessingsof"></a>Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> And His saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Rahman, 55: 33" target="_blank" name="Oassemblyofjinnandmen!If"></a>O assembly of jinn and men!

Those are in manifest error.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-An`am, 6: 128" target="_blank" name="AndontheDaywhenHewillgather"></a>And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): &#8220;O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,&#8221; and their Auliyâ’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: &#8220;Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.&#8221; He will say: &#8220;The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-An`am, 6: 129" target="_blank" name="AndthusWedomaketheZ%C3%A2lim%C3%BBn"></a>And thus We do make the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) Auliyâ’ (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Read also the Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) of Surah Al-Jinn for it tells you all about their form, actions, and the recompense of those who believed and those who disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing strange about a Jinny hurting a human or inflicting harm on them just as a human may hurt a Jinny and inflict harm if the Jinny takes the form of an animal such as the one mentioned in the question and the Hadith related by<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari</span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Abu Hurayrah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="AstrongdemonofJinncameto"></a>A strong demon of Jinn came to me yesterday suddenly, so as to spoil my Salah (Prayer), but Allah enabled me to overpower him, and so I caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the Masjid (mosque) so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the invocation of my brother Solomon: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Sad, 38: 35" target="_blank" name="Hesaid:MyLord!Forgiveme,"></a>My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> so I let him go cursed. Generally, Jinn and humans are either Mu&#8217;mins (believers) or Kafirs (disbelievers), good or bad, beneficent or harmful but it is all by Allah&#8217;s Will as mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Finally: </b>The Jinn world and forms are screened from humans. It is an area where we know nothing except what is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). We should believe in the truth conveyed in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah with no doubt or denial. Similarly, we should refrain from interfering with what is unknown to us, for affirming or denying things that are unwarranted in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah is an act of ignorance which Allah (Exalted be He) forbids: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Isra', 17: 36" target="_blank" name="Andfollownot(Omani.e.,say"></a>And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allâh).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>At the time of &#8216;Umar, a man was kidnapped by the jinn and stayed with them for four years, then he came back and told the people that some mushrik jinn had kidnapped him, and he stayed with them as a prisoner, then some Muslim jinn launched a campaign against them and defeated them, and brought him back to his family.</strong></p>
<p>This was mentioned in Manaar al-Sabeel and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Manaar al-Sabeel, 2/88. The story of the kidnapped man was reported by al-Bayhaqi (7/445-446) and its Isnaad was classed as Sahih by <strong>al-Albaani</strong> in al-Irwaa&#8217;, 6/150, no.1709</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This question is from Abu-Umar, from Damascus: Sometimes, as soon as I mention a blessing Allah has bestowed on a relative or a friend, some people knock on wood. They do that as an expression of fear of the evil eye. In some instances, they demand of one to knock on wood by saying: &#8220;Knock on wood&#8221;. What is the validity of such behaviour? Please advise us. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong> by Shaykh Ibn Baz:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is reprehensible behaviour, which must not be done, and the underlying belief is corrupt. Instead, when a person gains a blessing, he has to <em><strong>thank Allah for it</strong></em>, and to <em><strong>beg Him to perfect that blessing</strong></em> and <em><strong>make him grateful</strong></em>. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;<strong>And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give thanks, I will give you more; but if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment is dire</strong>&gt;&gt;</span>. [Ibraheem Sura, Ayah No. 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. To commence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; has perused the letter submitted to his Honor, the General Mufti by the questioner through Sa`d Al-Husayn. The letter was referred to the Committee by the Secretariat-General for the Council of Senior Scholars under the number 16 on 3/1/1421 A.H. The text of the question is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">A man in Breen, governorate of Al-Zarqa&#8217;, named Muhammad Idris Al-Hawamdah, claims that he treats people through reading the Qur&#8217;an on water after diagnosing the disease. According to him, an angel standing above his eyes enables him to see the disease. We tried in vain to convince him that angels do not come down to any person after the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) with revelation. He insists on his claim adding that this is a Karamah (an extraordinary event performed by a pious person) given to him by Allah. He confirms that he has no connection with the Jinn (creatures created from fire), Muslims or non-Muslims, at all; rather, he deals only with the angels. What is the ruling on the person who claims so? He tempted many citizens of the Gulf States generally and Saudi people in particular. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p>After the Committee examined the question, it gave the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels (peace be upon them) do not do anything except by the command of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and it is beyond the capacity of man to control them however he wants. The claim that man deals with the angels or that they help him has no conclusive evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality is that evil spirits that are jinn or devils may communicate with many people believing that they are angels. They are spirits that communicate with star worshippers and other idolaters. Thus, it is not permissible for a muslim to claim that he deals with the angels, nor is it permissible for Muslims to believe him. If a man is proved to seek the help of jinn or spirits in treating the patients, it will not be permissible to visit him for treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, Anyone who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty nights will not be accepted. Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith. He (peace be upon him) also stated, If anyone resorts to a diviner or a soothsayer and believes in what he says, he will be a disbeliever in what was revealed to Muhammad. Related by Imam Ahmad and Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) through a good Sanad (chain of narrators). These  Hadith and others indicate that it is prohibited to consult or believe diviners and soothsayers who claim knowledge of the Ghayb (the Unseen) or seek the help of jinn, provided their behaviors confirm that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">The Ruling Concerning Putting a Knife On a Child in Order to Protect Him</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">I have seen some people placing a knife on their small children and saying, &#8220;This is so the jinn do not come to him.&#8221; Is this practice correct?</span></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an objectionable act and there is no sound source for it. It is not allowed to do such a thing. What is legally sanctioned is to seek refuge from them by Allah&#8217;s complete words from every devil and poisonous pest, as has been confirmed from the Prophet (peace be upon him). He used to seek protection by those words for his grandsons al-Hasan and al-Husain Ibn Ali. It is also sanctioned to make <em>dua</em> for them by asking Allah to protect them from every evil. As for putting a knife or something similar, of iron, wood or other substances, with the belief that such will protect them from the jinn, it is an evil practice that is not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similar is the ruling with respect to hanging an amulet over them, which is what is called <em>al-tama&#8217;im.</em> This is not allowed because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever hangs an amulet, Allah will not complete[his affair] for him&#8221;<sup> [1]</sup></p>
<p>In another narration, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk.&#8221;<sup> [2]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah bestow understanding of the religion upon all Muslims, and steadfastness in the religion. We seek refuge for ourselves and them<sup>3</sup> from everything that differs from His pure law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;">Why Did the Angels Teach Magic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"> Q/A With Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan [hafithahullaah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">How is it that the angels taught magic when teaching magic is a form of disbelief?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a trial and a test for the people to see who was going to believe and who was going to disbelieve. So Allaah ta3alaa sent these two angels to teach the people magic to test them and see who was going to believe and who was going to disbelieve. Accordingly, they did not teach any of the people, as Allaah, the Exalted has said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“ Except that they said: ‘ Verily we are only a trial, so do not disbelieve”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{Soorah al-Baqaarah, 2:102}</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they would advise the student to abandon the learning of magic, while clarifying that it is disbelief. They were not just teaching people and remaining quiet (about the disbelief of magic), rather they were advising them that this was disbelief .So when someone came forth by his own choice he disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah had the two angels teaching people magic as a test for them, not that magic is acceptable or that it is permissible. It was only to distinguish those who were going to disbelieve from those who were going to believe and accept the advice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: I frequently remember the sins I used to commit before I was guided, especially when I see the place where I used to commit the sin or the person with whom I committed it. This upsets me and makes me feel pain and regret. I wonder if my Tawbah (repentance to Allah) will erase my sins. I often remember my sins while I am performing Salah (Prayer).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Anyone who makes sincere Tawbah to Allah, Allah promises to accept their Tawbah. Even better still, Allah, out of His Graciousness and Generosity, turns the sins into good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah may (He be Exalted) says: Except those who repent and believe (in Islâmic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allâh will change their sins into good deeds, and Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:70)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also (Exalted be He) says: And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them, (till his death). (Surah Ta-Ha, 20:82)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Satan strives hard to seduce humans to make them fall into evil and sin. If the person escapes from the snares of Satan, and he see that they have turned to Allah,he starts to cast doubts into their heart regarding the sincerity of their Tawbah and magnify their sin in their eyes, making them think that Allah will not forgive such sins, because they are too many and too grave. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">He makes them forget that Allah states Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) to be the worst of all sins and the evilest of all misdeeds, and then He mentions the major sins, and promises to accept the Tawbah of anyone who turn to Him penitently and does righteous good deeds. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">If Satan does not find response, he starts to remind people of their past sins and misdeeds to make them feel sad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from Shaitân (Satan), in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allâh permits. And in Allâh let the believers put their trust. (Surah Al-Mujadalah, 58:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Praised) orders His believing servants to seek His Refuge from Satan and describes him as &#8220;the retreating whisperer&#8221;, because he whispers to people and then retreats and flees once a Muslim seeks refuge with Allah and seeks His Help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allâh) the Lord of mankind, &#8220;The King of mankind &#8211; &#8220;The Ilâh (God) of mankind, &#8220;From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one&#8217;s heart after one remembers Allâh). &#8220;Who whispers in the breasts of mankind. &#8220;Of jinn and men.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you have to seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from Satan and perform a lot of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and Istighfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to an authentic Hadith, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Anyone who says: ‘La ilaha illa Allahu wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul-mulku walahul-hamdu wa-huwa ‘alakulli shay&#8217;in qadir (There is no deity except Allah, Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Sovereignty and His is the Praise, and He is over all things Omnipotent),&#8217;one hundred times every day, it will be equivalent for them to freeing ten slaves, and one hundred good deeds will be recorded for them, and one hundred bad deeds will be erased from them and it will be a protection for them against Satan on that day until evening comes. No one will come with anything better than it (on the Day of Resurrection), except for one who does more than this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The jinn live upon the same earth as humans do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Most of them can be found among the <strong>ruins</strong> and <strong>dilapidated areas</strong>, as well as the places where there are many impure things, such as, <strong>bathrooms</strong>, <strong>hashish dens</strong>, <strong>garbage dumps</strong>, <strong>the places of the camels</strong>, <strong>cemeteries</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For that reason, as Ibn Taimiya said, those people who are close to Satan usually inhibit such areas. There are hadith that say that one should not pray in bathrooms due to the impurities present and because it is the abode of Satan, or in cemeteries as this leads to polytheism and it is also a home for the devils.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Many of them are in the places which may be sources of evil, such as the <strong>marketplaces</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) gave the following advice to one of his Companions,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you can, do not be the first one to enter the marketplace. And do not be the last to leave it. For they are the places of Satan and therein he raises his banner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This hadith was recorded in Sahih Muslim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devils <strong><span style="color:#000000;">live in the same houses in which people live</span></strong>. One can stop them from entering or repel them from such houses by remembering or mentioning Allah dhikr), reciting the Quran, in particular, surah al-Baqara and Ayatul Kursee (verse 255 of that surah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">devils spread out and roam about increasingly when the dark first comes</span></strong>, and, therefore, he has advised Muslims to bring in their children during that period of time. This is stated in a hadith that was recorded by both AI-Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the devils run away from the call to prayer and cannot stand listening to it. And in the month of Ramadhaan they are chained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The devils love to sit between the shade and the sunlight</span></strong>. For this reason the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the Muslims to sit in such places. This hadith was recorded in the books of Sunan and other works and it is sahih.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not only humans which are possessed, but also animals, trees and other objects. By doing this, the evil Jinn hope to make people worship others besides Allaah. The possession of idols is one way to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not so long ago the world-wide phenomenon of Hindu idols drinking milk, shocked the world. From Bombay to London, Delhi to California, countless idols were lapping up milk. Ganesh[6] the elephant god, Hanuman the monkey god and even Shiva lingam, the male private organ(!), all seemed to guzzle down the milk as if there was no tomorrow!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately people were taken in by this (including Muslims) and many flocked to feed (?) the Hindu gods. Anyone who knows about Jinn possession, will undoubtedly know that this is a classic attempt to make people commit shirk (associating partners with Allaah). And it worked, as many people started to worship these lifeless pieces of wood and marble. Anyone with half a brain would say to themselves, &#8216;why on earth does a god need to be fed?!! Surely if Ganesh, Hanuman or Shiva were divine then they wouldn&#8217;t need feeding?&#8217; However, such common sense seemed to be lacking as the Jinns played havoc with these gullible people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[6] Ganesh, the elephant headed deity, seemed to be the biggest drinker! In fact it didn&#8217;t just stop at milk. At the time of these occurrences, a woman in India decided to see if Ganesh would drink anything else &#8211; so she offered him whiskey!! And Lo and behold Ganesh drank the Whiskey!!! Suffice to say, the woman was kicked out of India.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on invoking the Jinn (creatures created from fire) against a certain person to harm them, like saying, &#8220;Take so-and-so&#8221; or &#8220;Harm them&#8221;? What is the ruling on someone who does that? I heard someone say that whoever seeks the help of the Jinn, their Salah (Prayer) and Sawm (Fast) will not be accepted. In addition, when they die, funeral prayer should not be offered for them, their funeral should not be followed and they should not be buried in the Muslim graveyards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking the help of the Jinn and turning to them to fulfill needs, such as asking them to harm or benefit a person, is an act of Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a kind of mutual benefiting between Jinn and mankind; the Jinn fulfill the human&#8217;s needs and in return they get the human’s veneration, trust, and reliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says, And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): &#8220;O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,&#8221; and their Auliyâ’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: &#8220;Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.&#8221; He will say: &#8220;The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.&#8221; And thus We do make the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) Auliyâ’ (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says, ‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression. Therefore, seeking the help of the Jinn to harm others or asking for their protection against another&#8217;s evil are all acts of Shirk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever does so, their Salah and Sawm will be nullified</span>; for Allah (Exalted be He) says, &#8220;If you join others in worship with Allâh, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who is known for doing so, <span style="color:#ff6600;">funeral prayer should not be offered for them, their funeral should not be followed and they should not be buried in the Muslim graveyards</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on hypnosis through which the hypnotist possess power over the hypnotized and have the ability to dominate them and make them abandon a forbidden act, cure them from a psychological disturbance, or make them carry out theirs (the hypnotist) orders?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Hypnosis is a type of soothsaying, in which a hypnotist seeks the help of a Jinn and makes him overpower a hypnotized person and talk through him.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jinn gives the hypnotized person power to do certain actions, if he agrees to obey the hypnotist and is truthful with him in return for mutual benefits. Accordingly, the Jinn causes the hypnotized person to obey the hypnotist in any actions or to give any information asked from him, if it is being honest with the hypnotist. It is therefore not permissible to utilize hypnosis or to use it to find a stolen or lost object, to cure a sick person, or to do anything through a hypnotized person. In fact, this is Shirk, due to what was previously mentioned and because it is resorting to other than Allah in matters that are beyond those ordinarily permitted by Allah for His Creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam drew a line for us and said. &#8220;This is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path.&#8221; Then he drew lines to its right and left and then said. &#8220;These ore other paths. <strong>Upon every one of them there is a devil calling towards it</strong>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then he recited: &#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221; [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153].&#8221; [1]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[1] Hasan: Related by Ahmad (1/435) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (7/49), from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood radiallaahu &#8216;anhu. It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in Dhilaalul-Jannah fee Takhreejis-Sunnah (no.16).</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Following is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir of the verse : Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> recorded that, An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">(Allah has given a parable of the straight path, and on the two sides of this path, there are two walls containing door ways. On these door ways, there are curtains that are lowered down. on the gate of this path there is a caller heralding, `O people! come and enter the straight path all together and do not divide. &#8216; There is also another caller that heralds from above the path, who says when a person wants to remove the curtain on any of these doors, `Woe to you! Do not open this door, for if you open it, you will enter it. The (straight) path is Islam, the two walls are Allah&#8217;s set limits, the open doors lead to Allah&#8217;s prohibitions, the caller on the gate of the path is Allah&#8217;s Book (the Qur&#8217;an), while the caller from above the path is Allah&#8217;s admonition in the heart of every Muslim.)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Gharib.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Precious Gem: The Satanic Ways of Tempting</p>
<p>Satan has three ways of tempting man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>One</strong>: Increase and extravagance; to have more than one needs. This addition is the way, which Satan uses to enter the heart. To protect oneself from that is to be careful not to fulfill all the needs of the soul like food, sleep, pleasure, or rest. Whenever you close this door, you would be safe from any enemy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Two</strong>: Negligence; whoever remembers Allah is protected by the fortress of remembering Him. When he neglects that he will be  opening the door of this fortress and the enemy will enter. It would then be difficult to drive him out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Three</strong>: Caring for what is not his business in all matters of life.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Those involved in incantations and oaths often swear by some devils to help them against others. Sometimes the evil JINN fulfill their request but frequently they do not, especially when the JINN against whom help is sought is honored among them. Neither the one chanting incantations nor his incantations have any power to force the devils to help them. The reciter of incantations earnestly entreats a being whom he considered great &#8211; which may or may not be the case &#8211; to harm others who may conceivably be greater. In the case where someone entreats the JINN to harm someone whom the JINN hold in high esteem, they will ignore him. In fact, it may prevent them from even responding at all. Their situations is quite similar to that of humans except that human beings are generally more intelligent, truthful, just and trustworthy while the JINN tend to be ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah mentioned the following  historical incident concerning al-Hallaaj and a group of his followers,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;Some of them requested some sweets from al-Hallaaj, so he got up and went to a spot a short distance away, then returned with a plateful of sweets. It was later discovered that it had been stolen from a candy shop in Yemen and carried by a devil to that area.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah went on to say, <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong><span id="more-41317"></span></strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;Incidents similar to this have happened to others who, like al-Hallaaj, also achieved the pinnacle of satanic states, and we know of quite a few such people in our time as well as other times. For instance, there is a person presently residing in Damascus whom the devil used to carry from the Saaliheeyah mountain to villages around Damascus. He would appear out of the air and enter the windows of houses in which people were gathered to witness his &#8216;miraculous entrance.'&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah also quoted another mystic master who admitted that he used to fornicate with women and sodomise young boys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The former mystic master said, &#8220;A black dog with two white spots between his eyes would come to me and say, &#8216;Verily such and such a person has made an oath by you and he will come to you tomorrow to inform you about it. I have already fulfilled his need for your sake.&#8217; The person would then come to him the next day and the Sufi master would reveal the details of his oath to him and how it was fulfilled. The Sufi master went on to say, &#8216;I used to walk about the city and a black pole with a light on top of it would lead the way.&#8217; &#8221; Ibn Taymeeyah said, &#8220;When the Sufi master repented and began to pray, fast, and avoid the forbidden, the black dog went away.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also narrated the following about another mystic master who had the aid of devils whom he would despatch to possess people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;When the family of the possessed would come to him seeking a cure, he would send a message to his demon companion and they would leave the possessed persons, as a result, the Shaykh would be given many dirhams for his services. Sometimes the Jinn would bring him dirhams and food which they stole from people, so much so that the Shaykh would request dates from his devils and they would take them from beehives in which some poeple had hidden their dates. When the beehive owners would look for their dates they would find them gone.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About yet another mystic, Ibn Taymeeyah relates,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;There was a Shaykh knowledgeable in the religious sciences and Qur&#8217;anic recitation to whom the devils came and eventually managed to seduce. They told him that Salaah was no longer required of him and that they would bring him whatever he wished. As soon as he complied with their wishes, they began to bring him a variety of sweets and fruit. This continued until he was advised to repent by some scholars that he visited who were firmly following the Sunnah. He subsequently repented and repaid the owners of the sweets for what he ate while under the influence of the JINN.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then went on to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;Many of those who call on Shaykhs in time of need saying, &#8216;O master so and so, or Shaykh so and so, fulfill my need&#8217; have seen an image of the Shaykh saying, &#8216;I will fulfill your need and put your heart at ease,&#8217; then it fulfills their needs or repels their enemies. In such cases it is a devil taking the Shaykh&#8217;s form when they committed Shirk by associating partners with Allaah and calling on others beside Him.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah then went on to enumerate similar instances involving himself saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;I know of many such incidences even among a group of my companions who called on me in times when they were struck by calamities. One was afraid of the Romans and another of the Tatars. Both of them mentioned that they called out to me, they saw me in the air and I repelled their enemies for them. I informed them that I did not hear their cries nor did I repel their enemies. It was a devil taking my appearance to seduce them when they associated partners with Allaah the Almighty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Similar incidents have also happened to the students of my contemporaries among the scholars, whereby some of their students have sought refuge in them and have seen them fulfill their needs. The scholars have also denied doing so and indicated that it was in fact the work of devils.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another book, Ibn Taymeeyah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;I know people whom the plants greet and inform them of their beneficial ingredients, however it is, in fact, Satan who has entered the plants and spoken to them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">I also know of others to whom stones and trees speak saying, &#8220;Congratulations, Oh friend of Allaah&#8221; and when the people recite Aayatul-Kursee it stops. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">I am acquainted with yet others who have gone bird-hunting and the sparrows addressed them saying, &#8220;Take me so that the poor may eat me.&#8221; Such are cases of the evil JINN possessing the birds. in the same way that others who, while in their house with the doors and vice versa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">He may even be taken through the closed city gates and back again swiftly by the JINN. Lights may shine on him or someone looking like his friend may call on him but, if he recites Aayatul-Kursee continually, it will all dissappear.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">&#8220;Some mystics have also said that the JINN showed them something shiny like water and glass in which images or pictures of whatever they sought information would appear and they in turn wold inform people.&#8221; </span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">A reply sent to Shaykh `Aly Tantawy on 12/11/1408 A.H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah. May peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some short and long articles were published in local newspapers and others in the month of Sha`ban of this year (1407 A.H.) regarding the declaration of some members of the Jinn who possessed Muslim women in Riyadh. They declared that they had become Muslims before me after they had declared this before brother `Abdullah ibn Mushrif Al-`Umary who lives in Riyadh. Al-`Umary recited some Adhkar (invocations) on the Jinn-possessed lady and talked to the Jinn, reminding him of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Omnipotence as well as frightening him with the grievous sin of injustice. After the Jinn said that he is a Buddhist disbeliever, the shaykh called him to Islam and to come out of the woman whom he was possessing. Accordingly, the Jinn complied and declared his conversion to Islam before shaykh Al-`Umary. Then, shaykh Al-`Umary and the guardians of the woman wanted to come to me with the woman to hear the Jinn member&#8217;s conversion to Islam. When they were all present, I asked the Jinn about the reason for embracing Islam. He spoke on the tongue of the woman but in a manly voice. All this happened in the presence of the woman who was sitting in the chair next to me beside her brother, sister and shaykh Al-`Umary as well as some shayks who witnessed and heard the speech of the Jinn while openly declaring his conversion to Islam. He said he was a Buddhist from India. On my part, I advised him to observe Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared) and to leave the body of this woman as he is making her suffer. The Jinn submitted to my order and said that he embraced Islam willingly. Therefore, I advised him to call his people to Islam after Allah (Exalted be He) had guided him to the right path. He came out of the woman&#8217;s body and his last word was &#8220;As-salamu `alaykum&#8221; (peace be upon you), then the woman spoke with her normal voice and felt comfortable and relaxed from the pain he was causing to her. After the lapse of a month or more, she visited me again with her brothers, maternal uncle, and sister and told me that she was very well, her condition was stable and the Jinn had never returned to her. When I asked her about how she felt when she was possessed by this Jinn, she said that she always had deviant ideas contradicting the Shari`ah, in addition to an inclination to the Buddhist religion, and a desire to read its books. However, after this Jinn was exercised from her, she no longer had such ideas, as she returned to her normal state away from such abominable ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span id="more-408"></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was told that shaykh `Aly Al-Tantawy denied the occurrence of such matters, claiming that this is a kind of charlatanism and mere lies. He said that the speech that was mentioned on the tongue of the woman might have been recorded, not real. I asked for the tape in which the Jinn had declared that, and was confirmed that such opinions are really his. However, I could not imagine how he could think that what the woman said was recorded even though I, myself, asked the Jinn some questions and he replied. Then how could a person having the least degree of wisdom imagine that a recorded tape can be asked and give answers. This is one of the ugliest abominations and a way of permitting falsehood. He even said that the Jinn&#8217;s conversion to Islam by a human opposes Allah&#8217;s Saying in the story of Sulayman (Solomon) as He says: and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me Undoubtedly, his understanding was wrongful and untrue (may Allah guide him) as there is nothing whatsoever regarding the Jinn&#8217;s conversion to Islam by a human going against Sulayman&#8217;s call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a multitude of the members of the Jinn converted to Islam as a result of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) Da`wah (calling to Islam) to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is mentioned in the Surah of Al-Ahkaf and Surah of Al-Jinn. It is reported in the Two Sahih Books on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Satan came to me yesterday suddenly, so as to spoil my prayer but Allah enabled me to overpower him, and so I caught him  and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the invocation of my brother Sulayman (Solomon) (peace be upon him): My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me so I let him go cursed. This is the wording of Al-Bukhari, whereas the wording of Muslim is: A strong demon of the Jinn came to me yesterday suddenly, so as to spoil my prayer, but Allah enabled me to overpower him, and I caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the invocation of my brother Sulayman (Solomon) (peace be upon him): My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me so I let him go cursed</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by <strong>Al-Nasa&#8217;iy</strong> in conformity with the authenticity condition of Al-Bukhari on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Prophet (peace be upon him) was performing prayer, Satan came to him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) took him and strangled him, and said: &#8220;I did so till I felt the coldness of his tongue on my hand and had not been for the invocation of my brother Sulayman, he would have been bound until people would see him.&#8221; Related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud on the authority of Abu Sa`id with the wording: I kept strangling him with my hand until I felt his saliva between my two fingers: the thumb and the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih as Mu`allaq (a Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet) (vol.4, p.487) as in Fath Al-Bary on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) deputed me to keep Zakat-ul-Fitr (obligatory charity paid before the Festival of Breaking the Fast) of Ramadan. Someone came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff of Zakat-ul-Fitr (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am needy and have many dependents, and I am in great need.&#8221; I released him, and in the morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) asked me, O Abu Hurayrah, &#8220;What did your prisoner do yesterday?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the person complained of being needy and of having many dependents, so, I felt pity for him and let him go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Indeed, he told you lie and he will come again.&#8221; I believed that he would come again as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) had told me that he would return. So, I waited for him watchfully. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, &#8220;I will definitely take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him). He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I promise I will not come back again.&#8221; I pitied him and let him go. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) asked me, &#8220;What did your prisoner do, Abu Hurayrah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he complained of great need and of so many dependents, so I felt pity for him and set him free.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Verily, he told you a lie and he will return.&#8221; I waited for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, &#8220;I will surely take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) as it is the third time you promise not to return, yet you break your promise and come.&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Forgive me and I will teach you some words with which Allah will benefit you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What are they?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah). Allâh! Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). By doing so, Allah will appoint a guard for you and no devil will come near you until the morning.&#8221; So I let him go. When it was morning, the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked me, &#8220;What did your prisoner do?&#8221; I replied: &#8220;He claimed he will teach me some words with which Allah will benefit me.&#8221; So the Messenger asked, &#8220;What are they?&#8221; Abu Hurayarah replied, &#8220;He said: whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah). Allâh! Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). By doing so, Allah will appoint a guard for you and no devil will come near you until the morning.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;He told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been talking to for three nights, Abu Hurayrah? He replied in the negative and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;It was Satan.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Satan circulates in the human body as blood does.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related by <strong>Al-Imam Ahmad</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) in his Musnad vol. 4, p. 216 with a Sahih Sanad (chain of narrators) that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uthman ibn Abu Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, the devil confounds my prayer.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;That is a devil called Khanzab. When you feel his illusory acts, spit three times at your left and seek refuge with Allah from the devil three times.&#8221; `Uthman said: &#8220;When I did that, Allah dispelled from me what I felt.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported in Sahih Hadiths that every human has a companion from the Jinn and another from the Angels, even the Prophet (peace be upon him) but Allah (Exalted be He) helped him against his companion until this companion converted to Islam. The Book of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet, and Ijma` (consensus) of the Ummah (nation) all mentioned the possibility of a Jinn possessing a human and causing him to be epileptic, then how could unqualified person, who is not a scholar, deny that without knowledge and guidance? This denial is the way of innovators who contradict the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). It is Allah Alone Whose help can be sought. There is neither might nor power except with Allah! I will mention for you, the reader, some accounts of scholars in this regard in-sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Commentaries of Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an)</strong> (may Allah be merciful with them) regarding Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Ja`far ibn Jarir</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) commented on this Ayah: Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. saying, &#8220;Allah means that Satan allures the one who consumes Riba (usury) to insanity during his lifetime, as Satan causes him depression and seizure because of Al-Mass (insanity).&#8221; Al-Baghawy (may Allah be merciful with him) commented on this Ayah (verse): will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. meaning, the possessed refers to the person who is in state of insanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Kathir</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) said regarding the Ayah: Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. &#8220;The people referred to in the Ayah will be resurrected from their graves on the Day of Resurrection in a similar condition to someone who is possessed by Satan i.e. in a condemned way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn `Abbas</strong> (may Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;The usurer is resurrected on the Day of Resurrection as a choking insane person.&#8221; Related by Ibn Abu Hatim. The same effect was also narrated on the authority of `Awf ibn Malik Sa`id ibn Jubayr, Al-Suddy, Al-Rabi` ibn Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil ibn Hayyan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is ibn Kathir&#8217;s account, may Allah be merciful with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Qurtuby</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) comments on Allah&#8217;s saying: Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">saying this verse is a proof against those who deny the possession of Jinn in human beings and think that it is a natural disposition and that Satan can never enter or be a part of a human. Many Mufassirs gave accounts to this effect. For more information, please check Tafsir books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) said in his book Idah-ul-Dilalh Fi `Umum Al-Risalah Lil Thaqalayn (Explaining the Significance of Generality of the Message to Both Humans and Jinn) in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (The Compendium of Fatwas) vol.19, pp.9-65, &#8220;For this reason some Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) figureheads, including Al-Gubba&#8217;i and Abu Bakr Al-Razy and others denied the entrance of the Jinn into the body of the epileptic. However, they did not deny the existence of the Jinn, even though the entrance of the Jinn into human has not been reported, according to them, in the Prophet&#8217;s Traditions (peace be upon him). Definitely, they went wrong in this regard. That is why Al-Ash`ary mentioned in his book, Maqalat Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, that they proclaimed that the Jinn enter the body of the epileptic person, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said, &#8220;I told my father that some people claim that Jinn can never enter the body of a person. So he said, &#8216;O son! They tell lies. Satan can even speak on the tongue of those whom he possesses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) also said in (vol.24, pp 276-277) the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The existence of Jinn is affirmed in the Book of Allah, Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and according to the consensus of the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors) of this Ummah and its leading scholars. The entrance of a Jinn into a human body is also confirmed by the consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). Allah (the Exalted states) says: Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Satan circulates in the human body as blood does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Abdullah ibn Al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I told my father that some people claim that Jinn can never enter the body of a person. So he said, &#8216;O son! They tell lies. Satan can even speak on the tongue of those whom he possesses.&#8221; Shaykh-ul-Islam said, &#8220;What he [Imam Ahmad] said is self-evident. The Jinn may possess someone and cause them to speak a language they do not even know. A possessed person may be violently beaten, in a way that even a camel may not endure, yet he neither feels the beating nor is aware of the words he says.&#8221; Furthermore, the possessed person may pull the drag he is sitting upon, moves things from a place to another, and other practices that confirmed to those who witnessed such behavior that the one who spoke or moved was not a human being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, &#8220;None of the leading Muslim scholars ever denied the ability of Jinn to enter the body of a human being. Whoever denies this fact and assumes that Shari`ah denies it has fabricated lies against Shari`ah, as there is no Shari`ah-based evidence that denies this fact.&#8221; (End of quote).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) mentioned the following in his book, Zad Al-Ma‘ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-‘Ibad, vol. 4, pp. 66-69:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are two types of Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Possession caused by earthly malicious spirits;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the other caused by filthy mixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second type, it is the domain of physicians to find what causes it and how to treat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the possession of spirits, the knowledgeable persons among them acknowledge its existence and do not deny it. They also admit that its treatment should be by confronting the celestial, benevolent and honorable spirits with that wicked and malicious ones to ward off the evil they cause and forestall their acts. This is even stated by Hippocrates in some of his books, as he mentioned some cures for possession. However, he said that his cure is only beneficial in case of possession caused by mixture of filthy blends, but not for that caused by evil spirits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ignorant, worthless and disreputable physicians deny the possession of spirits and do not admit that the affect the body of the possessed relying on no evidence to support their claims. They are only ignorant as there is no medical proof to prove the impermissibility of this matter even though the Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings is an established fact and reality attests to it. However, the physicians&#8217; denial of possession and ascribing this to the occurrence of some filthy blends is partially, not completely true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ignorant and atheist doctors started to attribute the possession of human beings as caused only by filthy blends, but anyone with the least knowledge of such spirits and how they affect the body of the possessed will be astonished at the ignorance of such people and the weakness of their perception of such matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It should be noted that providing a treatment for possession is done on both sides; the person who is possessed and the healer.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the duty of the possessed person,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">he should have strong Iman and sincerely turn to the One who created such spirits and be attentive with his tongue and heart when seeking refuge with Allah (Exalted be He), as if he is in a battlefield in which two matters are indispensable for him to gain victory over his enemy; the right weapon and the strong hand that holds it. If any of them falls short, the other is useless, let alone the lack of both things and the obscenity of a believing heart deprived of Tawhid, Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah), Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared) and sincerely seeking Allah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second aspect related to the healer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">who should not lack the same two matters, as some healers only find it sufficient to say to the Jinn, &#8220;come out of the body&#8221;, or &#8220;Bismillah [In the Name of Allah], or say, &#8220;There is neither might nor power except with Allah!. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say, Get out, you are the enemy of Allah and I am the Messenger of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I witnessed our shaykh sending a person to speak with the possessing spirit in the body, saying, &#8220;The shaykh commands you to get out, this is not permissible for you&#8221;, and then the possessed person comes to his senses and may even speak with the Jinn. In other cases, the Jinn might be of rebellious and obstinate in which case they need to be exorcised through beating the body of the person who wakes up feeling no pain at all. We often witnessed that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added, &#8220;Generally speaking, this kind of possession and treatment is not denied except from some weak-minded people whose knowledge is unreliable. In most cases, those who are possessed by such evil spirits are responsible for their condition by their poor share of practicing sound Iman (Faith), and the depravity of their tongues and hearts from authentic Adhkar and Prophetic supplications. This condition provides the evil spirit, which finds a person stripped of Iman to protect him or her, and affect and dominate his body.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of his account &#8211; may Allah be merciful with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through the Shari`ah-based evidence that we have mentioned and the consensus of the scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) concerning the possibility of Jinn haunting a human body, it becomes clear for readers that those who deny this fact are totally wrong, and that Shaykh `Aly Al-Tantawy made a great mistake in denying matters that he does not know very well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he promised that he would return to Al-Haqq (the Truth) whenever he is guided to. We ask Allah that he does so after reading what we mentioned. May Allah grant him and us guidance!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, it should be known that what Al-Nadwa newspaper published in its issue dated 14/10/1407 A.H., p.8 concerning what Dr. Muhammad `Irfan said about the vanishing of the word &#8220;insanity&#8221; from the medical dictionary and his describing the Jinn possessing of the human body and speaking on his tongue as completely wrong from the scientific point of view, all this is invalid on his part due to his lack of sound religious knowledge and ignorance of what the esteemed scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah have said in this regard. The ignorance of many doctors with regard to this fact is not to be taken as evidence; rather it denotes their unawareness of what many other trustful scholars say that is consistent with the Shari`ah and consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, as reported by Shaykh-ul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah from all people of knowledge, and as also reported by Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash`ary from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. This was also reported to have been said by Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash`ary as cited by the versatile scholar Abu `Abdullah Muhammad Ibn `Abdullah Al-Shibly Al-Hanafy who died 799 A.H. in Chapter Fifty-One of his book, &#8220;Akam Al-Murjan fi Ghara&#8217;ib Al-Akhbar wa Ahkam Al-Jan&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been previously mentioned in the speech of Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful with him) that prominent physicians admit the existence of this matter and do not deny it; rather, it was denied by the ignorant and atheist among them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As such, the reader should know and comprehend fully what we said as being akin to the truth and not to fall victim to the illusory words of doctors and those following their way, or those who ignorantly speak of matters in which they do not have sound or reliable knowledge, but are just imitating ignorant physicians and some innovators from Mu`tazilah and the like. Allah is the One Whose Help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Warning</strong></span> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> The Sahih Hadiths, which we cited, are narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) as well as the reliable accounts of the people of religious knowledge that speaking to, preaching, and calling the Jinn to Islam and their acceptance do not categorically go against what Allah says in the story of Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him) inSurah Sad: &#8220;My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me: Verily, You are the Bestower.&#8221; Likewise, there is no contradiction in this regard relating to commanding the Jinn to enjoin the good and to forbid the evil or even beating them if they refuse to get out of the person possessed. All who do not oppose the mentioned Ayah; rather, this is obligatory when it comes to resisting the oppression of the wrong-doers, supporting the oppressed, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, as done with humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is previously mentioned in the Sahih Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;I seized one of the Jinn until his saliva ran onto my hand.&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Had it not been for the supplication of my brother Sulayman, he (the Jinn) would have been kept tied up so that people might watch him.&#8221; In another narration by Muslim on the authority of Abu Al-Darda&#8217; that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Allah&#8217;s enemy, Satan, came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times: &#8220;I seek refuge in Allah from you.&#8221; Then I said three times: &#8220;I curse you with Allah&#8217;s full curse.&#8221; But he did not retreat (on any one of these) three occasions. Thereafter, I attempted to seize him. I swear by Allah that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Sulayman (peace be upon him), he would have been bound and made an object of sport for the children of Madinah. There are many Hadiths narrated in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the accounts of the people of knowledge. I hope this would suffice for those who seek the truth. I ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to grant us and all Muslims sound understanding of His Din (religion), to hold fast to it, and to guide us to say the truth and to do good deeds. I also seek refuge in Allah (Exalted be He) from speaking about Him without knowledge or denying that which our limited knowledge can not comprehend. He is the One Who is Capable of doing so. May Allah grant us success! May Peace and blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions, and those who followed him in righteousness!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 12: <span style="color:#ff6600;">I see in a dream that i have a car accident or that one of my relatives is killed (may Allah forbid). i usually have this dream after Fajr (dawn) prayer. Please give me some insight regarding this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This dream is from Satan and you have to spit three times to your left and seek refuge in Allah from Satan and what you have seen once you wake up. You should then turn on your other side and this dream will not harm you. You should not tell anyone about it, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, &#8220;A good dream is from Allah and a bad dream is from Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Anyone who sees something (in a dream) that they hate, should spit to their left three times and seek refuge with Allah three times from the evil of Satan and of what they have seen. Then they should turn on the other side and it will not harm them. They should tell no one about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Differing from Satan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Satan appears in the form of a sincere advisor and claims that he is giving sincere advice to humans. It is incumbent upon the person to do the opposite of what he orders and to say to him, &#8220;If you were to advise anyone, you should advise yourself. You have put yourself in the Hell-fire. And you have earned the wrath of Allah. How can anyone advise another when he does not advise himself?&#8221; Al-Haarith ibn Qais said, &#8220;If Satan comes to you while you are praying, and says, &#8220;You are showing off,&#8221; then rebuke him and make it even longer!&#8221;&#8221; This was his insight, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are aware that there is some act that is pleasing to Satan or is one of his characteristics, then we must act in a contrary manner. For example, if Satan eats with his left hand, then we must eat with our right hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,  &#8220;Each of you should eat with his right drink with his right, take with his right and give with his right for Satan eats with his left, drinks with his left, gives with his left and takes with his left&#8221;. Also Satan drinks with us if we drink standing; therefore the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us that we should drink sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Prophet (peace be upon him) told us that we should take a short nap at midday because Satan does not do so. He said, &#8220;Take a short nap because Satan does not take a short nap&#8221;</p>

<div><strong>Question</strong>:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">According to the Sunnah, is the time for the qayloolah (siesta) before or after the Zhuhr prayer?</span></div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">It is before they pray the Zhuhr prayer. (Then), after the (mid-day) heat has lessened, they can pray (the Zhuhr prayer). And the meaning of his (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) saying:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee&#8217;s statement about jinn possessing humans</p>
<p>Praises be to Allah, Lord of `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>
<p>To answer the inquiry of Hammad ibn `Abdullah Al-Hammad, a tax notary public, about what was written by: Muhammad ibn `Abdullah Al-Fawzan in Al-Jazirah Newspaper, issue no. 10168 dating 29/4/1421A.H. denying the fact that humans can be possessed by the Jinn, the Permanent Committee of Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is evidence from the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), as well as the consensus of Ummah (nation) on the possibility and occurrence of this condition, i.e. A Jinn possessing the body of a human. Allah, the Exalted, states, Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him, said: He (Allah) means that Satan leads him to insanity during his lifetime as Satan causes him depression and seizure, (Al-Mas) means insanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Baghawy</strong>, may Allah have mercy on him, commented on this Ayah (verse), will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. with a similar statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Kathir</strong>, may Allah have mercy on him, said, &#8220;The people referred to in the Ayah will be resurrected from their graves on the Day of Resurrection in a very similar condition to someone who is possessed by Satan, in terms of the very odd state they will be in.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them, said, &#8220;The usurer is resurrected on the Day of Resurrection as a choking insane person&#8221;, narrated by Ibn Abu Hatim. He said it was narrated from `Awf ibn Malik, Sa`id ibn Jubayr, Al-Suddy, Al-Rabi` ibn Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil ibn Hayyan with close wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Qurtuby</strong>, may Allah have mercy on him, said: This Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) is a proof against those who denied the possession of Jinn in human beings thinking that it is a natural disposition and that Satan can never enter a human or be a part of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, may Allah have mercy on him, wrote in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (The Compendium of Fatwas) vol. 24, pp. 276-277,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The existence of Jinn is affirmed in the Book of Allah, Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and according to the consensus of the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors) of this Ummah and its leading scholars. Moreover, the entrance of a jinn into a human body is also confirmed by the consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). Allah, the Exalted states, Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity. In the Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith compiled by Al-Bukhari and/ or Muslim) it is reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, Satan circulates in the human body as blood does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdullah son ofImam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said, &#8220;I told my father that some people claim that Jinn can never enter the body of a person. So he said, &#8216;O son! They tell lies. Satan can even speak on the tongue of those whom he possesses.'&#8221;</span> Shaykh-ul-Islam said, &#8220;What he [`Abdullah] said is self-evident. The Jinn may possess someone and cause him to speak a language that he does not even know. A possessed person may be violently beaten, beatings that even a camel may not endure, yet he neither feels the beating nor is aware of the words he says.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;None of the leading Muslim scholars ever denied the ability of Jinn entering the body of a human being. Whoever denies this fact and assumes that the Shari`ah (Islamic law) denies it too, is fabricating lies against Shari`ah as there is no Shari`ah-based evidence that denies this fact.&#8221; (End of quote).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through the Shari`ah-based evidence that we have mentioned and the consensus of the scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) concerning the possibility of Jinn entering a human body, it becomes clear for the readers that those who denied this fact are totally wrong. Consequently, the writer Muhammad ibn `Abdullah Al-Fawzan should return to the right and not speak about matters he does not know very well. Allah, the Exalted, states, And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Attributing things to Allah with no basis of reliable knowledge is more grievous than Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as far as prohibition is concerned. Allah, the Exalted, states, Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawâhish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allâh for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allâh of which you have no knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The following text was mentioned in “Mukhtasar Sirat Al-Rasul” (The Abridged Biography of the Prophet): “The Prophet (peace be upon him) recited Surah Al-Najm in their presence, and when he reached Allah’s Saying (which means), Have you then considered Al-Lât, and Al-‘Uzzâ (two idols of the pagan Arabs) And Manât (another idol of the pagan Arabs), the other third? (Surah Al-Najm, 53: 19-20), Satan threw into his recitation the words: ‘These are the exalted Gharaniq (Cranes), whose intercession is hoped for.’ They (the disbelievers) thought that the Prophet (peace be upon him) really said it, and they rejoiced greatly.” Is this tale true? If yes, does Satan have the power to cast into his recitation the aforesaid words? Please advise, and many thanks to you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The tale of Gharaniq was mentioned by many scholars of Tafsir (explanation of the meanings of the Qur’an) in their interpretation of Allah’s Saying (the meanings of which are translated as), Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you but when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaitân (Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it. (Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 52), and in the Tafsir of Allah’s Saying, Have you then considered Al-Lât, and Al-‘Uzzâ (two idols of the pagan Arabs) And Manât (another idol of the pagan Arabs), the other third? It was narrated through many chains of narration with different wordings.However, all of them are Mursal (with no Companion of the Prophet in the chain of narration), and were never reported through authentic chains of narration, as mentioned by Al-Hafizh ibn Kathir (may Allah be merciful to him) in his Tafsir. After he mentioned this tale through all its chains of narration, he said, “However, all of them are Mursal and disconnected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Khuzaymah said that this tale was fabricated by the Zanadiqah (Heretics); it was also denied by Abu Bakr ibn Al-‘Araby, Al-Qadi ‘Iyad and others, who disapproved of both its Sanad (chain of narrators) and Matn (the text). As for the Sanad, it is due to the above-mentioned reasons. As for the Matn, it is due to what was stated by Ibn Al-‘Araby that when Allah (Exalted be He) sends the Angel to His Messenger, He instills in him (His Messenger) the knowledge that it is the Angel who sends down Wahy (Revelation) to him; Satan can never put on his lips words, which throw him into confusion, and so he recites them as Qur’an. As there is Ijma‘ (unanimous consensus) on the infallibility of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the impossibility of his committing Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), he could not have said these words by mistake, or thinking that they were Qur’an. He could not have preferred pleasing his people over pleasing his Lord, which made him wish that Allah would not reveal anything to him that might displease them. Moreover, the evidence used to prove the authenticity of this tale, which is inferred from Allah’s saying, Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed (the Qur’ân) unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), to fabricate something other than it against Us (Surah Al-Isra’, 17: 73) certainly does not prove its authenticity. Rather, it proves the innocence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) of the accusation of reciting these polytheistic words, as the Ayah indicates denial and negation, not affirmation.It is also evident that Satan merely threw some falsehood into his recitation, but he did put such polytheistic words on his tongue nor inspired these words inside him, which he actually recited, read, or uttered, whether inattentively, by mistake or on purpose, until Jibril (Gabriel) came and corrected him, and he (peace be upon him) grieved over what happened. It was not also proven that the Ayah was revealed to console the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) for what he was afflicted with according to this tale, to prop up such an interpretation with all the errors that it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Jumhur (dominant majority) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah)</strong> agreed with Ibn Al-‘Araby on what he said. They stated that the meaning of the Ayah is: Never did Allah send a Messenger or a Prophet before you (O Muhammad) but when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke, a devil from among mankind or jinn would throw during his recitation or speech some false words spoken by that devil and heard by the attendants. Or the devil would whisper evil thoughts to the Kafirs (disbelievers) and hypocrites who thought them to be part of the Wahy, while they are not so. Allah then abolishes whatever words, whisperings or deception which Satan throws in and completely eliminates them, to establish the truth by His Words, for the Perfection of His Knowledge and Profound Wisdom. This is the Way of Allah with His Messengers, Prophets and their enemies, to fulfill the purpose of trying and testing mankind, so that the wicked is distinguished from the good; so that the Kafirs and hypocrites who are to be destroyed through their following the falsehood that Satan casts may be destroyed after a clear evidence, and the people of unwavering faith, whose hearts rest secure in Iman (belief), who are guided to the Straight Path, may live after clear evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it becomes clear through the previously mentioned that the tale of Gharaniq is false. Satan does not have the power to thrust some falsehood into the mouth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) which he then recites or utters. Satan might have thrown some false words while the Prophet (peace be upon him) was reciting; words which were uttered by Satan and heard by the attendants, or Satan might have whispered some evil inspirations in the soul of the disbelievers and hypocrites, which they thought them to be part of the Wahy, while they are not. Allah then abolishes such Satanic sayings, eliminates misconception and establishes His revelations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also becomes clear that the opinion of <strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) is the same of the Jumhur (dominant majority) of scholars, which holds that Satan has thrown some falsehood or evil whispering during recitation, but certainly not on the tongue of the Prophet (peace be upon him), or in his soul, or in the souls of the true believers. It was only in the ears of Kafirs, or inside their souls, which they thought to be part of the Qur’an. The wisdom of Allah entails that He destroys falsehood and establishes His revelations, so that the truth triumphs out of His Mercy to the people. Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise. The scholars of Islam are unanimously agreed on the infallibility of Messengers in all and everything that they convey from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to mankind.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q: There is a man in our area who lives alone and claims that he has Jinn (creatures created from fire) living in his house, and according to him, he cannot turn the lights on during the night, and most nights he closes his eyes. A few people who claim that they can deal with Jinn have visited his house and said that indeed Jinn live there and eat with him. He also claims that there is a female Jinni accompanies him. Is it true that the Jinn can control humans in that way? And, in our Shari`ah (Islamic law) is there a way to exorcise Jinn from this house? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, this may happen to some people. The Jinn may accompany a person and may lead him astray. They may convince the person with things that harm humans, and give them some foreseen information which they overhear or find out by traveling from one place to another. For example, they may tell a person that the prince of a country has passed away, or that someone has died in a certain country. The Jinn inform each other and are very quick in moving from one place to another. They can overhear things from the angels in the heavens and then inform their human companions. So, it is possible that humans have companions from the Jinn. A companion of Jinn is called a soothsayer and this has been happening for a long time. Every human has a devil and an angel as a companion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the man&#8217;s devil companion invites Jinn and they assist each other in carrying out their evil doings with this man or this woman. Thus, befriending Jinn and taking them as helpers or protectors, and using them to assist in harming or benefiting humans may happen and is possible. However, it is Haram (prohibited) for Muslims to befriend jinn, or use their services in soothsaying and witchcraft to harm humans. Rather, humans should beware of them, and Muslims are required to fight them in order to eliminate their evil doings. Also, rulers should send someone to ask the practitioners of witchcraft to repent and return to the truth and the right path, otherwise they will be tormented, beaten and jailed, until they abandon this mischief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the practitioners of witchcraft invoke or seek help from the Jinn, then they are to be warned that this is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam); and their punishment is death. However, if the ruler finds out that they claim to know Al-Ghayb (the Unseen) through the jinn and that such and such will happen, then they should be asked to repent, so either they repent or they are subject to capital punishment for being Kafirs (disbelievers). This is because claiming to know the Unseen is disbelief. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Say: &#8220;None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.&#8221; And: And to Allâh belongs the Ghaib (Unseen) of the heavens and the earth Allah (Exalted be He) told His Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.&#8221; So, if Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who is the best of creation, and the pre-eminent amongst the descendants of Adam does not know the Unseen, then why should anyone else have priority?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is Wajib (obligatory) to end this ordeal. As for the person whom you mentioned in your question who lives alone, claims that he has a female jinni companion, turns off the light of his house at night and closes his eyes, this is all part of disillusioning people and taking their money wrongfully as he tells them to do such and such a thing, and this and that will happen. Rulers who have a minimum adherence to Shari`ah should not leave this improper matter to continue as it is obligatory on any Muslim ruler to give a helping hand to these people to get rid of their sorcery and charlatanry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if this person repents and returns to Allah (Exalted be He) and the truth, Jinn will be driven away from him, because they only affect every sinful liar and those who befriend them. So, if he repents and returns to Allah (Exalted be He) and truthfully seeks refuge in Him from their evil, Allah (Exalted be He) will protect him from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the ways to prevent this is reciting Qur&#8217;an a lot, seeking refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah when one enters their house, and saying: &#8220;Bismillahi alladhi la yadurru ma`a ismihi shai&#8217;un fil-ardi wa-la fil-sama&#8217;i wa huwa al-Sami`u al-‘Alim (In the Name of Allah, with Whose Name nothing on the earth or in the heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">three times every morning and evening. By doing so, nothing can harm a person. A person should also say: &#8220;A‘udhu bi kalimatillah al-tammat min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created),&#8221; these are all ways of preventing and being safe from the evil of the devils, both jinn and human. It is not permitted that this person or similar people to admit to this falsehood and this charlatanry, sorcery and Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Shari`ah and Muslims of sound intellect) with which they lead people astray, and which does not affect anyone except those who are ignorant. May Allah grant us His Help!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: A man lives in a house in the desert which he inherited from his forefathers. On the second day of Ramadan, he experienced a calamity. He claims that ever since that night, he feels stones being thrown at him from inside and outside his house. The lights of the house go on and off, utensils break and he feels played with, without knowing who is doing this! This went on for several days, after which he consulted his clan hoping they would be of help to him. However, they told him that it was probably some of his enemies who were doing these terrible things to him. They accompanied him back to his house and when night fell and it became dark, they witnessed everything he had told them about and believed him. After that his family urged him to leave the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">How do you interpret this awful occurrence? What is its remedy? What is the legal ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This may be a group of devils from among the Jinn who are harassing him in order to drive him away from his home, or merely to annoy him. They may be taking revenge on him for having harmed them without him being aware. In any case, he should seek refuge with Allah and fortify himself by reciting the Qur’an in the house. He should also recite Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur’anic Verse of the Throne, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) upon lying down to sleep and seek refuge with Allah from the evil of what He has created by saying thrice, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">A‘udhu bi kalimat Allaah al-taammaat min sharri ma khalaq</span> (I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever he enters his house, he should say: “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Allahumma inni as’aluka khair al-mawlij wa khair al-makhraj. Bismillahi walajna, wa bismillah kharajna, wa ‘ala Allah rabbina tawkkalna</span> (O Allah! I ask you for the best entering and the best exiting. In the Name of Allah do we enter and in the Name of Allah do we exit, and in Allah, our Lord, we put our trust).” He should also say in the morning and in the evening (thrice): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismillahi alladhi la yadurru ma’ ismihi shai’un fil-ardi wa-laa fil-samaa’i wa huwa al-Samee’u al-‘Aleem</span> (“In the Name of Allah, with Whose Name nothing on the earth or in the heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, he should keep reciting the Qur’an in the house and elsewhere, and the Adhkar (oft-recited supplications) which are prescribed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to be said at specific times in the morning and the afternoon, at home or elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These supplications can be found in the books entitled <strong>Al- Kalim Al Tayyib</strong> by Ibn Taymiyah, <strong>Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib</strong> by Ibn Al-Qayyim, <strong>Al-Adhkar</strong> by Al-Nawawy and other books of Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullah) said:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Shaytaan tries to destroy the son of Adam in one of seven phases. Some of them are more intense than others. Shaytaan would not try to destroy him in the next phase until he fails to destroy him in a previous one.</p>
<p>These phases are: &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>1/ The phase of disbelief in Allah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Deen, His perfect attributes, and in what Rasulullah [Peace Be Upon Him] informed us about, and the fact that we will be resurrected. If Shaytaan is successful in misleading the slave in this phase, his enmity towards him would diminish and he would take rest. If the slave succeeds, and survives in this phase, Shaytaan would try to destroy him in the next phase.</p>
<p><strong>2/ The phase of Bid’ah (religious innovation)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether it pertains to believing in other than the truth which Rasulullah [Peace Be Upon Him] was sent with or by worshipping other than Allah; such as worshipping idols, and the like. Shaytaan enjoys that one succumbs in this phase, for Bid’ah conflicts with the nature of the Deen and compels one to reject it. Furthermore, the one who observes innovated religious practices would not repent from his actions; rather, he would invite people to his Bid’ah! Observing innovated religious practices would compel one to forge lies against Allah and speak without knowledge; thus it openly clashes with the Sunnah. Observing minor Bid’ah practices would lead one to observing major Bid’ah practices. In this manner, a person would eventually exit the folds of Islam. Scholars and people of knowledge alone know the real dangers of Bid’ah practices. If a person succeeds and survives in this phase by adhering to the Sunnah, and understanding its texts as the Pious Predecessors understood them, Shaytaan would seek to destroy him in the next phase.</p>
<p><strong>3/The phase of major sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is able to destroy the slave in this phase, he would beautify the deed that he is doing and probably compel him to say the following: “No sin would harm the Tawheed (creedal belief) as no good deed would benefit a man who has committed Shirk (i.e. to associate partners with Allah).?€? If the person is successful and survives this phase, Shaytaan would seek to destroy him in the next phase.</p>
<p><strong>4/ The phase of minor sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytaan would compel a person to belittle these sins, by whispering to him: “There is no fear upon you as long as you keep away from major sins- do you not know that the minor sins are expiated by abstaining from major sins?’?€? In this manner, Shaytaan would convince the individual that there is no harm in doing minor sins, until he regularly practices it. The person who has done a major sin, and has repented and is fearful of what he has done, would be better off than him; for regularly doing a minor sin would change it to a major sin! Constant repentance eliminates major sins; and on the same token, no minor sin remains a minor sin if one does it constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rasulullah [Peace Be Upon Him] said:-<br />
“Beware of minor sins; its likeness is like a people who stopped over in a valley, they spread out in search of fire wood, and each brought a stick; they were able to make a fire and cooked their bread. Whenever a person practices a minor sin regularly it would destroy him.?&#8221; (Ahmed)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slave succeeds and survives in this phase, by being careful and repenting continuously to Allah, and observing righteous deeds, Shaytaan seeks to destroy him in the next phase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5/Shaytaan entices the individual to excessively indulge in lawful things</strong> in order to keep him away from worshipping Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this manner, Shaytaan aims to make one abandon Sunnah practices, and later lead him to abandoning the obligatory practices. If the slave succeeds and survives in this phase by understanding the greatness of the acts of worship, he would seek to destroy him in the next phase.</p>
<p><strong>6/The phase of busying the slave with deeds which are less rewarding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytaan encourages the slave to observe certain acts of worship and beautifies them to him, and shows him the great reward of doing those acts of worship in order to keep him away from deeds which are more beneficial and rewarding.<br />
When Shaytaan fails to mislead the slave, he tries to deprive him from receiving the full reward; therefore, he busies him with lesser rewarding deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7/If Shaytaan fails in the above six phases, he would resort to harming the person in any way possible</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">by summoning his men and followers and riling them against this individual. The Prophets and Messengers were not left unharmed by this. One should bear patiently, for victory and success are tied with patience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Hadee Al-Madkhalee’s (may Allah preserve him) Story about Devils he’s seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong> number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">…He (the Shaytaan) surely sees you, he as well as his host, from whence you cannot see them …[Al-‘raf 27] Is this inability to see the Shaytan unrestricted , or is it possible for some people to see devils now and then?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes it is possible to see Shaytan. It has happened in the past as mentioned in the hadeeth about Hurayrah’s (may Allah be pleased with him) story. And the hadeeth about the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), He saw the Shaytan while praying. Furthermore I myself have seen devils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I saw a horse like I’ve never seen before in my entire life. One night my brother and I were traveling and we saw a very strange horse. This horse was in a place where there was no pasture and no people. My brother and I both knew that this horse was a devil. We didn’t want to scare each other, so when we got some distance from the horse, either he or I asked,” Do you know what that horse was?” I think he said,” It was a Gul-a Shaytan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on another occasion while riding in a car I saw a naked man. He wasn’t bald and he didn’t have hair. His outward appearance was very weird looking. Between his arms were two boys. These two boys had big heads and were bald. They were also skinny and with very small legs. Their features were very unusual. Another person and I saw this naked man. We both knew that those people were devils. After driving some distance I asked the man,” What was that?” He said,” They were devils.” I said,” That’s right!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people have seen devils, but in most cases devils aren’t visible. However nowadays there are some people who learn from Muhammad Abdu, a student from Afghanistan. Unfortunately, these people deny the existence of magic, and deny the possibility to see the Jinn. The origins of this believe comes from the Mu’tazeelah who use reason. They judge matters in the religion and life by using intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There isn’t anything that prohibits devils from being seen sometimes. I can definitely say to you that I’ve seen devils.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Shytaan appears as a sincere advisor to humans</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Source</strong> : Quoted in ibn al-Jauzi, Talbees Iblees, p.39</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you&#8221; (al-Araaf 21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahb ibn Munabbih has related the following lengthy story from the people of the book.&#8221; We present it here to show the way of Shytan in his attempt to mislead mankind. The story warns humans about Shytan&#8221;s &#8220;sincere advice&#8221;. One must oppose the thing that Shytan is calling to. Wahb said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a pious worshipper of the tribe of Israel. He was the most pious person of his time. During his time, there were three brothers who had a sister. She was a virgin. And they had no sister other than her. They were all about to leave the town to go to war. They did not know with whom to leave their sister and who they could trust to look after her. They all agreed to leave her with that pious person. They all trusted him. They went to him and asked if they could leave her with him. She would be in the building next to him until they return from the fighting. He refused their request and sought refuge in Allah from them and their sister. They persisted until he finally acquiesced. He said, &#8220;Put her in the house next to my place of worship.&#8221; So they put her in that house and they left, leaving her there. She remained living next to that pious person for some time. He would put food for her in front of his building of worship. Then he would lock the door and return to his place of worship. He would then tell her to come out of her house and take the food. Then Shytan approached him softly. He encouraged him to treat her kindly. He told him that it was not good to make the woman come out of her house during the day as someone may come upon her. If he took the food directly to her door that would mean a greater reward for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued for some time to go to her door and place the food at the front of her door without speaking to her. Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to do good and get more reward. He said, &#8220;If you took her the food and placed it in the house for her, you would get a greater reward.&#8221; He continued to encourage him. So he started to take the food into her house. He continued like that for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and again encouraged him to do good. He said, &#8220;If you talk to her for a while she will be put to ease by your conversation as she is in a state of fear and she is all alone.&#8221; He then started talking to her from atop his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again. He said, &#8220;If you were to come down and talk to her while she sits at her door and talks to you, that would be even more comforting for her.&#8221; He continued to encourage him until he came down and sat at his door and would talk to her. The girl would come out of her building and sit at her door and they would talk for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to get great rewards for treating her well. He said, &#8220;If you were to go from the door of your place of worship and sit close to her door, that would be even more comforting for her.&#8221; He continued exhorting him until he did so. He continued that act for a while. Then Iblees came again. This time he said, &#8220;If you enter her house and talk to her, and not make her show her face in public it would be even better for you.&#8221; He continued exhorting him until he entered her house and spent the whole day talking to her. Then when night fell, he returned to his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came to him after that and continued to make her more appealing to him. Until the worshipper got upon her and kissed her. And Iblees continued to make her look nice in his eyes and desire her until he finally had sex with her. She got pregnant and gave birth to a boy. Then Iblees came and told the worshipper, &#8220;Do you not realize what the brothers of the girl will do to you when they see she has given birth to your son&#8221; You will not be safe if your matter becomes clear. You should go to the boy and kill it and bury it, that way you can conceal your affair and they will not do anything to you for what you did to her.&#8221; Then he said to him, &#8220;Do you think she will conceal from her brothers what you did to her and your killing of her son. Take her, kill her and bury her with her son.&#8221; He continued spurring him on until he killed her and threw her in the ditch with her son. Then he put a large rock over them and leveled it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he returned to his place of worship and worshipped therein. He stayed in that state for as long as Allah willed until the brothers came back from the fighting. They came to him and asked him about their sister. He mourned her loss and started to cry. He said, &#8220;She was the best of women and that is her grave.&#8221; The brothers came to the grave and cried over their sister and asked Allah to have mercy on her. They stayed at her grave for a few days and then went to their families. When the night overtook them and they went to their beds, Shytan came to them in their sleep in the form of a traveler. He started with the eldest and asked him about their sister. The brother told him what the pious man had stated and how they were shown her grave. Shytan told him that the pious man had lied. He said, &#8220;He did not tell you the truth about your sister. He got her pregnant and she had his son and then he killed and buried her out of fear of you. Then he threw them in a ditch he dug behind the door of the house she was staying in, to the right of the entrance. Go and enter the house in which she stayed and on the right of the entrance you will find everything I told you about.&#8221; Then he went to the middle brother and did the same. Then he went to the youngest brother and did the same. When they woke, they were all surprised at what they had seen. When they met each other, they all said, &#8220;Isaw an amazing thing last night,&#8221; and they informed each other of what they had seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eldest said, &#8220;That dream has nothing to it so just ignore it.&#8221; The youngest said, &#8220;I will not leave it until I go and look at that place.&#8221; They all went until they reached the door of the place where there sister stayed. They opened the door and looked for the place that was described to them in their dreams. They found their sister and her son buried in a ditch, as they were told. They asked the worshipper about it and he confirmed what Iblees had told them. They then took him and were about to crucify him. When they had him on the wooden cross, Shytan said to him, &#8220;You know that I am your companion who tempted you by the woman until you got her pregnant and you killed her and her son. If you obey me today and deny Allah, who formed and shaped you, I will rescue you from your predicament.&#8221; The worshipper then belied Allah. When he belied Allah, Shytan left from being between him and the others and they were able to crucify him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars related this story in their commentary to the following verse,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Or the likeness of Shytan when he tells man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieves, says to him,  &#8220;Lo! I am innocent of you. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds&#8221; &#8221; (Surah al-Hasr 16).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They mention that this verse refers to this worshipper and to others similar to him. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">This story, and others similar to it, are from the Israaeeliyaat or stories which have their source in the books or tales of the Jews and Christians. We do not say it is true nor do we say it is false, but it is allowed to narrate them as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Narrate stories about the Tribe of Israel if there is no harm in that.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Question asked to <strong>Shaykh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is a man who suffers from the whisperings of Shaytan. [Shaytan] whispers things to him that are great sins, concerning Allaah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and [the man] is very much afraid of this; what is the advice of your eminence?</span></p>
<p>Answer by Shaykh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding what has been mentioned concerning the problem of the questioner, which is that he fears the result of it, I say to him: Rejoice at the good news that there will be no result from it except a good result. This is the whispering by which Shaytan assails the believers in order to upset the sound belief in their hearts and to cause them sprirtual and mental agitation and disturb the serenity of their faith, indeed the serenity of their lives, if they are believers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not the first among the people of faith to be confronted by this situation, nor is he the last, for it will continue as long as there is a believer in the world; and this same situation confronted the companions (radiAllaahu &#8216;anhum), for it was reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (radiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some people from among the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) came to the Messenger and said to him, &#8216;Verily we perceive in our minds that which every one of us considers too grave to express.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8216;Do you really perceive it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Upon this he (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8216;That is true faith.'&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter of Explanation of the (evil) whispering regarding Faith (132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs, it is also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (radiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Satan may come to anyone of you and say: &#8216;Who created such and such? Who created such and such?&#8217; until he says, &#8216;Who created your Lord?&#8217; So, when he inspires such a question, one should seek refuge with Allaah and give up such thoughts.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Beginning of Creation, in the Chapter: The description of Iblis and his Legions (3276) and it was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter on the Description of the (evil) Whispering regarding Faith (134).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Abbas (radiAllaahu anhuma) that a man came to the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allaah! One of us has thoughts of such a nature that he would rather be reduced to charcoal than speak about them.&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;All praise and thanks be to Allaah, Who has reduced his matter (shaytan&#8217;s guile) to (evil) whispering.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It was reported by Abu Dawud in the Book of Good Manners, in the Chapter: Regarding the response to (evil) Whispering (5112) and by Imam Ahmed in Al-Musnad (1:340)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in the Book of Faith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The believer is put to trial by the whispering of Satan, the whispering of kufr which causes him distress, as the companions (radiAllaahu &#8216;anhum) said: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allah! One of us has thoughts within himself of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than speak of them.&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is true faith&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;he considers it too grave to express.&#8221; He (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise and thanks are Allaah&#8217;s, Who has reduced his (shaytan) intrigue to (evil) whispering).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, the occurence of his whispering along with this great hatred for it and repelling it from the heart is a part of true faith, like the warrior in Allaah&#8217;s Cause who met the enemy and fought him until he overcame him, for that is a great Jihad up to his words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the seekers of knowledge and worship are assailed by whispering and uncertainty which do not afflict another, because he (the other) does not follow the Law of Allaah and His way; rather, he follows his own desires, heedless of the rememberance of his Lord and this is the goal of Shaytan, as opposed to those who turn towards their Lord with knowledge and (acts of) worship, for he is their enemy and he seeks to prevent them from (worshipping) Allaah, the Most High.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I say to this questioner: once it is clear to you that this whispering is from Shaytan, then you must struggle and stand against it, know that it will never harm you as long as you undertake the necessary struggle, reject it and cease thinking about it. The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Allaah has forgiven what is whispered in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it into action or utter it.&#8221; [(Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Manumission, in the Chapter: Error and Forgetfulness in Manumission and Divorce (2528) and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Allah has forgiven what is whispered in heart (127)]</p>
<p>And if it is said to you:</p>
<p>Do you believe what is whispered to you? And do you think it is the truth? And is it possible to describe Allaah, the Most Glorified by it? You would say: It is not for us to speak of this; Glorified are You (Oh Allaah), this is a great lie! You would reject it with your heart and by your words; and of the people, you would flee further than any of them from it. Then it is, only whispering and perils displayed to your heart, and a window to polythesim from Shaytan, who courses throughout the human body as blood courses through it, in order to destroy and obscure your deen for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why you find that Shaytan does not place doubt or rejection about trivial things in your heart, so you hear for example, of the existence of large and important cities filled with residents and buildings in the east and west and yet doubt their existence never once crossed your mind, nor regarding their faults, such as that their buildings are destroyed or are unfit for habitation or that there are no occupants in them and so on. There is no goal for Shaytan in making mankind doubt such things. But Shaytan&#8217;s important great goal is destroying the faith of the believer, so he strives by his horse, and on foot, to extinguish the light of knowledge and guidance in one&#8217;s heart and to cause him to fall into the darkness of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) explained the beneficial medicine which contains a cure for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Then let him seek refuge with Allah and cease doing it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person ceases doing that and continues to worship Allah, seeking &amp; desiring that which is with Allaah, it will stop troubling him, by Allaah&#8217;s Power. So, avoid all suppositions which pass through your heart on this subject and worship Allaah, supplicate to Him and glorfiy Him, and if you heard anyone describing Him with what was whispered to him, you would kill him if you could. Therefore, what is whispered is not a fact; rather it is simply thoughts and whisperings which have no basis. Like in the case of someone wearing a clean garment which he has just washed and then he is assailed by thoughts that &#8220;maybe it is impure,&#8221; and &#8220;maybe it is not permissble to pray in it,&#8221; but he should pay no heed to this.</p>
<p><strong>And my advice may be summarized as follows:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seek protection with Allaah and completely stop these suppositions as the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) ordered us to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Mention Allaah, the Most High and restrain yourself from this whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Wholehearted dedication to worship and acting in accordance with the Command of Allaah and seeking His Pleasure, for when you give worship your undivided attention with earnestness and striving, you will forget about occupying yourself with this whispering, InshaAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Seeking refuge with Allaah much and asking Him to protect you from this thing.And I ask Allaah, the Most High for protection for you and safety from every evil and every destable thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A modern day experience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This experiment took place with the author Ahmad Izzuddin al-Bayanuni. He mentioned it in his book Kitab al-Iman bil-Malaaika. I eagerly decided to quote the complete text of what he wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the East and the West have preoccupied themselves with the claim of making the spirits appear. There have been many articles written about it, written in different languages, published in Arabic as well as non-Arabic magazines. Books have been written about it. Much research has been done lately on this topic. Many experiments have been performed. After all of that, the intelligent people have concluded that the raising of the spirits is nothing but falsehood and forgery, a call to disbelief and wickedness.<span id="more-41293"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What they claim to be the appearing of the spirits of people who have passed away is nothing but fakery and forgery. The spirits that appear are nothing but devils that are playing with and duping humans. In reality, there is no one who is capable of making the spirits appear. After the spirit leaves the body it goes to reside in the realm called al-Barzakh which is the interval between this worldly life and the life of the hereafter. Therein the person is either in bounties or punishment. They are preoccupied there with a great affair which would prevent them from appearing before the humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [al-Bayanuni] was called to such an act of these spiritualists. And I experienced my own lengthy experience. This experience made it clear to me that it is nothing but falsehood, forgery and deception. It is just the playing of the devils. They present that to the people to mislead them and to deceive them and to make humans follow them.</p>
<p><strong>The beginning of the experience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had known for more than ten years of a person who claimed that he was using the jinn to do good deeds in the service of mankind. And that was done through a person who was a medium. He claimed that he achieved that through recitations and lengthy invocations which took up a great deal of time. He was instructed in thorough incantations by someone who claimed he was knowledgeable in that area. The medium came to me one day telling me that so and so of the jinn had called for me to discuss something important and there was a great matter in store for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the appointment, trusting in Allah and very happy about it, in order to learn new information through this experience.</p>
<p><strong>How did the deception begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first deceiving step that they took with me, in the process of bringing forth the spirits, was to have me ask Allah for forgiveness, glorify him and other acts of dhikr. This would make a person believe, at first glance, that he is meeting with spirits who are pure, holy and truthful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered the house of the medium and we were alone together in a room The medium sat on the bed. And we began &#8211; 0bviously under his guidance with asking forgiveness and sanctifying Allah- until he became like in a trance and I laid him down on his bed. I covered him with a covering in the way I was told to do. Then in a low voice, his companion greeted me. His knowing me and his like for me were obvious. He introduced me to himself. He claimed to be a created being. He was not from the angels or the jinn but was of another creation, a different species. He came into being by Allah&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Be&#8221; and he was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person of the voice claimed that the jinn only appeared through his command. And that between him and receiving the command from Allah there was only four intermediaries, with the Angel Gabriel being the fifth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began to praise me. He said that they will cut off any meetings they have with other humans and they shall only meet with me. Because, they claimed, I was a special person of this age. And this was a special sanction from Allah and it was Allah who had chosen me for that. And they made me a glittering promise full of amazing things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I accepted this new experience and false call with trust in Allah and asking Allah to protect me from error and to guide me to the clear truth, enlightened by the light of knowledge and following the path of steadfastness and praising Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the first meeting, he promised me a second meeting. Then the person himself instructed me to make some special incantations to awake the medium from his absence. That was done. And the medium was sitting. His eyes opened as if he had been wakened from a deep sleep and did not know what had transpired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went back for the second appointment also. Then we had many meetings, one after another, for a long time. During every meeting, they renewed their good promise to me and described a great future for me and the great blessings that the nation would receive at my hands.</p>
<p><strong>The situation develops</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation developed further. Many &#8220;spirits&#8221; came to visit me in every meeting. Some with invocations being made before the meeting while others without it. While eating or drinking tea with the medium, the medium would fall asleep with his head down at the promised time. And the &#8220;spirits&#8221; would appear, some claiming to be angels or from the jinn or companions of the Prophet or saints. They would always speak with reverence and respect. They would invoke blessings for my visit and point to a blessed future. Then they would leave and others would come.</p>
<p><strong>Who were those visitors ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was visited by beings that claimed to be angels, jinn, Abu Huraira, scholars, &#8220;saints&#8221;, such as Abu al-Hasan al-Shaadhili, well known and accepted scholars, such as al-Shaikh Ahmad al-Tirmaaneeni, and some scholars that I had met before and had known of their deaths, including my father (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They gave me glad tidings of my father&#8217;s visit at a specific time. I looked forward to this meeting with anxiety. When it was time for the meeting, they requested me to read Surah al- Waqiah aloud. read it. When I finished reciting it, they said, &#8220;Your father will appear after a few moments. Listen to what he says and do not ask him about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The beginning of my vigilance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a few minutes, there came someone who claimed to be my father. He greeted me. He showed his happiness for meeting me. And he was happy with me for meeting those spirits. He advised me to assist the medium and his family and to take care of them in the best way as he had no other means of making money except through this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ended his speech with &#8220;the prayers on the Prophet Abraham&#8221;. And I knew that my father was passionately fond of saying the prayers upon the Prophet (peace be on him), especially in &#8220;the prayer of Abraham&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most amazing thing was that his accent was exactly the same as my father&#8217;s. He said salaam and left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I began to ask myself, &#8220;Why did they advise me not to ask him about anything?&#8221;. For a secret reason no doubt. The secret reason became clear to me at that moment. It was not my father. It was his ?partner? from the jinn, the one who accompanied him throughout his life. He came to me in the form of my father and imitated his most particular characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advised me not to ask him about anything because the &#8220;partner&#8221; from the jinn, no matter to what extent he knows and remembers about my father, he is not able to remember every detail that a son knows about his father. They feared that if I asked him something of that nature, he would not be able to respond and the matter would become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With others, 1 would meet them and not know who they were until they were about to leave and then they would say, &#8220;I am so and so,&#8221; greet me and leave immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was also a secret reason for that: If any of them would tell me who they were, and he was well-known for being knowledgeable, I could discuss a difficult topic with him and he would not be able to respond. Again, the matter would then be uncovered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time someone came and debated with me saying that the face of the woman is not aurah [or from the private parts that must be covered] and need not be covered. I refuted him and he responded to me with a response that had no aspect of knowledge in it. The argument became heated between us, I said to him, &#8220;How do you respond to those jurists who say that the face of the woman is aurah and she must cover out of fear of fitnah [temptation and sin]?&#8221; The argument ended without any benefit. Then he told me that he was Shaikh Ahmad al-Tarmaaneeni and he left. It became clear to me that he was undoubtedly a liar because Shaikh al-Tarmaaneeni was a leading Shafi scholar and the leaders of the Shafi school say that all of the woman is aurah, even if she is an aged, gray-haired woman. If he really was the shaikh he said he was and he had discovered some new knowledge in the world of barzakh he would have informed me about it and shown me its evidence. But it was all a lie and deception. Its intention was misguidance. And Allah &#8211; and all praises are due to Allaah &#8211; refused except to guide me and confirm me on the truth and guidance. A woman uncovering her face, especially in times like these with moral laxity and a sick society, is something no knowledgeable or religious person would agree to.</p>
<p><strong>The reality becomes uncovered</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality of the situation became more and more uncovered meeting after meeting and experience after experience. Finallv. I was certain that all of it were lies and forgeries. It had no in righteousness and no root standing in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the medium, who I was advised generously, was known not to pray and he was not his prayers. His beard was shaven and no one ordered to help and treat ordered to perform him to let it grow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, he devours the wealth of the people through falsehood and deceiving promises. There is no source of income for him except through that evil means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to me after he heard that I had some relation with that medium and complained to me about his deception. He took 300 Syrian riyals from him and the man was a poor person who was very much in need of that money. I insisted that the medium return the money to him. He did so, in his and his devils&#8217; hope that I would continue to meet with them. The medium and his family base most of their entire lives on lying.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those spirits, after everything became clear to me, tried to threaten me. But that did not shake my heart whatsoever. And all praises are to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to record what they used to say to me. These recordings filled two large files. I recorded most of what they said to me. When it became unquestionably clear to me that it was all fake, without any other way to explain it, I made my final judgment about them and burned the two files that were filled with lies and forgeries. Those spirits who claimed to be Companions of the Prophet, saints and pious people were all devils. No intelligent believer should be deceived by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the ways that are taken to make the spirits appear are nothing but lies and falsehood. It does not matter if it is through a or medium, as in the experience I had, or through a table or tea cup, that some people have experienced and mentioned to me. All of them end in the same result that I reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wonderful thing is that I have seen other people write on this topic and the conclusion of the intelligent people who experienced these things is the same conclusion I arrived at. They concluded that those spirits are nothing but the &#8220;partners&#8221; of humans from among the jinn, as Allah had guided me to. And all praise is to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> (rahimahullah) writes in <strong>Igaathat al-Lahfaan</strong> (1/242),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the plots and traps of the enemy of Allah, with which he seeks to trap those who posses little knowledge, reasoning and religious commitment and trap the ignorant is the listening to whistling and clapping of hands and singing accompanied by forbidden musical instruments, which closes people’s hearts to the Qur’aan and makes them devoted to immorality and sin. This is the ‘qur’an’ of the Shaytan, an impenetrable barrier which blocks them from the Most Merciful. This is the means that leads to sodomy and fornication, by means of which the Shaytan ensnares the hearts of those who follow falsehood and makes it appear attractive to them by way of deceit and trickery. He inspires them by means of specious arguments to regard it as something good, so they accept this idea, and for the sake of singing they forsake the Qur’aan…&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ibn al-Jawzi made an exceptionable parable about this battle between man and Shytaan. He said in Talbees Iblees,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The heart is like a fort that is surrounded by a wall and the wall has gates from which it can be torn down. In it lies the mind. The angels frequent that fort and next to that fort are places where the desires lie. And the devils enter into this surrounding area without being prevented from doing so. And the war exists between the inhabitants of the fort and the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The devils never stop circling the fort and looking for an opening where the guard is heedless and from where he can tear down the fort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">It is obligatory for the guards to be completely aware of all of the gates of the fort that must be guarded as well as all of its weak points from which destruction can come. The guard cannot take a break because the enemy never takes a break. A man sai al-Hasan al-Basri, &#8220;Does Iblees sleep?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;If he were to sleep we could then have a rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The fort is lit by the remembrance of Allah and faith in Him. In it is a polished looking glass through which [the guardians] can then see anything that passes by. The first thing that Shytaan does is to blow smoke into the fort to make its walls black. This causes rust and damage in the fort. Sound thought repels Shytaan and remembrance of Allah cleans the looking glass. The enemy has carriages and sometimes they are able to enter the fort. The guards may come upon them and force them to leave. Perhaps they may enter due to the heedlessness or carelessness of the guards. Perhaps, due to the smoke and the rust, Shytaan enters through any way and he is not perceived. Perhaps the guard is injured by the heedlessness or is taken prisoner and led to the following of the desires. &#8216;</span></p>
