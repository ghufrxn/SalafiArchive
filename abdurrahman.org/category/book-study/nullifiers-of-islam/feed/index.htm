</a>The Ninth Invalidator: Believing That Some Have The Choice To Leave Of The Sharee&#8217;ah Of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever believes that some of the people have been given the choice to leave off the Sharee&#8217;ah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), just as al-Khidr was given the choice to go outside the jurisdiction of the Sharee&#8217;ah of Moosa (alayhi assalam), then he has disbelieved. That is because every Prophet was sent specifically to his own people, so it is not obligatory for all the people to follow them. As for our Prophet, Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), then he was sent for all peoples, so it is not lawful for anyone to oppose him, not to leave off his Sharee&#8217;ah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:158)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) not but as a mercy for the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists).</span> (Al-Anbiya 21:107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;ân) to His slave (Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he may be a warner to the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind and jinns).</span> (Al-Furqan 25:1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have not sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not</span>. (Saba&#8217; 34:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al-Ansaaree (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa), that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was given five things that no one before me was given: [i] I was aided by causing intimidation for a months time; [ii] the entire earth was made a masjid (place of prostration) and pure for me, so regardless of where a man from my Ummah is, whenever the Prayer reaches him, he may pray; [iii] and the spoils of war have been made lawful for me and they were not made lawful for anyone before me; [iv] and I have been given the intercession (shafaa&#8217;ah); [v] and <strong>every Prophet was sent specifically to his people and I have been sent to all of mankind</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(al-Bukhaaree no. 328 &amp; Muslim no. 521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.</span> (Aali Imran 3:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned. (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in a hadeeth,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah if Moosaa was living, he would have no choice but to follow me&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Da&#8217;eef &#8211; Shaykh Muqbil &amp; Hasan by al-Albaanee al Irwaa&#8217; no. 1589 &amp; mentioned in Ibn Katheer of this verse)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Al-Wasaabee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned to us that this ninth invalidator has a connection to the third invalidator, which is not stating the Christians and the Jews as disbelievers as Allaah has mentioned them as being disbelievers. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has certain things that are specific to him, no other Prophet were given these things; one of these is that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent for all the people. This is unlike the other Prophets who were sent specifically for their people and this is mentioned directly in the text from the Hadith from Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al- Ansaaree (radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) has completed the revelation with Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that there remains no deen after Muhammad except Islaam and whoever holds onto anything other than Islaam then it will not be accepted from him. Also, his works will be refuted and not accepted. Whoever, from the people who have had news of this deen reach them, and verily the news of this deen of Islaam and Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has reached all the people, and they do not believe in it they will be the people of the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also mentioned, concerning the verse in Sooratul Ma&#8217;idah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it was revealed in the farewell pilgrimage of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that after he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) returned from the hajj to Medina he lived for a few days. Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this ayah is a great verse and that it explains the greatness of Islaam until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221; (al-Bukhaaree no. 6800)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that the Muslims to do not take their celebrations and their &#8216;Eid from themselves. The Muslims have 3 &#8216;Eids, &#8216;Eid of fitr and the &#8216;Eid of adha, which are the two &#8216;Eids that come yearly and the third &#8216;Eid which is yawmul Jum&#8217;ah. The Muslims do not take their &#8216;Eids like the Jews and Christians, who take their &#8216;Eids at every single matter, like for example the celebration of the birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that anyone who takes a deen other than Islaam it will not be accepted from them and that there is no excuse that we enter is Islaam and that we don&#8217;t pray, hear and obey. Our return is to Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) using the explanation of the verse,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.</span> (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our deen, the deen of Islaam, has abrogated all of the deens, and that there remains no other deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh mentioned to us the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) the Book (this Qur&#8217;ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:48)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">AUTHOR:Imaam ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> SOURCE: Nawaaqid-ul-Islaam</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O Muslim brother that Allaah has obligated all of His servants to enter the fold of Islaam, to hold tightly onto it and to beware of those things that oppose it. And He sent His Prophet, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), to call the people to that, informing us that whoever follows him is guided, whereas whoever turns away from him is astray. In many ayaat (verses) of the Qur’aan, He has warned us about the things that cause one to apostate as well as all the rest of the types of Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, have mentioned in their chapters on the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ruling of the Apostate”</strong></span>, that a Muslim may apostate from his Religion through various types of Nullifiers (of Faith), which cause his life and wealth to become permissible (for taking) and which causes him to leave from the fold of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the most dangerous amongst them and those that occur most often are ten nullifiers [1] that we will mention to you in the following lines, in a summarized manner, so that you may beware of them and warn others about them, hoping that Allaah will protect and safeguard us from them. We will also mention a few short clarifications after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">First</span>: </strong>Shirk (associating partners) in the worship of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him in worship (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily, the one who mixes partners in worship with Allaah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into this is supplicating and invoking the deceased, seeking assistance from them, as well as making oaths to them and offering sacrificial animals to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Second</span>:</strong> Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allaah, asking them to intercede on his behalf, and relying on them, has committed disbelief according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Third</span>:</strong> Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Fourth</span>:</strong> Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is more complete than his guidance and that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement, such as those who prefer the judgement of the Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot; false deities/religions) over his judgement, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Fifth</span>:</strong> Whoever hates something that the Messenger came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved, based on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“That is because they disliked what Allaah sent down, so He nullified their (good) deeds.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Muhammad: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Sixth</span>:</strong> Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s Religion or its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Say: ‘Was it Allaah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses, you have disbelieved after having had faith.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah At-Tawbah: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Seventh</span>:</strong> Sorcery, which includes magic spells that causes a person to hate (sarf) [2] or love (‘atf) [3] someone/something. So whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done, has committed disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had first said to them: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Eighth</span>:</strong> Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And whoever amongst you takes them (i.e. the disbelievers) as allies and protectors then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allaah does not guide a wrong-doing [4] people.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Ninth</span>:</strong> Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharee’ah (revealed laws) of Muhammad (i.e. Islaam), then he is a disbeliever, according to Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And whoever seeks a Religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Tenth</span>:</strong> Turning away from Allaah’s Religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And who does more wrong [5] than he who is reminded [6] of the ayaat (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away [7] from them. Verily, We shall extract retribution [8] from the criminals.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah As-Sajdah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference, with regard to (committing any of) these nullifiers, between the one who jokes, the one who is serious or the one who does so out of fear. However, the one who commits them due to being coerced (is excused). All of these (ten) matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. So the Muslim must beware of them and fear from these acts befalling him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into the Fourth Nullifier are those who believe that the man-made laws and constitutions that the people have legislated are better than the Sharee’ah (laws) of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who believe that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islaam in the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that this is a cause for the backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that it is limited to only playing a part in the relationship between the servant and his Lord and that it should not interfere in the other affairs of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this fourth category are those who hold that carrying out Allaah laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this category are those who believe that it is permissible to rule by other than the Laws of Allaah (Sharee’ah) in matters of interactions, penal laws and so on, even if he doesn’t believe that it is better than ruling by the Sharee’ah. This is since by doing this, he will be making lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, according to the unanimous consensus (Ijmaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that makes lawful that which Allaah has prohibited from the matters that one is required to know by necessity, such as fornication, alcohol, interest and ruling by other than Allaah’s Laws, then he is a disbeliever according to the Ijmaa’ (unanimous consensus) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment. May the peace and blessings be on the best of His creatures, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FOOTNOTES:</b></p>

<h3 style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:#993300;"><u>الأَوَّلُ</u></span><u> : </u><br />
الشِّرْكُ فِي عِبَادَةِ اللهِ، قَالَ تَعَالَى: <strong>﴿</strong> <strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</strong> <strong>﴾</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> وَقَالَ تَعَالَى: <strong>﴿</strong><strong> إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ</strong> <strong>﴾</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> وَمِنْهُ الذَّبْحُ لِغَيْرِ اللهِ، كَمَنْ يَذْبَحُ لِلْجِنِّ أَوْ لِلْقَبْرِ.</h3>

<h2><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>English Translation of the Text </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(Translated by al-ibaanah publihers)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>THE FIRST NULLIFIER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Nullifiers of Islaam are ten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: Shirk (associating partners) in the worship of Allaah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him in worship (i.e. Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, the one who mixes partners in worship with Allaah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into this is performing sacrifices to someone other than Allaah, such as the person who offers a sacrifice to the Jinn or to a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE SECOND NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allaah, calling unto them and asking intercession from them, and seeking reliance in them, has committed disbelief according to the unanimous agreement (Ijmaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE THIRD NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE FOURTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is more complete than his guidance and that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement, such as the one who prefers the judgement of the Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot; false deities/religions) over his judgement, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE FIFTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifth: Whoever hates something that the Messenger came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE SIXTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sixth: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s Religion or its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Was it Allaah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses, you have disbelieved after having had faith.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE SEVENTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seventh: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that cause a person to hate something he seeks after (sarf) or love something he doesn’t seek after (‘atf). So whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done, has committed disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had first said to them: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’”</span> [Surah AlBaqarah: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE EIGHTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eighth: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And whoever amongst you takes them (i.e. the disbelievers) as allies and protectors then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allaah does not guide a wrong-doing people.”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE NINTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninth: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharee’ah (revealed laws) of Muhammad (i.e. Islaam), just as it was permitted for Al-Khidr to be free from the Sharee’ah of Moosaa, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">THE TENTH NULLIFIER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tenth: Turning away from Allaah’s Religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayaat (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away from them. Verily, We shall extract retribution from the criminals.” [</span>Surah As-Sajdah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference, with regard to (committing any of) these nullifiers, between the one who jokes, the one who is serious or the one who does so out of fear. However, the one who commits them due to being coerced (is excused). All of these (ten) matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. So the Muslim must beware of them and fear from these acts befalling him. We seek refuge in Allaah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment. May the peace and blessing be on the best of His creatures, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Read the Article:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that Allaah (<em>subhanahu wa ta’ala</em>: Far is He removed from every imperfection, the Most High) made it very clear that mankind must follow Islaam, hold to it and dissociate from whatever contradicts it. The declaration that <em>Laa Ilaaha Illallaah</em> &#8220;There is none worthy of worship except Allaah&#8221; not only negates all false deities and confirms worship only to Allaah, it also requires the complete dissociation from any form of worship to any false deity;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taaghut (false deities) and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 2: 256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, to declare that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam: may Allaah Exalt his mention and safeguard him and his message) is the Messenger and slave of Allaah requires the belief that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is trusted by Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to deliver the Message of Islaam, and that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is to be followed and obeyed because Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) decreed in the Qur’an:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is severe in punishment.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur&#8217;an 59: 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the ways and methods that are needed by the Muslim to fulfill this declaration of Tawheed [2] are explained in the Qur&#8217;an and by the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) and His Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) warned that there are ways that lead to Shirk,[3] Kufr [4] and rejection of Faith. The Muslim must be very knowledgeable about Tawheed so that he does not indulge in practices and concepts that contradict the essence of Islaam. The most dangerous and widely existing ways that breach Tawheed are:</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: Shirk in the worship of Allah: to associate something and/or anyone in the worship of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah forgives not setting up rivals in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases other sins than that.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 4: 116)</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up rivals in worship with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Al-Jannah for him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur’an 5: 72)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: Setting up intermediaries between a person and Allaah is Kufr (disbelief): calling upon them and seeking their intercession and depending upon them. Those who do this are taking &#8220;associates&#8221; with Allaah and this is Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then set not up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshiped).</span></em> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) was asked: <strong>&#8216;Which sin is the Gravest? He said: &#8220;That you set up rivals unto Allaah (despite the fact) that He has created you.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَدْعُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ ۖ فَإِن فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِّنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And call not on other than Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of Ath-thalimeen (who commit Shirk)&#8221;.</span> </em>(Qur’an 10:106)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: Believing that the Mushrikeen (those who commit Shirk) are not Kufar or doubting their Kufr or defending and correcting the beliefs of the Kufar, is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And if any amongst you who take them (wholeheartedly) as friends, then surely he is one of them.&#8221;</em></span>(Qur&#8217;an 5: 51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest contradictions to Tawheed. Here it is important to caution that many Muslims are reluctant (and feel ashamed) to say the word &#8220;Kufr&#8221; to describe a disbeliever or to point out their acts of Shirk. Some even look at the Kufar with great deal of admiration, fear and obedience. Those have an inferiority complex that leads them to become blind followers and defenders of the Kufar and their ways. They are at grave danger since this may “melt” their identity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim&#8217;s position about these matters must be dissociation from Kufr and Shirk, but Love for Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala), His Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) and the believers:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَتَّخِذِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَن تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً ۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ ۗ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ  </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Awliyaa&#8217; (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allaah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allaah warns you against Himself (His punishment), and to Allaah is the final return.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 3: 28)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOUR</strong>: The belief that guidance by someone other than the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is better or that ruling by other than the rule of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is better, then this is Kufr. The rule of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is the rule of Allaah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no true Faith (al-waajib: which is dutiful upon them), until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept (them) fully with submission.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 4: 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The belief that systems and laws made by human beings are better than, or equal to the Sharee&#8217;ah of Islaam; or that Islamic system is not suitable for the contemporary times, and that Islaam is the cause of backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The belief that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala), such as cutting of the hand of the thief or the stoning of an adulterer, is not suitable for this day and age.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIVE</strong>: Hating any command or anything of the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) Message despite practicing it is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَرِهُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَالَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That is because they hate that which Allaah has sent down, so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur&#8217;an 47: 9)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SIX</strong>: Mocking any part of Islaam or any of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes is Kufr. Allaah, the Most High, says (what means):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّمَا كُنَّا نَخُوضُ وَنَلْعَبُ ۚ قُلْ أَبِاللَّهِ وَآيَاتِهِ وَرَسُولِهِ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِئُونَ لَا تَعْتَذِرُوا قَدْ كَفَرْتُم بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ ۚ إِن نَّعْفُ عَن طَائِفَةٍ مِّنكُمْ نُعَذِّبْ طَائِفَةً بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا مُجْرِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Was it at Allaah, and His signs, and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuse, you have disbelieved (became Kufar) after you had believed.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 9: 65-66)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SEVEN</strong>: Involvement in Magic: considering it permissible to practice and spread ways that may (i) sway man from the good things he likes (e.g., using magic to sow discord between a man and his wife) or (ii) reduce man to do what he dislikes or is bad for him. These ways of magic are Satanic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Solomon did not disbelieve but the devils disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels (put coma after the word angels) Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said: We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning the magic from us).&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 2: 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, we see many people seek help from the so called fortunetellers. They believe that these tellers know what will happen. This is Kufr. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) warned that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a priest (soothsayer or a fortuneteller), and believes him in what he says has committed Kufr and denied what was revealed to Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam)”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EIGHT</strong>: Standing by the Mushrikeen, supporting them and helping them against the Muslims (so that mushrikeen will be the prevalent ones) is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And he amongst you who take them as friends (WHOLEHEARTEDLY), then surely he is one of them.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur&#8217;an 5: 51)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NINE</strong>: Believing that some &#8220;special&#8221; people don&#8217;t have to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is Kufr because this negates the second part of the declaration of Tawheed &#8216;Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allaah,” since this constitutes desiring a &#8220;religion&#8221; other than Islaam. Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever desires a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 3: 85)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TEN</strong>: Completely turning away from the religion of Allaah, not learning it and practicing it, is Kufr.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا ۚ إِنَّا مِنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does wrong than the one to whom are recited the Aayat (proofs, evidences, verses, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then he turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimin (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners etc.)&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur’an 32: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He, the Most High, also says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا عَمَّا أُنذِرُوا مُعْرِضُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 46:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic hadeeth reported in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; (a collection of authentic narrations verified by the Scholar of hadeeth Sheikh Muhammad Nassir Ad-Deen al-Albaani) V.2 # 5939. Believing in sorcery and horoscopy is as setting up rivals with Allaah. This is Shirk.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Finally, it must be pointed out that there is no difference (in accountability) between the one who seriously commits any of the above acts or the one who claims to be just &#8220;joking&#8221;, &#8220;playing&#8221; or &#8220;mocking&#8221;!</strong></span> The only exception is when someone commits any of these acts under compulsion; even then his heart must be filled with faith and Tawheed of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another serious matter is that the issue of declaring someone Kufr (rulers or ruled). This is not left for the unlearned of the common Muslims or heads of hizbee-groups or the like. It is to be left to the reliable scholars who follow the Qur’an, authentic Sunnah in the context of the Salaf’s way of understanding the Deen, not to innovators and the politically and emotionally driven ones. We must fear Allah in this matter which had caused and is still causing deviation in the Ummah at large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from such deeds and we ask Him to make the truth clear to us all.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Appendix<br />
<strong><span style="color:#800000;">Definition of Taaghut</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taaghut: Derived from Tughyaan, exceeding the limits. So:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Whatever is worshipped instead of or to the exclusion of Allaah is a Taaghut. So, any human being who is pleased to be set as an object of worship is a Taaghut.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The one who exceeds the limits concerning following and obedience to other than Allaah, and sets others as rivals with Allaah, then himself is a Taaghut.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Those who make Istihlaal, making the unlawful lawful or vice versa, and are obeyed for that are Taaghut, because they are being set as Lords besides Allah. Here it must be known that obeying them on their Istihlaal is divided into three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The person obeys them while pleased and content by their saying, giving precedence to their judgments, and discontent with Allaah’s ruling, then he is a Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The person obeys them while accepting Allaah’s ruling and knowing that it is the best and the most fitting to man, but due to lowly desire in himself he chooses otherwise. For example, he may be seeking a job, and so forth. In this case it is not Kufr, rather he is a Faasiq (rebellion, disobedient).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The person obeys them due to ignorance, thinking that their rulings are those of Allaah’s. This is subdivided into two cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The person is able to know the truth by himself, but he is negligent. In this case he is sinful, because Allaah ordered to ask the people of knowledge when matters are not known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The person is not knowledgeable and unable to learn but he follows them by way of blind following believing that it is the truth. In this case there is nothing upon him, i.e not held blameworthy. [See Al-Qawlul Muffed ‘Alaa Kitaab at-Tawheed, by our Shayekh Muhammad bin Salih Al-‘Uthaimeen, v.2, pp. 157-158, with slight adaptation].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It covers also all that which opposes Allaah&#8217;s Judgment. And this is of different levels and ranks. Some may lead to exiting the fold of Islam, while others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Some examples on Taaghut:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those followed, like soothsayers, magicians, and evil “scholars,” are Taaghut. Those pleased for being worshipped besides Allaah, as well as idols, are Taaghut</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Very Important to Remember</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(i) General Statements of Imputation of Kufr.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is known as Itlaaq-ut-Takfeer: stating in the general sense, such as to say, “whoever does or says such and such,”from what is known to be Kufr then he is a Kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(ii) Applicability on a particular person:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is known at Takfeer-ul-Mu’ayyan It is to impute what is generally stated to be Kufr on a particular person. This can be established only after conditions of Takfeer (imputing Kufr) are met as well as all impediments which may hinder the imputing of Kufr are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(iii) Who Are the Ones who advise on these Enormous Matters?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imputation of Kufr is very serious and it is not left for common Muslims or the student of knowledge to decide. Surely the reliable scholars following the path of the salaf are the ones who can advise concerning these immense issues. So people should refrain and hold themselves so as not to hasten to impute Kufr on a particular person before the evidences are established and impediments are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, Knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Taaghut</strong>: It may be Satan and/or anyone who is worshipped other than Allah and is pleased and/or calls for it. [See Appendix]. Here I relate a very important benefit explaining the issue of Taaghut which is often misunderstood by enthusiastic young Muslims and it is by Shayekh Sulaimaan Ibn Samhaan (rahimahullaah: may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him). He said: “It should be known that the one who seeks judgments from the Taaghut, or rules by other than Allaah’s rule while believing that (these) judgments are more perfect and better than the Judgment of Allaah and His Messenger, then this is disbelief (Kufr ‘aqadi: pertaining to creed) that takes the person out of the fold of Islam-as it is mentioned in the ten nullifiers of Islam. However, as to the one who does not believe as such but resorted to the Taaghut judgment while believing that it to be false, then this is of the practical type of disbelief (Kufr’amali: lesser type that does not take the person from Islam). [See Irshaadut-Taalib Ilaa Ahamadil-Mataalib, p. 19.] In addition, anyone (ruler or ruled) who equates the judgment of Allaah and His Messengers to that of man, or believes that the rules of man are more fitting to our times than the Islamic laws, commits Kufr [See Shayekh bin Baaz’s (rahimahullaah) details on this matter in Qadiyyatu-t-Takfeer bayna ahlis-sunnah wa ffiraqu-d-Dalaal, by Shayekh Sa’eed Ibn Wahf Al-Qahtaani, pp. 72-73.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, therefore, concluded that the term Taaghut in itself does not necessarily translate into major disbelief and apostasy, since every Kufr is Taaghut, but not every Taaghut is Kufr. Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) considered that figurative interpretations of Allaah’s Names and Attributes through scholastic ways, and giving precedence to the intellect over the legal texts as Taaghuts (in as-Sawaa’iq alMursalah, v.2, 632-633). Certainly, none considers every level of these distortions as a major Kufr!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Tawheed</strong>: Belief in Oneness and Uniqueness of Allah. Allah is One in His Lordship, One in His God-ship, and One in His Actions, Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Shirk</strong>: Associating anyone/anything in the worship of Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) or setting up rivals with Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Kufr</strong>: Disbelieving in Allah (subhana wa ta’ala) and His Messengers whether by denial, doubts, suspicion, aversion, jealousy, arrogance or following some whims which deters one from adhering to the Message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are things which nullify Imân (Faith) i.e. Belief, just as there are things which nullify Wudhû&#8217;. If a person does any single one of them, he loses his state of ritual purity. The same is true with Belief. The nullifiers of Belief can be classified into four categories:<i>First category</i>: Denial of Rabb&#8217;s existence or reviling and speaking ill of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Second category</i>: Denial of Allâh&#8217;s right to be worshipped or worshipping anything or anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Third category</i>: Denial of any of Allâh&#8217;s Names or Attributes established in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah or reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourth category</i>: Denial of the role of Muhammed (pbuh) as the messenger of Allâh, or reviling His Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Denial of the existence of Rabb nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first category encompasses several types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Pure atheism; such as the belief of communists who deny that the universe has a creator and say: &#8220;There is no god, and life is a purely material phenomenon.&#8221; They attribute the creation and all actions to pure chance, or &#8220;nature&#8221; but forget the One Who created even the &#8220;chance&#8221; and the &#8220;nature&#8221;, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affaires, Guardian, etc.) over all things.&#8221; (39:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category of disbeliever is more hardened in their apostasy than the polytheist Arabs of post-islamic period, and even Satan himself, as those polytheist Arabs did admit the existence of their creator as the Qur&#8217;ân states about them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: &#8216;Allâh&#8230;'&#8221; (43:87)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Qur&#8217;ân mentions the statement of Satan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(Iblîs) said: I am better then he, You (Allâh) created me from fire, and You created him from clay.&#8221; (38:76)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of disbelief for a Muslim to say, &#8220;Nature created something or that it came into being by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or if a person claims to be the Rabb; as Pharaoh claimed saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I am your lord, most high.&#8221; (79:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or to claim that there are great saints [called &#8220;Qutb&#8221; in Sufi terminology, which literally means axes (of creation)] who have control over what happens in the universe, even if this claim is accompanied with the admissions that Allâh, the Soverign Lord exists. People who have this belief are in a worse condition than the idol worshippers before Islâm, who used to admit that Allâh is the Sole Controller of the affairs of the universe, as is indicated by Allâh&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs? They will say: &#8216;Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh&#8217;s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh?'&#8221; (10:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or the statements of some Sufis that Allâh pervades in His creation, or became incarnate in it. The Sufi, Ibn Arabi, who is buried in Damascus, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord is a slave, and the slave is my Lord. I only wish I knew, which one is the Mukallaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mukallaf is a basic Sharî&#8217;ah terminology, that refers to the essential role of the adult, sane human being: That he or she is charged by Allâh with a series of duties and responsibilities, orders and prohibitions, and he will be questioned on the basis of how well he discharged his responsibilities.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this transgressor of the Sufis has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the dog and the pig is nothing other then our deity, nor is Allâh other then a monk in a church.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Hallâj (a Sufi of Baghdad) stated: &#8220;I am He (i.e. the Rabb) and He is I.&#8221; Due to this statement of his, which he would not retract; the scholars agreed that he should be executed as an apostate. High Exalted is Allâh above what such people say. <b>2. Shirk (polytheism) in Worship nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second category includes the denail of Allâh as the object of worship or ascribing a partner along with Allâh. It too has various manifestations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the trees, Satan or any other created being, and abandon the worship of Allâh, Who created all these things which have no power to benefit nor to harm. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allâh Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.&#8221; (41:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Those who worship Allâh, and worship along with Him some of His creations, such as saints, as embodied in idols, grave-worship, etc. The Arab idol worshippers before Islâm were of this category, as they used to call upon Allâh only in times of hardship and pressing need, and would worship others in times of ease. As the Qur&#8217;ân described them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worships to others.&#8221; (29:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are characterized as Al-Mushrikûn, (i.e. those who associate and attribute partners with Allâh), even though they made supplication to Allâh Alone when they were afraid of drowning at sea, because they didn&#8217;t stay like that. Instead they called upon others after He saved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Since Allâh was displeased with the idol worshipping Arabs before Islam, He branded them as Kâfiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), and ordered His Prophet to fight them, because they called upon others besides Allâh at the time of ease. He didn&#8217;t accept their whole-heartedness when they called upon Him alone in hardship, and He labelled them Mushrikîn. Therefor, what can we say about certain Muslims today, who resort to dead saints at the time of ease as well as at the time of hardship? And they ask of them only Allâh has the power to bestow, like curing the sick, and granting sustance and guidance, etc., and they forget the Creator of those saints, whereas He is the only One Who cures, the Substainer, and the Guide. And those dead people have no power at all and cannot even hear those who are calling upon them, as Allâh stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the datestone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammed pbuh) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and every thing).&#8221; (35:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit to the effect that the dead cannot hear those who call upon them, and explicit in stating that their supplication is major Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them might say: &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that these saints and righteous people have the power to benefit or harm. We only take them as intermediaries who will intercede with Allâh on our behalf, and through them we get closer to Allâh.&#8221; Our reply to them is that the idolaters before Islâm used to hold a similar belief, as is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship besides Allâh things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8216;These are our intercessors with Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?&#8217; Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!&#8221; (10:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving that whoever worships and supplicates other then Allâh, he is a Mushrik even if he believes that those other beings cannot benefit nor harm, but only sees them as intercessors.<br />
Allâh said about the idolaters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those who take Awliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): &#8216;We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.&#8217; Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.&#8221; (39:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving the disbelief of those who call upon other than Allâh with the intention of getting thereby closer to Allâh.<br />
The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Because supplication is worship&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Among the nullifiers of Belief is to rule by other than what Allâh has revealed; if it is accompanied by the belief that Allâh&#8217;s Laws are inappropriate or less appropriate, or that man made laws which contradict them are equally appropriate; Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship non but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221; (12:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfîrun (i.e. disbelievers &#8211; of a lesser degree as they do not act upon Allâh&#8217;s Laws).&#8221; (5:44)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the ruler is applying a law other than what Allah has revealed, while believing that the revealed Law is the only Legitimate Law, but he is contradicting it on the basis of personal whims and inclinations or because of what he considers to be external pressure beyond his control, then he is injust and tyrannical or corrupt, but he did not cross the line of disbelief. This is according to the statement of Ibn Abbas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever repudiates what Allâh has revealed, the he surely disbelieved, while one who accepted it (while acting in contradiction to it), he is unjust and corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the interpretation of the verse chosen by the great exegete Ibn Jarîr At-Tabari, and &#8216;Atâ said with regard to the second state:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A level of disbelief below the level which takes one out of Islâm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who suspended the Laws of Allâh and replaced them with man-made laws which oppose them, believing in the validity of their man-made laws, they have disbelieved and gone out of Islâm by the consensus of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Among the nullifiers of Belief is displeasure with Allâh&#8217;s Legislation, or the opinion that it is too confining and strict or that it imposes undue hardship. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammed pbuh) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221; (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or to dislike the orded which is revealed, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain. That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur&#8217;ân and Islâmic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (47:8,9)</b> 3. Shirk in Allâh&#8217;s Attributes nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third category includes denail of some of all of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes or His Names or speaking ill of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It nullifies Belief when a believer denies the Names of Allâh or His Attributes which are established by the texts of the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic Sunnah; for example, to deny that Allâh&#8217;s Knowledge is total, or His Power, or His Life or His Hearing or Sight or Speech or Mercy, or His Establishment over His Throne or His Transcendence above it, or His Descent to the lowest heaven or that He has a Hand or an Eye, or other than that of the Attributes which befit His Splendour and which do not resemble the attributes of anything in creation. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (42:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse Allâh denied His Resemblance to His creatures, and attributed to Himself the faculties of hearing and sight; and all His other Attributes must be understood in the same way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is an error and misguidance to interpret something some of His affirmed Attributes, and to change the meanings of the words used to describe them from their primary meaning in the Arabic language to obscure meanings, like the interpretation of the word Istawâ which means ascension and establishment above something, to mean Istilâ which means to take power. Imam Al-Bukhâri in his Sahîh transmitted the authentic interpretation of Istawâ from Mujâhid and Abul-&#8216;Âliyah, two of the prominent scholars among the Tabi&#8217;în, the successors of the Sahâbah. The diversionary interpretation of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes leads to their denial. As the interpretation of Istawâ meaning to take power is, in fact, a denial of one of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes, which is Allâh&#8217;s Elevation above His Throne, which is established in numerous places in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).&#8221; (20:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221; (67:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh recorded a Book which is with Him above the Throne.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of interpretation of the Divine Attributes is a form of distortion as Shaikh Muhammed Amîn Shinqeeti states in his book &#8220;Manhaj wa Darâsât feel-Asmâ&#8217;i was-Sifât &#8211; Studies in the (Divine) Names and Attributes&#8221; on page 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To sum up the issue, I would like to make two points. First the interpreter should consider Allâh&#8217;s Statement to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;say Hittatun&#8230;&#8221; (2:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hittatun means repentance, they added a letter &#8220;N&#8221; in it and said &#8220;Hintatun&#8221;, Allâh called this addition a change. Allâh said in Surah Al-Baqarah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh&#8217;s obedience.&#8221; (2:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are those who interpret Allâh&#8217;s Attributes with diversionary interpretation. It was said to them Istawâ so they added an &#8220;L&#8221; and said Istawlâ. Consider the resemblance between the &#8220;L&#8221; they added and the &#8220;N&#8221; the Jews added (this point was originally mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. There are certain Attributes which are exclusive to Allâh, like Knowledge of the unseen, which no one in creation possesses. Allâh said in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), non knows them but He&#8230;&#8221; (6:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh might reveal certain aspects of the unseen to His Messengers through Revelation when He wants, Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to non His Ghaib (unseen) except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes)&#8230;&#8221; (72:26,27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the statements of disbelief and error is the statement of the poet Al-Busairy in Qasîdah Burdah describing the Prophet (pbuh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from your generosity is the world and its rival (that is the Hereafter) and a part of your knowledge is the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This world and the Hereafter are certainly part of the creation of Allâh and from His Generosity, not from the generosity or creation of the Messenger, as the poet claimed.<br />
Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).&#8221; (92:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (pbuh) does not know what is in the Preserved Tablet, nor what the Pen wrote, as the poet claimed, since this is part of the absolute unseen, which no one knows exept Allâh. As the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh.&#8221; (27:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saints, it is only logical that they have less access to knowledge of the absolute unseen as they do not even have access to direct Revelation by which Allâh informed His Prophets and Messengers of certain aspects of the unseen, because Revelation does not descend on saints; it is reserved for Prophets and Messengers, so whoever else claims knowledge of the unseen, and whoever believes their claims, has nullified his belief in Islâm. The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or astrologer and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&#8221; (Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Occasionally the predictions of these fortuntellers do turn out true, but part of that is due to chance, because they are guessing and trying to extrapolate on what they already know. If they were really truthful in their claim to knowledge of the unseen, they would be right all the time, and they would have informed us the secrets of the Jews, and they could have uncovered all the buried treasures of the earth, and they would not be dependent on the people for money, taking their wealth from them under false pretenses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Defamation of Prophets nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This fourth category is the rejection of any of the messengers of Allâh or defaming their characters. These are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To deny the Message of Muhammed (pbuh) because the testimony that &#8216;Muhammed is the Messenger of Allâh&#8217; is one of the pillars of Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To disparage the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) or his truthfulness, or his faithfulness in discharge of what he was entrusted with, or his chasteness or to revile him or make fun of him, or make light of him, or find fault with any of his documented behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To attack his authentic Ahâdîth (transmitted sayings) and disbelieve them, or to reject the true news which he has described for us including his documented prophecies. Examples are the appearance of the Dajjâl (the Antichrist) or the descent of Jesus who will rule by the Sharî&#8217;ah of Muhammed (pbuh) and other prophecies documented in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. It is a nullification of Imân to reject these matters after accepting the attribution of the Ahâdîth to the Prophet (pbuh) as being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To deny any of the Messengers sent by Allâh before Muhammed (pbuh) or to deny the stories and sayings in regards to them and their nations, as reported in the Qur&#8217;ân or by the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) in authentic Ahâdîth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. To claim Prophethood after Muhammed (pbuh) for example Ghulam Ahmed, the Qâdiyâni (i.e. from Qadiyan, India), who claimed Prophethood, while the Qur&#8217;ân says in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammed (pbuh) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the Last (end) of the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (33:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the last one, after whom there will be no Prophet.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anyone who believes that there is a Prophet after Muhammed (pbuh) whether he is a Qâdiyâni (follower of the deviant heretic, Ghulâm Ahmad) or from any other group, he has disbelieved and nullified his Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. To describe the Prophet (pbuh) with attributes which belong to Allâh only, such as unlimited knowledge of the unseen, as some Sufis claim. One of their poets said:<br />
&#8220;Oh (total) knower of the unseen, we resorted to you; Oh curer of the hearts, blessing upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. To supplicate to the Prophet (pbuh) for what only Allâh has the power to bestow, such as supplicating for victory and help, cure of illness, etc., as is happening today among the Muslims, especially among the Sufis as their poet, Al-Busairy said:<br />
&#8220;Whoever asks by the Messenger of Allâh gets victory, even if a lion meets him in the forest;<br />
Never did time impose on me a hardship and I sought his protection except that I got his protection and no harm came to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This conception of the station of the Prophet (pbuh) is Shirk, contradicting the unequivocal announcement of the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And there is no victory except by the help of Allâh&#8230;&#8221; (8:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and contradicting the order of the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When you ask, ask from Allâh, and when you seek help, seek the help from Allâh.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what should we think about those who attribute to &#8220;saints&#8221; knowledge of the unseen, or make a Nadhr (a vow to give charity or perform some other optional good deed) for their sake, or dedicate animal sacrifices to them or ask of them what may only be requested of Allâh, such as sustenance or cure of illness, or victory, etc.? No doubt, these are Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We do not deny the miracles that appeared from the Messengers of Allâh nor those miraculous feets that came from the saints, but what we deny is making them partners with Allâh, supplicating them as we supplicate Allâh, and dedicating sacrifies to them, and undertaking a regime of optional worship for their sake. It has gotten to the point that the graves of some notable &#8220;saints&#8221; are showered with donations which are appropriated by the custodians and servants of these shrines, who then divide them among themselves, consuming people&#8217;s money under false pretenses. At the same time they are surrounded by multitudes of poor people who don&#8217;t get enough to eat for a day.<br />
One poet said: &#8220;Our living don&#8217;t even get a Dhirham (a coin of silver), while thousands and thousands go to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not all of these shrines and graves even contain the body of a saint. But swindlers erect some of them as a means of taking the money of the gullible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, one of my fellow teachers related to me that a certain Sufi Shaikh came to his mother&#8217;s house requesting a donation in order to erect a green flag to indicate the presence of a saint on a certain street, so she gave him some money. He bought some green cloth and fixed it to a wall and started telling people, &#8220;There is a Wali (saint) here, one of the friends of Allâh. I saw him in my dream.&#8221; And thus he started collecting money. One day the government decided to widen that street, which would require removing the grave. The man who had started the whole story started telling people that they had tried to remove it, but the equipment used had broken, and some people believed him, and this rumor started circulating, which caused the government to proceed with caution. The Mufti of that country himself told me that the government called him in the middle of the night to the site of that saint&#8217;s grave. He found it surrounded by soldiers. Then the excavator was brought and the grave was dug up. The Mufti looked inside and found nothing there, and knew the whole thing was a lie and fabrication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, which I heard from a teacher in the Haram in Makkah: One poor man met another and they complained to each other of their poverty. Then they saw a saint&#8217;s grave which was filled with welth. One said to the other: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s dig up a grave and put a saint in it, and the money will start rolling in.&#8221; His friend agreed, so they set out until they came to a braying donkey. They killed it and laid it to rest in a pit, they raised a mausoleum with a dome over it. And then both of them proceeded to roll around in the dust of the grave to get the Barakat (blessing) from it. When people passing by asked them what they were doing they said: &#8220;This is the grave of the saint Hubaish bin Tubaish, who worked miracles which defy description.&#8221; People were taking in by their spell and they began laying donations before the grave as charity and to fulfill vows, until they had gathered great wealth. When they started dividing it, they got into argument and started shouting at each other, which attracted a crowd of spectators. One of the two said: &#8220;I swear to you by this saint I didn&#8217;t take anything from you.&#8221; His friend said: &#8220;You swear to me by this saint while the both of us know there is a donkey in this grave that we buried together?&#8221; The people were astonished and felt foolish due to the donations they had made as vows, and took them back after beating the two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">All praise is due to Allah Alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim should know that Allah (may He be Praised) enjoins all the creation to embrace Islam, hold it firmly and avoid what contradicts it. Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to call for that, informing them that whoever follows him will be guided and whoever turns away from him will be misguided. In many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses), Allah warned people against causes of apostasy and all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and Kufr (disbelief). Under the topic of the rulings of the apostate, scholars (may Allah be merciful with them) mentioned that a Muslim may abandon Islam by committing one of the nullifiers that make his blood and money violable and turn him out of the fold of Islam. <span style="color:#003300;">The most dangerous and common ten nullifiers are mentioned by Shaykh and Imam Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Wahhab and other scholars (may Allah be merciful with them)</span>. Here we will list them in brief so that a Muslim can keep away from them and warn people against them in hope for safety and wellbeing. We will briefly elaborate on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Shirk in the worship of Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills He (Exalted be He) also says: Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers. This includes invoking the dead and seeking relief, vowing or offering sacrifice for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Whoever takes intermediaries between him and Allah, invokes, and asks them for intercession with Allah and puts his trust in them has committed Kufr (disbelief) according to the Ijma` (consensus) of scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is more complete than his guidance or that someone else’s judgment is better than his judgment, such as those who prefer the judgment of the Taghut (false gods) over his judgment, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Whoever hates something that the Messenger (peace be upon him) came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved. Allah (Exalted be He) says: That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur’ân and Islâmic laws, etc.); so He has made their deeds fruitless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s religion, its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Say: &#8220;Was it at Allâh (عز وجل), and His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?&#8221; Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that cause a person to hate or love someone/something. Whoever practices it or is pleased with it commits disbelief. The proof for this is the saying of Allah (Exalted be He): but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, “We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is the saying of Allah (Exalted be He): And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Shari`ah (Islamic law) brought with Muhammad (peace be upon him), then he is a disbeliever. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Turning away from Allah’s religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this statement is the saying of Allah: And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference in committing these nullifiers between the utters them in humor, seriously, or even out of fear except for a person who says them under coercion. All of these (ten) matters are the gravest nullifiers that most often occur. A Muslim must beware of and keep away from these acts. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that entail His anger and severe punishment. May Allah&#8217;s Peace be upon the best of His Creation Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Fourth Nullifier includes those who believe that man-made laws and constitutions are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, equal to it, or that it is permissible to resort to them for judgment even if he believes that the judgment of Shari`ah is better. Likewise, whoever believes that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islam in the twentieth century, that this is a cause for the fall of Muslims, or that it is limited to relationship between the servant and his Lord and should not interfere in the other affairs of life. The fourth category also includes those who hold that carrying out Allah&#8217;s laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era. This category includes those who believe that it is permissible to rule by something other than the Laws of Allah (Shari’ah) in matters of transactions, Hudud (prescribed penalties) and so on, even if he does not believe that it is better than ruling by the Shari`ah. This is because, by doing that, he makes lawful that which Allah forbade, according to the consensus of scholars. Similarly, whoever makes lawful that which Allah has prohibited and this prohibition is indisputably established, such as adultery, Khamr (intoxicant), Riba (usury/interest) and ruling by anything other than the Shari`ah, then he is a disbeliever according to the consensus of Muslim scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all of us to what pleases Him. May Allah guide us and all Muslims to His straight path! He is All-Hearer, Ever Near. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Invalidator Of Islam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hate anything that the Prophet came with are also disbelievers even if they act upon them.<br />
The Qurâan says: &#8220;That is because they hate that which Allah sent down, so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (Soorah 47:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AL-WASAABEE:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh read to us from the book, Explanation of the Nullifiers of Islaam, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah), which was explained (sharh &#8220;Explanation of the Nullifiers of Islaam&#8221;) by Shaykh Abdul Azeez ibn Marzook. The shaykh read to us the following from the aforementioned book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dislikes or hates something which the Prophet (Peace be upon him) came with, from his guidance or his rulings, then verily he has disbelieved in Allaah. And this is from the attributes of the hypocrites. The hypocrites who have nifaaq [hypocrisy] in belief. And this is nifaaq akbar (major hypocrisy) that takes one out of the fold of al-Islaam. A person who has this type of nifaaq, then he is in the lowest part of the hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hates something from the legislation of Allaah and the guidance of the Prophet (Peace be upon him), whether it be his rulings, or his orders, or his forbiddances, or what has come from the Prophet (Peace be upon him) concerning belief; then he has exceeded his bounds, and has exposed himself to a wrath that he cannot bear. And even if one were to work in accordance with and agree to what one hates from the rulings and legislations of Allaah, then this will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who hates the permissibly of having more than one wife in Islaam, and hates this legislation, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, even though he may have more than one wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly is the one who dislikes the legislation of Allaah for the witnessing of two women, which equals the witness of one man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise is the one who he hates certain legislations that have been affirmed through news of the unseen, and believes that they do not agree with the aql (intellect), and that they are not an actuality and a reality. The proofs for this are the verses in Soorah Muhammad (47:8-9). Allaah (subhaana wa taâlaa) has categorized them and made them disbelievers, the reason behind this being that they hate what Allaah has revealed.</p>
