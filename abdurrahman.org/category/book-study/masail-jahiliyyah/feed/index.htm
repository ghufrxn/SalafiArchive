										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab [Died 1206H]<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the classical treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab <b><i>“Masaa’il-ul-Jaahiliyyah”</i></b><i></i> (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance), which is a list of 128 points &#8211; each point representing one aspect of belief or practice that the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon, which Islaam came to oppose. The source used for this translation can be found on sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabic text of the treatise is included within this translation so as to make this e-book a comprehensive reference guide and an easily-accessible study guide. Footnotes were added by the translator in order to clarify and provide evidence for some of the points that the author mentioned but didn’t provide proof or an explanation for. In recent times, this treatise has been explained by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan in several lectures. These lectures were recorded and transcribed and put into a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject matter of this treatise is one of great importance, for the aspects of the Days of Ignorance have not ceased to be acted upon till this very day. And the people that call towards these misguided beliefs and practices of the Days of Ignorance are many, such as innovators and people of desire. So it is important for the Muslim to learn what the People of the Days of Ignorance were upon in terms of beliefs, actions and practices, so that he may avoid that, since Islaam came to oppose these aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> “These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance – both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book – were upon, which the Messenger of Allaah opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarified. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith (Eemaan) in the heart, for what the Messenger of Allaah came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allaah says: <b>‘And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allaah, it is they who are the losers.’</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 52]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[3]</b> They held the acts of opposing the figure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[5]</b> From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allaah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarified this in many places of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[23]</b> They were deluded by the life of this world. So they perceived Allaah’s bestowal of worldly material (on someone), as an indication of He was pleased (with that person), as He says: <b>‘And they say: We are abundant in wealth and in children. And (because of that) we are not going to be punished.’</b> [Surah Saba’: 35]”</p>
