<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army towards the east coast  and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of  three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food  was about to finish. Abu- &#8216;Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was  collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu &#8216;Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration  in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be  one date only.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How could one date benefit you?&#8221; Jabir replied,  &#8220;We came to know its value when even that too finished.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;When  we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate  from it for eighteen days. Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they  were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under  the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the journey food diminished and the people were  reduced to poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their  camels, and he agreed. &#8216;Umar met them and they told him about it, and he said, &#8220;How  would you survive after slaughtering your camels?&#8221; Then he went to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their  camels?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Call upon the people to bring what has  remained of their food.&#8221; A leather sheet was spread and al I the journey food was  collected and heaped over it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and  then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it  till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;I  testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to offer the &#8216;Asr prayer with the Prophet and  slaughter a camel, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would eat the  cooked meat before sunset. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When the people of Ash&#8217;ari tribe  ran short of food during the holy battles, or the food of their families in Medina ran  short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it  among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl. So, these people are from me, and I  am from them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq wrote to him the law of Zakat which  was made obligatory by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He wrote: &#8216;Partners possessing joint property  (sheep) have to pay its Zakat equally. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abaya bin Rafa&#8217;a bin Raft&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather said, &#8220;We were in the company of the  Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as  booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and slaughtered the animals and  put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots  to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as  equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were  exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and  Allah stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Some of these animals are like  wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e.  shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather  said, &#8220;We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the  animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Use whatever causes blood to flow, and  eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not  slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones  (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we  should not imitate for they are infidels).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet decreed that one should not eat two dates  together at a time unless he gets the permission from his companions (sharing the meal  with him). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;While at Medina we were struck with famine. Ibn  Az-Zubair used to provide us with dates as our food. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by us and say,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat two dates together at a time as the Prophet has forbidden eating two dates  together at a time (in a gathering) unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companion  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If one  manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other  shares according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be completely  manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.&#8217; &#8221; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator is  not sure whether the saying &#8221; &#8230; otherwise he will be partially manumitted&#8221; was  said by Nafi&#8217; or the Prophet.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 672: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely  by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him,  then the price of the slave should be estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work  and earn the amount that will manumit him (without overburdening him)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 673: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the  example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats  in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water, they had to  go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, &#8216;Let us make a hole in  our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them.  So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the  people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be  safe.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 674: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he had asked &#8216;Aisha about the meaning of the Statement  of Allah: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan  girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four.&#8221; (4.3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, &#8220;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl  who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him  to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been  given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls  unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were  ordered to marry any other woman.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;After that verse the  people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan &#8216;girls), so Allah revealed  the following verses:&#8211; &#8216;They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah  Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The  orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to  marry&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What is meant by Allah&#8217;s Saying:&#8211; &#8216;And about what is  Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:&#8211; &#8216;If you fear that you shall not Be able  to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.&#8217; (4.3)  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s saying in the other verse:&#8211;&#8216;Yet whom you desire to marry&#8217;  (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision  when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The  guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty  without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are  neither beautiful nor wealthy).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand.  He said, &#8220;I and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on  credit.&#8221; Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He replied, &#8220;I  and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went to the Prophet and asked him  about it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his mother Zainab bint Humaid took him to the Prophet  and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take the pledge of allegiance from him.&#8221; But he  said, &#8220;He is still too young for the pledge,&#8221; and passed his hand on his (i.e.  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) head and invoked for Allah&#8217;s blessing for him. Zuhra bin Ma&#8217;bad stated that  he used to go with his grandfather, &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff.  Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, &#8220;Be our partner, as the  Prophet invoked Allah to bless you.&#8221; So, he would be their partner, and very often he  would win a camel&#8217;s load and send it home. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share o a  jointly possessed slave, it is imperative on him to manumit the slave completely if he has  sufficient money to pay the rest of its price which is to be estimated justly.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has  sufficient money. Otherwise he should look for some work for the slave (to earn what would  enable him to emancipate himself), without overburdening him with work.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in  the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived  at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra and that  we could finish our Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual  intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, &#8220;Shall we  go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?&#8221; Jabir moved his hand while  saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;I have  been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you  do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have  brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have  finished the Ihram.&#8221; At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?&#8221; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;It is forever.&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was  saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, &#8216;Ali was  saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s). The Prophet told him to keep on the  Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 684: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;We were in the  valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and  sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat  in the pots and started cooking. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots,  and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels  fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and)  a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Some of these  animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then  you should treat it as you have done now.&#8217; &#8221; My grandfather said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we  slaughter the animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, or you can use what  would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of  Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don&#8217;t use teeth or fingernails (in  slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used  by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When an adulterer commits illegal sexual intercourse, then he is not a believer at the time, he is doing it, and when a drinker of an alcoholic liquor drinks it, then he is not a believer at the time of drinking it, and when a thief steals, then he is not a believer at the time of stealing, and when a robber robs, and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing robbery.</p>

The Prophet collected the shattered pieces and put the food back in it and said, &#8220;Eat.&#8221; He kept the servant and the bowl till he had eaten the food.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There was an Israeli man called Juraij, while he was praying, his mother came and called him, but he did not respond to her call. He said (to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and called him and said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8221; Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; &#8220;O boy! Who is your father?&#8221; The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to  the Prophet (and informed him about it), he said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it  for one year&#8221; I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it, so I again went to the  Prophet who said, &#8220;Make public announcement for another year.&#8221; I did, but none  turned up to claim it. I went to him for the third time and he said, &#8220;Keep the  container and the string which is used for its tying and count the money it contains and  if its owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub-narrator Salama said, &#8220;I met him (Suwaid,  another sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know whether Ubai made the  announcement for three years or just one year.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking  up a lost thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year.  Remember the description of its container and the string with which it is tied; and if  somebody comes and claims it and describes it correctly, (give it to him); otherwise,  utilize it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the  wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; On that the face of the  Prophet became red (with anger) and said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it, as it has  its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat trees.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Yazid Maula Al-Munba&#8217;ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham  saying, &#8220;The Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, &#8216;Remember the description of  its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly for one year.&#8217;  &#8221; Yazid added, &#8220;If nobody claims then the person who has found it can spend it,  and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to him.&#8221; Yahya said, &#8220;I do not know  whether the last sentences were said by the Prophet or by Yazid.&#8221; Zaid further said,  &#8220;The Prophet was asked, &#8216;What about a lost sheep?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Take it, for it  is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf.&#8221; Yazid added that it  should also be announced publicly. The man then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The  Prophet said, &#8220;Leave it, as it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will  reach a place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came and asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about picking a lost  thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Remember the description of its container and the string it  is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one year. If the owner shows up,  give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with it.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;What  about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e.  its owner), or for the wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;It is none of your concern. It has its water-container (reservoir)  and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat the trees till its owner finds  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have  eaten it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Sometimes  when I return home and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but  I fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 613: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of  Mecca, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, said,  &#8220;Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority to His Apostle and  the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for anyone before me, and was made legal  for me for a part of a day, and it will not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should  not be chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its fallen things  is not allowed except for one who makes public announcement for it, and he whose relative  is murdered has the option either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate.&#8221;  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir.&#8221; Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get it written for me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Write it for Abu Shah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator asked Al-Auza&#8217;i): What did he mean by  saying, &#8220;Get it written, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The speech which  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;An animal should not be milked  without the permission of its owner. Does any of you like that somebody comes to his store  and breaks his container and takes away his food? The udders of the animals are the stores  of their owners where their provision is kept, so nobody should milk the animals of  somebody else, without the permission of its owner.&#8221; </font></p>

He said,  &#8220;Make public announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its  container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if its owner comes back  after that, give it to him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a  lost sheep?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Take it, for it is for you, for your  brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost  camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said,  &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its  owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

One of them told me to drop it but I refused  to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found him, otherwise I would  utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin  Ka&#8217;b about it. He said, &#8220;I found a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of  the Prophet and took it to the Prophet who said to me, &#8216;Make public announcement about it  for one year.&#8217; So, I announced it for one year and went to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Announce  it publicly for another year.&#8217; So, I announced it for another year. I went to him again  and he said, &#8220;Announce for an other year.&#8221; So I announced for still another  year. I went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, &#8216;Remember the amount of  money, the description of its container and the string it is tied with, and if the owner  comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was on my way, all of a sudden I saw a shepherd  driving his sheep, I asked him whose servant he was. He replied that he was the servant of  a man from Quraish, and then he mentioned his name and I recognized him. I asked, &#8220;Do  your sheep have some milk?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8220;Are you  going to milk for me?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I ordered him and he tied the  legs of one of the sheep. Then I told him to clean the udder (teats) of dust and to remove  dust off his hands. He removed the dust off his hands by clapping his hands. He then  milked a little milk. I put the milk for Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a pot and closed its mouth  with a piece of cloth and poured water over it till it became cold. I took it to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He drank it till I was pleased. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes the money of the  people with the intention of repaying it, Allah will repay it on his behalf, and whoever  takes it in order to spoil it, then Allah will spoil him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the  mountain of Uhud and said, &#8220;I would not like to have this mountain turned into gold  for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me for more than  three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Allah&#8217;s Cause), except that Dinar which I will  keep for repaying debts.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Those who are rich in this world would  have little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in  Allah&#8217;s Cause), and they are few in number.&#8221; Then he ordered me to stay at my place  and went not far away. I heard a voice and intended to go to him but I remembered his  order, &#8220;Stay at your place till I return.&#8221; On his return I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! (What was) that noise which I heard?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you hear  anything?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Gabriel came and said to me,  &#8216;Whoever amongst your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter  Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even if he stole  or committed illegal sexual intercourse)&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I had gold equal to the  mountain of Uhud, it would not please me that it should remain with me for more than three  days, except an amount which I would keep for repaying debts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man demanded his debts from Allah&#8217;s Apostle in such a  rude manner that the companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but the Prophet said,  &#8220;Leave him, no doubt, for he (the creditor) has the right to demand it (harshly). Buy  a camel and give it to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The camel that is available is older  than the camel he demands. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;Buy it and give it to him, for  the best among you are those who repay their debts handsomely. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Once a man died and was  asked, &#8216;What did you use to say (or do) (in your life time)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I was a  business-man and used to give time to the rich to repay his debt and (used to) deduct part  of the debt of the poor.&#8217; So he was forgiven (his sins.)&#8221; Abu Masud said, &#8220;I  heard the same (Hadith) from the Prophet.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud,  and he was in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to the  Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the fruits of my garden and  exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give  them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early  in the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I  then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for  us. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates).  I requested him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to the Jew and asked him to accept  the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered  the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying),  &#8220;Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due.&#8221; So, I plucked the fruits for him  after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen  Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to inform of what had  happened, but found him praying the &#8216;Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the  extra fruits which remained. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me to inform (Umar) Ibn Al-Khatab about  it. When I went to &#8216;Umar and told him about it, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle  walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died, he left behind children  and debts. I asked the lenders to put down some of his debt, but they refused, so I went  to the Prophet to intercede with them, yet they refused. The Prophet said (to me),  &#8220;Classify your dates into their different kinds: &#8216;Adhq bin Zaid, Lean and &#8216;Ajwa, each  kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you.&#8221; I did so and the  Prophet came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid  them fully, and the amount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched  them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among  with the Prophet and I was riding one of our camels. The camel got tired and was lagging  behind the others. The Prophet hit it on its back. He said, &#8220;Sell it to me, and you  have the right to ride it till Medina.&#8221; When we approached Medina, I took the permission  from the Prophet to go to my house, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have newly  married.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or  divorcee)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have married a matron, as &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died and  left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a matron who may teach them and  bring them up with good manners.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to me), &#8220;Go to your  family.&#8221; When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling of the camel,  he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and about  what the Prophet had done to the camel and his hitting it. When the Prophet arrived, I  went to him with the camel in the morning and he gave me its price, the camel itself, and  my share from the war booty as he gave the other people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a blacksmith In the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance,  and &#8216;Asi bin Wail owed me some money. I went to him to demand it, but he said to me,  &#8220;I will not pay you unless you reject faith in Muhammad.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;By  Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let you die and then resurrect  you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then wait till I die and come to life again, for then I will be  given property and offspring and will pay your right.&#8221; So, thus revelation came:  &#8220;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and yet says, &#8216;I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; &#8221; (19.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it  turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I  have been created for sloughing.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the  shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when  there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said,  &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221; (It has been written that a wolf  also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in  Fatah-al-Bari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was  amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its  tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be  busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has  provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have  never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There  is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those  palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said,  &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced  Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said to the Prophet &#8220;Distribute the date  palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The  Ansar said (to the emigrants), &#8220;Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share  the fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We listen and obey.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 519: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of  Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin  Thabit said in a poetic verse: &#8220;The chiefs of Bani Lu&#8217;ai found it easy to watch fire  spreading at Al-Buwaira.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 520: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the  landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the  rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold  or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get  so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both  spend on it and the yield is divided between them.&#8221; Az-Zuhri had the same opinion.  Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half  the yield.&#8221; Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, &#8216;Ata&#8217;, Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said,  &#8220;There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis  that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver  for his labor.&#8221; Ma&#8217;am said, &#8220;There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite  (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the  animals is given to the owner of the animals.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 521: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar  to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would  be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of  dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When &#8216;Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the  Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the  previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and &#8216;Aisha chose  the land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that  they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 523: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Tawus, &#8220;I wish you would give up Mukhabara  (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it.&#8221; On that Tawus  replied, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most  learned man, namely Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, &#8216;It  is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one&#8217;s brother than to charge him a  fixed rental.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land and say to the owner, &#8220;The yield of this portion is for us and  the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent).&#8221; One of those portions might  yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 526: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three men were walking, It  started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled  down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other,  &#8220;Think of good deeds which you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving  reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you.&#8221; One of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On  my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my  parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and  found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated  to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children  were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this  for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.&#8217; So,  Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I was  in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted  to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I  struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).&#8217; So, I  got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted  a little more. Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice  and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused  to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from  the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, &#8216;Fear Allah (and give me my  right).&#8221; I said, &#8216;Go and take those cows and the shepherd.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Be afraid of  Allah! Don&#8217;t mock at me.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).&#8217; So, he took  all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.&#8217;  So, Allah removed the rock.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of  rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said  to him, &#8220;You are in a blessed valley.&#8221; Musa said, &#8220;Salim let our camels  kneel at the place where &#8216;Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the  bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in Al-&#8216;Aqiq he said, &#8220;Someone  (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, &#8216;Offer the  prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj  (together).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land  became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to  expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they  would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told them, &#8220;We will  let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.&#8221; So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on  living there until &#8216;Umar forced them to go towards Taima&#8217; and Ariha&#8217;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Zuhair said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade us to  do a thing which was a source of help to us.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said was right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me and asked, &#8216;What are you  doing with your farms?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the  yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for  some Wasqs of barley and dates.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not do so, but cultivate (the  land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;We hear and obey.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to rent their land for cultivation for  one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it  uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever  has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise  he should keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi &#8216;bin  Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, &#8220;It is permissible to rent the land for  cultivation, for Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had  better give the land to one&#8217;s brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr,  &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi  &#8216;bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar went to Rafi&#8217;  and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the  renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You know that we used to rent our farms in the  life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and  for certain amount of figs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I knew that the land was  rented for cultivation in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Later on Ibn &#8216;Umar was  afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up  renting his land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;My two uncles told me that they  (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet  for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield  stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it.&#8221; I said to Rafi,  &#8220;What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There is  no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, &#8220;If those who have discernment  for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden  concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin  was sitting with him. &#8220;One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him  to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, &#8216;Are you not living in the pleasures you like?&#8217;  He will say, &#8216;Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;When  the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get  ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.  Allah will then say to him, &#8216;O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing  satisfies you.&#8217; &#8221; On that, the bedouin said, &#8220;The man must be either from  Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not  farmers.&#8221; The Prophet smiled (at this). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 539: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to  cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water  streams, and cook them in a pot of her&#8217;s, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya&#8217;qub,  the sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain  fat or melted fat (taken from meat).&#8221;) When we offered the Friday prayer we would go  to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of  that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e.  Friday prayer) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 540: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many  narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, &#8220;Why  do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?&#8221; In fact, my emigrant brethren  were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I  was a poor man keeping the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled  my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were  absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it  on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement.&#8221; So, I spread my covering  sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I  gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle) with the truth,  since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of  mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah&#8217;s Book, I would never have related any  narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): &#8220;Verily! Those who conceal the  clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down &#8230;..(up to) the Merciful.&#8217;  (2.159-160) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The honest treasurer who gives  willingly what he is ordered to give, is one of the two charitable persons, (the second  being the owner).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 462: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet with two men from Ash-ari tribe. I  said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I do not know that they want employment.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, we do not appoint for our jobs anybody who demands it earnestly.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.036.463"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 463: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah did not send any prophet but  shepherded sheep.&#8221; His companions asked him, &#8220;Did you do the same?&#8221; The  Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, I used to shepherd the sheep of the people of Mecca for some  Qirats.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.036.464"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 464: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the  tribe of Bani Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abu bin &#8216;Adi as a guide. He was an expert  guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by with the tribe of Al-&#8216;Asi  bin Wail and he was on the religion of Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had  confidence in him and gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave  of Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels after three days  and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out accompanied by &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira and  the Dili guide who guided them below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 465: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr  hired a man from the tribe of Bani-Ad-Dil as an expert guide who was a pagan (follower of  the religion of the pagans of Quraish). The Prophet and Abu Bakr gave him their two riding  camels and took a promise from him to bring their riding camels in the morning of the  third day to the Cave of Thaur. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 466: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ya&#8217;la bin Umaya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the  Prophet and in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who  quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other&#8217;s finger and caused his  own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet  cancelled the suit and said to the complainant, &#8220;Did you expect him to let his finger  in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Juraij from Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from his  grandfather a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own tooth to  fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for compensation (for the broken  tooth). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 467: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Both of them (Moses and  Al-Khadir) proceeded on till they reached a wall which was about to fall.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d said,  &#8220;(Al-Khadir pointed) with his hands (towards the wall) and then raised his hands and  the wall became straightened up.&#8221; Ya&#8217;la said, &#8220;I think Said said, &#8216;He (Khadir)  passed his hand over it and it was straightened up.&#8221; (Moses said to him), &#8220;if  you had wanted, you could have taken wages for it.&#8221; Said said, &#8220;Wages with which  to buy food . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 468: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Your example and the example of the  people of the two Scriptures (i.e. Jews and Christians) is like the example of a man who  employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work for me from morning till midday for  one Qirat?&#8217; The Jews accepted and carried out the work. He then asked, Who will work for  me from midday up to the &#8216;Asr prayer for one Qirat?&#8217; The Christians accepted and fulfilled  the work. He then said, &#8216;Who will work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset for two Qirats?&#8217;  You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;Why  should we work more and get lesser wages?&#8217; (Allah) said, &#8216;Have I with-held part of your  right?&#8217; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;It is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever  I wish .&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your example and the example of  Jews and Christians is like the example of a man who employed some laborers to whom he  said, &#8216;Who will work for me up to midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews carried out the  work for one Qirat each; and then the Christians carried out the work up to the &#8216;Asr  prayer for one Qirat each; and now you Muslims are working from the &#8216;Asr prayer up to  sunset for two Qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We work more and  are paid less.&#8217; The employer (Allah) asked them, &#8216;Have I usurped some of your right?&#8217; They  replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;That is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I wish.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 470: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;I will be an opponent  to three types of people on the Day of Resurrection: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but proves  treacherous; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. One who sells a free person and eats his price; and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. One who employs a laborer and takes full work from him  but does not pay him for his lab our.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.036.471"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 471: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of Muslims, Jews and  Christians is like the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning  till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and then said, &#8216;We do not need your  money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be annulled.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Don&#8217;t quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.&#8217; But  they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them,  &#8216;Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first  batch.&#8217; So, they worked till the time of &#8216;Asr prayer. Then they said, &#8220;Let what we  have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,&#8217; but they  refused. Thereafter he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they  worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two  former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the example of this  light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 472: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Three men from among  those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered  it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to  each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda  to the righteous deed which you have done (for Allah&#8217;s sake only).&#8217; So, one of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk  before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had  slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I  disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of  milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then  they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve  us from our critical situation caused by this rock.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little but  they could not get out.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I  had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations  with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me  and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my  desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for  you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have  sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to  me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only,  please relieve us from the present calamity.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little more but still  they could not get out from there.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah!  I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did  not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby.  (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah&#8217;s slave! Pay me my wages. I said to  him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah&#8217;s slave!  Don&#8217;t mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them  away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from  the present suffering.&#8217; So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 473: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu May&#8217; id Al-Ansari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to give in charity we  would go to the market and work as porters to earn a Mudd (two hand-fulls) (of foodstuff)  but now some of us have one-hundred thousand Dirhams or Diners. (The sub-narrator) Shaqiq  said, &#8220;I think Abu Mas&#8217;ud meant himself by saying (some of us) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Tawus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The Prophet forbade the meeting of  caravans (on the way) and ordained that no townsman is permitted to sell things on behalf  of a bedouin.&#8221; I asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;What is the meaning of his saying, &#8216;No  townsman is permitted to sell things on behalf of a bedouin.&#8217; &#8221; He replied, &#8220;He  should not work as a broker for him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 475: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khabbab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a blacksmith and did some work for Al-&#8216;As bin Wail.  When he owed me some money for my work, I went to him to ask for that amount. He said,  &#8220;I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah!  I will never do that till you die and be resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Will I be dead  and then resurrected after my death?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There I  will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due.&#8221; Then Allah  revealed. &#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; (19.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 476: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey  till they reached some of the &#8216;Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them  as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or  stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said  (to the others), &#8220;Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided  here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment),&#8221;  They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;Our chief has  been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has  not benefitted. Have you got anything (useful)?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by  Allah! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will  not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it.&#8221; They agrees to  pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): &#8216;All the  praises are for the Lord of the Worlds&#8217; and puffed over the chief who became all right as  if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of  sickness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e.  the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who  performed the recitation said, &#8220;Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and  narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order.&#8221; So, they went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and narrated the story. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;How did you come to know that  Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;You have done the right  thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.&#8221; The Prophet  smiled thereupon. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came to Medina and the people used to pay in  advance the prices of fruits to be delivered within two to three years.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I  used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be  present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my  Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of  Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle once said, &#8220;Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present  speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say.&#8221; So, I  spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his  saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, &#8220;When we came to Medina as  emigrants, Allah&#8217;s Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad bin  Ar-Rabi&#8217;. Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; said (to me), &#8216;I am the richest among the Ansar, so I will give  you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may  choose I will divorce her, and when she has completed the prescribed period (before  marriage) you may marry her.&#8217; Abdur-Rahman replied, &#8220;I am not in need of all that. Is  there any market-place where trade is practiced?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;The market of  Qainuqa.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day and brought some dried  butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he continued going there regularly. Few days  later, &#8216;AbdurRahman came having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked him whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said,  &#8216;Whom have you married?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;A woman from the Ansar.&#8217; Then the Prophet asked,  &#8216;How much did you pay her?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a  date stone (or a date stone of gold)! The Prophet said, &#8216;Give a Walima (wedding banquet)  even if with one sheep .&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina, the Prophet  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi al-Ansari. Sad was a  rich man, so he said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I will give you half of my property and will  help you marry.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in your  family and property. Show me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman did not return from the  market) till he gained some dried buttermilk (yoghurt) and butter (through trading). He  brought that to his house-hold. We stayed for some-time (or as long as Allah wished), and  then Abdur-Rahman came, scented with yellowish perfume. The Prophet said (to him)  &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married to an Ansari woman.&#8221; The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What did you pay her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;A gold stone or gold  equal to the weight of a date stone.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Give a wedding  banquet even if with one sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ukaz, Majanna and Dhul-Majaz were market-places in the  Pre-lslamic period of ignorance. When Islam came, Muslims felt that marketing there might  be a sin. So, the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;There is no harm for you to seek the  bounty of your Lord (in the seasons of Hajj).&#8221; (2.198) Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited the Verse  in this way. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;Both legal and illegal things are  obvious, and in between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So who-ever forsakes those  doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid what is clearly illegal;  and who-ever indulges in these (suspicious) doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit  what is clearly illegal. Sins are Allah&#8217;s Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures  (his sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abu Waqqas took a firm promise from his brother  Sad bin Abu Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody as he was  his (i.e. &#8216;Utba&#8217;s) son. In the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad bin Abu Waqqas took  him, and said that he was his brother&#8217;s son, and his brother took a promise from him to  that effect. &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said, &#8220;He is my brother and the son of the  slave-girl of my father and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Then they both went to the  Prophet Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is the son of my brother and he has taken a  promise from me that I will take him.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;(He is) my brother  and the son of my father&#8217;s slave-girl and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;The boy is for you. O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;The son is for the bed (i.e the man on whose bed he was born) and stones  (disappointment and deprivation) for the one who has done illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet told his wife Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to screen herself from that  boy as he noticed a similarity between the boy and &#8216;Utba. So, the boy did not see her till  he died. </font></p>

I release my dog by the name of Allah and find with it at the game, another dog  on which I have not mentioned the name of Allah, and I do not know which one of them  caught the game.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to him), &#8216;Don&#8217;t eat it as you have mentioned  the name of Allah on your dog and not on the other dog.&#8221; </font></p>

He said (to me), &#8220;I will not  pay you unless you disbelieve Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I will not disbelieve till  Allah kills you and then you get resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Leave me till I die and  get resurrected, then I will be given wealth and children and I will pay you your  debt.&#8221; On that occasion it was revealed to the Prophet: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and says:  Surely I will be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen, or has he taken a  covenant from the Beneficent (Allah)? (19.77-78) </font></p>

One of us said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give it to me to wear.&#8217; The Prophet  agreed to give it to him. The Prophet sat with the people for a while and then returned  (home), wrapped that waist sheet and sent it to him. The people said to that man, &#8216;You  haven&#8217;t done well by asking him for it when you know that he never turns down anybody&#8217;s  request.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;By Allah, I have not asked him for it except to use it as my  shroud when I die.&#8221; Sahl added; &#8220;Later it (i.e. that sheet) was his  shroud.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was with the Prophet in a Ghazwa (Military Expedition)  and my camel was slow and exhausted. The Prophet came up to me and said, &#8220;O  Jabir.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes?&#8221; He said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;My camel is slow and tired, so I am left behind.&#8221; So, he got down  and poked the camel with his stick and then ordered me to ride. I rode the camel and it  became so fast that I had to hold it from going ahead of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He then asked  me, have you got married?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He asked, &#8220;A virgin or  a matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I married a matron.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why  have you not married a virgin, so that you may play with her and she may play with  you?&#8221; Jabir replied, &#8220;I have sisters (young in age) so I liked to marry a matron  who could collect them all and comb their hair and look after them.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;You will reach, so when you have arrived (at home), I advise you to associate  with your wife (that you may have an intelligent son).&#8221; Then he asked me, &#8220;Would  you like to sell your camel?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative and the Prophet purchased  it for one Uqiya of gold. Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached before me and I reached in the morning,  and when I went to the mosque, I found him at the door of the mosque. He asked me,  &#8220;Have you arrived just now?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;Leave  your camel and come into (the mosque) and pray two Rakat.&#8221; I entered and offered the  prayer. He told Bilal to weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold. So Bilal weighed for me  fairly and I went away. The Prophet sent for me and I thought that he would return to me  my camel which I hated more than anything else. But the Prophet said to me, &#8220;Take  your camel as well as its price.&#8221; </font></p>

We have sent you as a witness (for  Allah&#8217;s True religion) And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a  warner (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My  messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you &#8220;Al-Mutawakkil&#8221; (who depends upon  Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a noise-maker in the markets And you do  not do evil to those Who do evil to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and  kindness. Allah will not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked  people by making them say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; With  which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and enveloped hearts.&#8221; </font></p>

She returned, and at that time,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting (present). Buraira said, &#8216;I told them of the offer but they  did not accept it and insisted on having the Wala.&#8217;.&#8217; The Prophet heard that.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  narrated the whole story to the Prophet . He said to her, &#8220;Buy her and stipulate that  her Wala&#8217; would be yours as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha did so. Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up in front of the people, and after glorifying Allah he said,  &#8220;Amma Badu (i.e. then after)! What about the people who impose conditions which are  not in Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws)? Any condition that is not in Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws) is invalid  even if they were one hundred conditions, for Allah&#8217;s decisions are the right ones and His  conditions are the strong ones (firmer) and the Wala&#8217; will be for the manumitted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was with the Prophet while he was eating spadix. He said,  &#8220;From the trees there is a tree which resembles a faithful believer.&#8221; I wanted  to say that it was the date palm, but I was the youngest among them (so I kept quiet). He  added, &#8220;It is the date palm.&#8221; Shuraih told the weavers, &#8220;You are permitted  to follow your own conventions to solve your problems (it is legal for you to stick to  your traditions in bargain) . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Hasan hired a donkey from &#8216;Abdullah bin Mirdas and asked  him about the hire. The latter replied that it was for two Daniqs (a Daniq equals 116th  Dirham). So Al-Hasan rode away. Another time, Al-Hasan came to &#8216;Abdullah bin Mirdas and  asked him to hire the donkey to him and rode away without asking him about the hire, but  he sent him half a Dirham. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three persons were walking,  rain began to fall and they had to enter a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled over and  blocked the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, &#8216;Invoke Allah with the best deed  you have performed (so Allah might remove the rock)&#8217;. One of them said, &#8216;O Allah! My  parents were old and I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk  (the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. After they had drunk  from it, I would give it to my children, family and wife. One day I was delayed and on my  return I found my parents sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were  crying at my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it was dawn. O  Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then please remove this rock so that we  may see the sky.&#8217; So, the rock was moved a bit. The second said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I  was in love with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a woman, and  she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars  (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat  in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her  except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I  did if for Your sake, kindly remove this rock.&#8217; So, two-thirds of the rock was removed.  Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one  Faraq (three Sa&#8217;s) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I  sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a shepherd. After a time that man came and  demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for  they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I was not  joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You regard that I did it  sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So, the rock was removed completely  from the mouth of the cave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Prophet Abraham emigrated with  Sarah and entered a village where there was a king or a tyrant. (The king) was told that  Abraham had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming  women. So, the king sent for Abraham and asked, &#8216;O Abraham! Who is this lady accompanying  you?&#8217; Abraham replied, &#8216;She is my sister (i.e. in religion).&#8217; Then Abraham returned to her  and said, &#8216;Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my  sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.&#8217; Then Abraham  sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed  and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private  parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217;  On that the king fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the  condition of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I  have killed him.&#8217; The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up  again and performed ablution, prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and  Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please  do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217; The king again fell in a mood of agitation and  started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he  should die, the people will say that I have killed him.&#8217; The king got either two or three  attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, &#8216;By Allah! You have sent a  satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.&#8217; So she came back to Abraham and said,  &#8216;Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a slavegirl for service.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 33:</p>
<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221; So, he performed Itikaf for one night.</p>
<hr>

<h3 align="center">Praying at Night in Ramadaan (Taraweeh)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.032.226"></a>Volume 3, Book 32, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying regarding Ramadan, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night in it (the month of Ramadan) out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221; Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s Caliphate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abdul Qari said, &#8220;I went out in the company of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)&#8217;. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, &#8216;Umar remarked, &#8216;What an excellent Bid&#8217;a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.&#8217; He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray (at night) in Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was informed by &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;How was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in Ramadan?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat &#8212;- let alone their beauty and length&#8212;-and then he would pray four &#8212;-let alone their beauty and length &#8212;-and then he would pray three Rakat (Witr).&#8221; She added, &#8220;I asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the Witr?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever fasted the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith (i.e. belief) and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven .&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some men amongst the companions of the Prophet were shown in their dreams that the night of Qadr was in the last seven nights of Ramadan. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It seems that all your dreams agree that (the Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to search for it (i.e. the Night of Qadr) should search in the last seven (nights of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Sa&#8217;id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, &#8220;We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, &#8216;I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l&#8217;tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day&#8217;s period)&#8217;, and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Search for the Night of Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque) in the middle third of Ramadan and after passing the twenty nights he used to go back to his house on the 21st, and the people who were in Itikaf with him also used to go back to their houses. Once in Ramadan, in which he practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, &#8220;I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet . I saw with my own eyes the Prophet at the completion of the morning prayer leaving with his face covered with mud and water.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Night of Qadr is in the last ten nights of the month (Ramadan), either on the first nine or in the last (remaining) seven nights (of Ramadan).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added, &#8220;Search for it on the twenty-fourth (of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came out to inform us about the Night of Qadr but two Muslims were quarreling with each other. So, the Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramadan).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, the Prophet used to tighten his waist belt (i.e. work hard) and used to pray all the night, and used to keep his family awake for the prayers.</p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi: Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah told him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah) if he had sta</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle and a woman from the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl&#8217;s face to the other side. The woman said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, you may.&#8221; That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).</p>

Go along with your sister and let her perform &#8216;Umra from Tan&#8217;im.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman made her ride over the pack-saddle of a she-camel and she performed &#8216;Umra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was asked, &#8220;Which is the best deed?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To believe in Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; He was then asked, &#8220;Which is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To participate in Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; He was then asked, &#8220;Which is the next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To perform Hajj-Mabrur. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the mother of the faithful believers) I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The best Jihad (for women) is Hajj Mabrur. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj for Allah&#8217;s pleasure and does not have sexual relations with his wife, and does not do evil or sins then he will return (after Hajj free from all sins) as if he were born anew.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 597:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to visit &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar at his house which contained many tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for Umra. He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 598:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Yemen used to come for Hajj and used not to bring enough provisions with them and used to say that they depend on Allah. On their arrival in Medina they used to beg the people, and so Allah revealed, &#8220;And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the fear of Allah.&#8221; (2.197).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 599:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) made Dhul-Huiaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 600:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The people of Medina should assume lhram from Dhul-Hulaifa; the people of Sham from Al-Juhfa; and the people of Najd from Qarn.&#8221; And &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;I was informed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said, &#8216;The people of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 601:</p>

So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The Miqat for the people of Medina is Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;They claim, but I did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, &#8220;The Miqat for the people of Yemen is Yalamlam.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 604:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, and Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqlt are for those living at those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is living inside these places can assume lhram from his own dwelling place, and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 606:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these two towns (Basra and Kufa) were captured, the people went to &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O the Chief of the faithful believers! The Prophet fixed Qarn as the Miqat for the people of Najd, it is beyond our way and it is difficult for us to pass through it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take as your Miqat a place situated opposite to Qarn on your usual way. So, he fixed Dhatu-Irq (as their Miqat).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida&#8217;, where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&#8217;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &#8216;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with &#8216;Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both.&#8221; I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, &#8220;Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra.&#8221; So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan&#8217;im. So I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;This &#8216;Umra is instead of your missed one.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, &#8216;Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted &#8216;Umra.&#8217; So I told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, &#8216;This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.&#8217; &#8221; I (Shu&#8217;ba) asked, &#8220;Why (did he invite you)?&#8221; He (Abu Jamra) said, &#8220;Because of the dream which I had seen.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, &#8220;A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel.&#8221; Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah&#8217;s Statement: &#8220;Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah&#8217;s Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.&#8221; (8.72)</p>

My mother (Asma&#8217;) told me that she, her sister (&#8216;Aisha), Az-Zubair and such and such persons assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and after they passed their hands over the Black Stone Corner (of the Ka&#8217;ba) they finished the Ihram.

When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said, &#8220;This is in lieu of your missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina.

He (the son of Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba. I suggest that you should stay here.&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka&#8217;ba, I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done . . . &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After arriving at Mecca, Ibn &#8216;Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;There is a danger of an impending war between them.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The ceremonies of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and &#8216;Umra. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

(The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka&#8217;ba, or performs &#8216;Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; &#8221; (2.158)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn &#8216;Umar).

The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.&#8217; &#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada&#8217;) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he performed &#8216;Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did.</p>

Then he went out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra (together) and said, &#8220;The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and &#8216;Umra are the same.&#8221; He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered to us a sermon on the Day of Nahr. He said, &#8220;Do you know what is the day today?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give that day another name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the Day of Nahr?&#8221; We said, &#8220;It is.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We replied: &#8220;Yes! It is.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What town is this?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes. It is.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No doubt, your blood and your properties are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours, till the day you meet your Lord. No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you? They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are absent because the informed one might comprehend it (what I have said) better than the present audience, who will convey it to him. Beware! Do not renegade (as) disbelievers after me by striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;: </p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar  used to give dates (as Sadaqat-ulFitr). Once there was scarcity of dates in Medina and Ibn  &#8216;Umar gave barley. &#8216;And Ibn &#8216;Umar used to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr for every young and old  person. He even used to give on behalf of my children. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to give  Sadaqatul-Fitr to those who had been officially appointed for its collection. People used  to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (even) a day or two before the &#8216;Id. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.484">Volume 2, Book 24, Number 484: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah , </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet for offering  prayer perfectly giving Zakat and giving good advice to every Muslim. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 485: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;(On the Day of Resurrection) camels  will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the world),  and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they would tread him with their  feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their owner in the best state of health they have  ever had in the world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with  their hooves and would butt him with their horns.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;One of  their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection,  carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, &#8216;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help you, for I conveyed  Allah&#8217;s Message to you.&#8217; Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying  over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say &#8220;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me).&#8221; I will say to him, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help you for I  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 486: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever is made wealthy by  Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his wealth  will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes.  The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say, &#8216;I am your wealth, I am your  treasure.&#8217; &#8221; Then the Prophet recited the holy verses:&#8211; &#8216;Let not those who withhold  . . .&#8217; (to the end of the verse). (3.180). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 487: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;No Zakat is due on  property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than  five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs.&#8221; (A Wasqs equals 60 Sa&#8217;s)  &amp; (1 Sa=3 K gms App.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 488: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met  Abu Dhar and asked him, &#8220;What has brought you to this place?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the  Quran): &#8216;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.&#8217;  (9.34). Muawiya said, &#8216;This verse is revealed regarding the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; So we had a quarrel and Mu&#8217;awiya sent a complaint against me to &#8216;Uthman.  &#8216;Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if  they had not seen me before. So I told this to &#8216;Uthman who said to me, &#8220;You may  depart and live nearby if you wish.&#8221; That was the reason for my being here for even  if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him . </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.489"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man  with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us  and said, &#8220;Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the  Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones  of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the  nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting.&#8221; After saying that,  the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him,  and I did not know who he was. I said to him, &#8220;I think the people disliked what you  had said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These people do not understand anything, although my friend  told me.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet said  (to me), &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?&#8217; And on that I (Abu Dhar) started  looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said, &#8216;I do not  love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah&#8217;s cause)  except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth.  No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious  advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.490"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 490: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;There is no envy except  in two: a person whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a  person whom Allah has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he gives his decisions  accordingly and teaches it to the others.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.491"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 491: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If one give in charity what  equals one date-fruit fro the honestly-earned money and Allah accepts only the honestly  earned money &#8211;Allah takes it in His right (hand) ar then enlarges its reward for that  person (who has given it), as anyone of you brings up his baby horse, so much s that it  becomes as big as a mountain </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.492"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 492: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Haritha bin Wahab : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;O people! Give in charity  as a time will come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity  and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested to take it) will  say, &#8220;If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken it, but to-day I am not in  need of it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.493"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 493: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not  be established till your wealth increases so much so that one will be worried, for no one  will accept his Zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, &#8216;I am not in need  of it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.494"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two  person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained  about the prevalence of robberies. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;As regards stealing and  robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina)  without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be  established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find  anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there  will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask  him, &#8216;Did not I give you wealth?&#8217; He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further  ask, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to you?&#8217; And again that person will reply in the  affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then  he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you  should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if  you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant  word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thy Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;A time will come upon the  people when a person will wander about with gold as Zakat and will not find anybody to  accept it, and one man will be seen followed by forty women to be their guardian because  of scarcity of men and great number of women. &#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.496"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 496: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work  as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they (the  people) said, &#8220;He is showing off.&#8221; And another man came and gave a sa (a small  measure of food grains); they said, &#8220;Allah is not in need of this small amount of  charity.&#8221; And then the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;Those who criticize such of the  believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity  except what is available to them.&#8221; (9.79). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.497"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 497: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Masud Al-Ansar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered us to give in  charity, we used to go to the market and work as porters and get a Mudd (a special measure  of grain) and then give it in charity. (Those were the days of poverty) and to-day some of  us have one hundred thousand. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.498"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 498: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim heard the Prophet saying: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Save yourself from Hell-fire even by giving half a  date-fruit in charity.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.499"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 499: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for  some alms), but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and she  divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything herself, and then she got  up and went away. Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story. He said,  &#8220;Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously (with  benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 24, Vol. 8). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.500"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 500: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Which charity is the most superior in reward?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The charity  which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to  become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, &#8216;Give so  much to such and such, and so much to such and such.&#8217; And it has already belonged to such  and such (as it is too late).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.501"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 501: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, &#8220;Who  amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Whoever has the longest hand.&#8221; So they started measuring their hands with a  stick and Sauda&#8217;s hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of  all in the caliphate of &#8216;Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of  practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to  practice charity. (Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.502"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 502: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;A man said that he  would give something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly  gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object of charity  to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. I will  give alms again.&#8221; And so he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to  an adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress  last night. The man said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to  an adulteress. I will give alms again.&#8221; So he went out with his alms again and  (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next morning said that he had given  his alms to a wealthy person. He said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had  given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man.&#8221; Then someone came and  said to him, &#8220;The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from  stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual  intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson  from it and spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah&#8217;s cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married.

You will be rewarded for what you intended. O Man! Whatever  you have taken is yours.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Bakr; sent me to (collect the Zakat from) Bahrein,  he wrote to me the following:&#8211; (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful).  These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made  obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever  amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat  collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he  should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for  every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to  thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to  forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to  sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to  seventy-five (camels), one Jadh&#8217;a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six  to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to  one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over  one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint  Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is  to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the  owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels  increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the  (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is  to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two  sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three  sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one  sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is  required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot  (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but  if the owner wants to pay he can.&#8217; </font></p>

And it is to be taken  from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in  that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don&#8217;t take) the best property of the people as  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water.&#8221; Anas  added, &#8220;When these verses were revealed:&#8211;&#8216;By no means shall you Attain righteousness  unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. &#8216; (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you  attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt,  Bairuha&#8217; garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in  charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it  where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Bravo! It is  useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be  proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.&#8217; Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle.&#8217; Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his  cousins.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On &#8216;Id ul Fitr or &#8216;Id ul Adha Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h)  went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered  the people to give alms. He said, &#8220;O people! Give alms.&#8221; Then he went towards  the women and said. &#8220;O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the  dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What is the reason for it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O women! You curse frequently, and are  ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and  religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.&#8221; Then he  left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Masud, came and asked  permission to enter It was said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is Zainab.&#8221; He asked,  &#8216;Which Zainab?&#8221; The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas&#8217;ub. He said,  &#8220;Yes, allow her to enter.&#8221; And she was admitted. Then she said, &#8220;O Prophet  of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give  it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody  else.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and  your children had more right to it than anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him.  Then he said, &#8220;The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will  befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which  will be disclosed to you.&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring  forth evil?&#8221; The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person,  &#8220;What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not  talking to you.&#8221; Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the  Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, &#8220;Where is the questioner?&#8221; It seemed as if  the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, &#8220;Good never brings forth evil. Indeed  it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals  sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces  the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet  and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans  and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever  takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth  will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

So she said to &#8216;Abdullah, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle whether it  will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under  my protection?&#8221; He replied &#8220;Will you yourself ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;  (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing  at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we  asked him, &#8216;Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my  husband and the orphans under my protection.&#8217; And we requested Bilal not to inform the  Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The  Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, &#8220;Who are those two?&#8221; Bilal replied that she was Zainab.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Which Zainab?&#8221; Bilal said, &#8220;The wife of &#8216;Adullah (bin  Masud).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive  a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping  his armor for Allah&#8217;s Cause (for Jihad).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The poor person is not the one  who goes round the people and ask them for a mouthful or two (of meals) or a date or two  but the poor is that who has not enough (money) to satisfy his needs and whose condition  is not known to others, that others may give him something in charity, and who does not  beg of people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No doubt, it is better for a person  to take a rope and proceed in the morning to the mountains and cut the wood and then sell  it, and eat from this income and give alms from it than to ask others for something.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of  the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The  Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa&#8217;s) and 1 Sa&#8217;= 3 kg.  approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, &#8220;Check what your garden will  yield.&#8221; When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, &#8220;There will be a strong wind  to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.&#8221; So we  fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away  to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to  the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their  place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked  that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, &#8220;Ten Awsuq,&#8221; and that was  what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I want to reach Medina  quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.&#8221; The  sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina  he said, &#8220;This is Taba.&#8221; And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said,  &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the  Ansar?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;The family of Bani-n-Najjar,  and then the family of Bani Sa&#8217;ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned  are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;On a land irrigated by rain water  or by natural water channels or if the land is wet due to a near by water channel Ushr  (i.e. one-tenth) is compulsory (as Zakat); and on the land irrigated by the well, half of  an Ushr (i.e. one-twentieth) is compulsory (as Zakat on the yield of the land).&#8221; </font></p>

Different persons would bring their dates till a big heap collected  (in front of the Prophet). Once Al-Hasan and Al-Husain were playing with these dates. One  of them took a date and put it in his mouth. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at him and took it out  from his mouth and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that Muhammad&#8217;s offspring do not eat what is  given in charity?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I gave a horse in Allah&#8217;s Cause (in charity) but that  person did not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell it at a  low price. So, I asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h) about it. He said, &#8220;Neither buy, nor  take back your alms which you have given, even if the seller were willing to sell it for  one Dirham, for he who takes back his alms is like the one who swallows his own  vomit.&#8221; </font></p>

So, when you reach  there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that  Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined  on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that  Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich  among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking  the best of their possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because  there is no screen between his invocation and Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his  family to be used as fire-wood.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah bestow His honor?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;No doubt, death came to him. By Allah, I too wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah will do with me though I am Al lah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216; By Allah, I never attested the piety of anyone after that.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the meal of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf was brought in front of him, and he said, &#8220;Mustab bin &#8216;Umar was martyred and he was better than I, and he had nothing except his Burd (a black square narrow dress) to be shrouded in. Hamza or another person was martyred and he was also better than I and he had nothing to be shrouded in except his Burd. No doubt, I fear that the rewards of my deeds might have been given early in this world.&#8221; Then he started weeping.</p>

Hamza was martyred and was better than I. Now the worldly wealth have been bestowed upon us (or said a similar thing).

<p style="text-align:justify;">We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Allah&#8217;s cause, and so our reward was then surely incumbent on Allah. Some of us died and they did not take anything from their rewards in this world, and amongst them was Mustab bin &#8216;Umar; and the others were those who got their rewards. Mustab bin &#8216;Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the Prophet ordered us to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind of shrub) over his feet.</p>

Then the woman said, &#8220;I have woven it with my own hands and I have brought it so that you may wear it.&#8221; The Prophet accepted it, and at that time he was in need of it. So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, &#8220;Will you give it to me? How nice it is!&#8221; The other people said, &#8220;You have not done the right thing as the Prophet is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never turns down anybody&#8217;s request.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;By Allah, I have not asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud.&#8221; Later it was his shroud.</p>

The Prophet got up, and so did Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, Muadh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The child was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the daughters of &#8216;Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Will you not prohibit crying as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said, &#8216;The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Umar used to say so.&#8221; Then he added narrating, &#8220;I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, &#8220;Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.&#8221; Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.</p>

I told him, &#8216;I am reduced to this state because of illness and I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter, (In this narration the name of &#8216;Amir bin Sad is mentioned and in fact it is a mistake; the narrator is &#8216;Aisha bint Sad bin Abi Waqqas). Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Abu Talib, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;) while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; (Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).</p>

He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

Go away from me.&#8221; When I talked too much he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During his sickness, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asking repeatedly, &#8220;Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221; And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 472:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness said, &#8220;Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet&#8217;s grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 473:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Aiyash :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan At-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet elevated and convex.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 474:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin &#8216;Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 475:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 476:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t abuse the dead, because they have reached the result of what they forwarded.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lahab, may Allah curse him, once said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Perish you all the day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;Perish the hands of Abi Lahab! And perish he!&#8221; (111.1).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, &#8220;Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has something to ask. (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this.&#8221; When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 482:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 483:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Actions while Praying</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.022.289"></a>Volume 2, Book 22, Number 289:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, &#8220;I slept across the bed, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly before or after it. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas added, &#8220;I got up and did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka Witr.

Will you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer.

Assalamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa-rahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-&#8216;ala &#8216;ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah&#8217;s mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . &#8220;</p>

Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day.</p>

Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8217; A shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his hermitage. Juraij said, &#8216;Where is that woman who claims that her child is from me?&#8217; (When she was brought to him along with the child), Juraij asked the child, &#8216;O Babus, who is your father?&#8217; The child replied, &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; &#8221; (See Hadith No 662.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, &#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221;</p>

While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu&#8217;ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, &#8220;O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik.&#8221; And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, &#8220;I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. &#8220;</p>

Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then said, &#8220;These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward.

So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, &#8216;Perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, &#8220;The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying.&#8221; And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.</p>

Will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217;.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, &#8220;What prevented you from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sent to Aisha by Ibn Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer and to say to her, &#8220;We were informed that you offer those two Rakat and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them.&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;I along with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them.&#8221; I went to Aisha and told her that message. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Go and ask Um Salama about them.&#8221; So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8220;I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, &#8216;Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them.&#8221; If he waves his hand then wait for him.&#8217; The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, &#8220;O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two Rakat after the Zuhr prayer. These (two Rakat that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani&#8217;Amr bin &#8216;Auf reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and so he went to them along with some of his companions to affect a reconciliation between them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delayed there, and the time of the prayer was due. Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has been delayed (there) and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time Allah&#8217;s Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (saw) Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217; for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 327:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to &#8216;Aisha and she was standing praying and the people, too, were standing (praying). So I said, &#8220;What is the matter with the people?&#8221; She beckoned with her head towards the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;(Is there) a sign?&#8221; She nodded intending to say, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 328:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle during his illness prayed in his house sitting, whereas some people followed him standing, but the Prophet beckoned them to sit down. On completion of the prayer he said, &#8220;The Imam is to be followed. So, bow when he bows, and raise your head when he raises his head.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol 1 for taking the verdict).</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayer at Night (Tahajjud)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.021.221"></a>Volume 2, Book 21, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa wa&#8217;duka-l-haq, wa liqa&#8217;uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Haq wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam, Haq, was-sa&#8217;atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa &#8216;Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama&#8217;a lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha ghairuka).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that &#8216;Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, &#8216;Wala haula Wala quwata illa billah&#8217; (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.&#8221; Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet said, &#8220;Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud.&#8221; After that &#8216;Abdullah (i.e. Salim&#8217;s father) used to sleep but a little at night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 223:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer eleven Rakat and that was his prayer. He used to prolong the prostration to such an extent that one could recite fifty verses (of the Quran) before he would lift his head. He used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the Fajr prayer and then used to lie down on his right side till the call-maker came and informed him about the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 224:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet became sick and did not get up (for Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 225:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gabriel did not come to the Prophet (for some time) and so one of the Quraish women said, &#8220;His Satan has deserted him.&#8221; So came the Divine Revelation: &#8220;By the forenoon And by the night When it is still! Your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither Forsaken you Nor hated you.&#8221; (93.1-3)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the Prophet got up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! How many afflictions Allah has revealed tonight and how many treasures have been sent down (disclosed). Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings up (for prayers), perhaps a well-dressed in this world may be naked in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet and asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you pray (at night)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get up He will make us get up.&#8221; When I said that, he left us without saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying, &#8220;But man is more quarrelsome than anything.&#8221; (18.54)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to give up a good deed, although he loved to do it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I offer it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people gathered, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning he said, &#8220;I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to you.&#8221; And that happened in the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to stand (in the prayer) or pray till both his feet or legs swelled. He was asked why (he offered such an unbearable prayer) and he said, &#8220;should I not be a thankful slave.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me, &#8220;The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha which deed was most loved by the Prophet. She said, &#8220;A deed done continuously.&#8221; I further asked, &#8220;When did he used to get up (in the night for the prayer).&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to get up on hearing the crowing of a cock.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ashath:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) used to get up for the prayer on hearing the crowing of a cock.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah Al-Muzni:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Pray before the Maghrib (compulsory) prayer.&#8221; He (said it thrice) and in the third time, he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to offer it can do so.&#8221; He said so because he did not like the people to take it as a tradition.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 278:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Marthad bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Yazani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani and said, &#8220;Is it not surprising that Abi Tamim offers two Rakat before the Maghrib prayer?&#8221; &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;We used to do so in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;What prevents you from offering it now?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Business.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 279:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-rabi&#8217; Al-Ansari,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he remembered Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, &#8220;I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I will do so.&#8217; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, &#8216;Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?&#8217; I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called &#8220;Khazir&#8221; which I had prepared for him.&#8211;(&#8220;Khazir&#8221; is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the neighbors got the news that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, &#8216;What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?&#8217; One of them replied, &#8216;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t say this. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell.&#8221; Mahmud added, &#8220;I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu&#8217;aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, &#8216;I doubt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle ever said what you have said.&#8217; I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or &#8216;Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.&#8221;</p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar narrated that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit the Mosque of Quba (sometime) walking and (sometime) riding. And he (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Umar) used to say, &#8220;I do only what my companions used to do and I don&#8217;t forbid anybody to pray at any time during the day or night except that one should not intend to pray at sunrise or sunset.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">The Two Festivals (Eids)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.015.069"></a>Volume 2, Book 15, Number 69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the &#8216;Id and when the delegations visit you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) replied, &#8220;This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter).&#8221; After a long period Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to Umar a cloak of silk brocade. Umar came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Sell it and fulfill your needs by it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 70:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, &#8220;Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, &#8220;Leave them.&#8221; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of &#8216;Id, and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry on! O Bani Arfida,&#8221; till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, &#8220;Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.</p>

It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same man added, &#8220;I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, &#8220;Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice.&#8221; Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the &#8216;Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk).&#8221; He (Abu Burda) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet&#8217;s tradition).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Abu Sa&#8217;id! Gone is that which you know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! What I know is better than what I do not know.&#8221; Marwan said, &#8220;People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer.&#8221;</p>

Ata told me that Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah, had said, ú- where was no Adhan for the prayer of &#8216;7d-ul-Fitr and &#8216;Id-ul-Aqha.&#8221; &#8216;At a&#8217; said, &#8220;I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah saying, &#8216;The Prophet stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.&#8217; &#8221; I said to Ata, &#8220;Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8220;No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?&#8221;</p>

He first offered the prayer and then delivered the Khutba. After finishing it he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised them while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading out his garment where the women were putting their alms.&#8221; I asked &#8216;Ata&#8217; whether it was the Zakat of &#8216;Id ul Fitr. He said, &#8220;No, it was just alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others would do the same.&#8221; I said, (to &#8216;Ata&#8217;), &#8220;Do you think that it is incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why should they not do so?&#8221; Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn Abbas had said, &#8220;I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and &#8216;Uthman in the &#8216;Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I came out (for the &#8216;Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse: &#8216;O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).&#8217; After finishing the recitation he said, &#8220;O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?&#8221; None except one woman said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Hasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet said, &#8220;Then give alms.&#8221; Bilal spread his garment and said, &#8220;Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies).&#8221; So the ladies kept on putting their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal&#8217;s garment.&#8221; Abdur-Razaq said, &#8221; &#8216;Fatkhs&#8217; is a big ring which used to be worn in the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.</p>

My sister said that they used to nurse the sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Her companion should let her share her veil with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8217; &#8221; Hafsa added, &#8220;When Um-&#8216;Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, &#8216;Did you hear anything about so-and-so?&#8217; Um-&#8216;Atlya said, &#8216;Yes, let my father be sacrificed for the Prophet (p.b.u.h). (And whenever she mentioned the name of the Prophet she always used to say, &#8216;Let my father be&#8217; sacrificed for him). He said, &#8216;Virgin mature girls staying often screened (or said, &#8216;Mature girls and virgins staying often screened&#8211;Aiyub is not sure as which was right) and menstruating women should come out (on the &#8216;Id day). But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla.

By Allah, I slaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;That was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Then Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep.

Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Leave them, for these days are the days of &#8216;Id and the days of Mina.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of black slaves in the Mosque and (&#8216;Umar) scolded them. The Prophet said, &#8216;Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe (protected)&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 13:</p>
<h3 align="center">Friday Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.013.001"></a>Volume 2, Book 13, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) saying, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection though the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures before us. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them but they differed about it. So Allah gave us the guidance for it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us in this respect: the Jews&#8217; (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians&#8217; (is) the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Anyone of you attending the Friday (prayers) should take a bath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Umar bin Al-Khattab was standing and delivering the sermon on a Friday, one of the companions of the Prophet, who was one of the foremost Muhajirs (emigrants) came. &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;What is the time now?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I was busy and could not go back to my house till I heard the Adhan. I did not perform more than the ablution.&#8221; Thereupon &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;Did you perform only the ablution although you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) used to order us to take a bath (on Fridays)?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male (Muslim) who has attained the age of puberty.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male Muslim who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with Siwak, and the using of perfume if it is available.&#8221; Amr (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I confirm that the taking of a bath is compulsory, but as for the Siwak and the using of perfume, Allah knows better whether it is obligatory or not, but according to the Hadith it is as above.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Any person who takes a bath on Friday like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first hour i.e. early), it is as if he had sacrificed a camel (in Allah&#8217;s cause); and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he had sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves to listen to the Khutba.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man entered (the mosque). &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What has detained you from the prayer?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;It was only that when I heard the Adhan I performed ablution (for the prayer).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Did you not hear the Prophet saying: &#8216;Anyone of you going out for the Jumua prayer should take a bath&#8217;?&#8221;.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman-Al-Farsi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for the Jumua prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the mosque), then prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tawus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;The people are narrating that the Prophet said, &#8216;Take a bath on Friday and wash your heads (i.e. take a thorough bath) even though you were not Junub and use perfume&#8217;.&#8221; On that Ibn &#8216;Abbas replied, &#8220;I know about the bath, (i.e. it is essential) but I do not know about the perfume (i.e. whether it is essential or not.)~</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tawus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the statement of the Prophet regarding the taking of a bath on Friday and then I asked him whether the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had ordered perfume or (hair) oil to be used if they could be found in one&#8217;s house. He (Ibn &#8216;Abbas) replied that he did not know about it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the Mosque and said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;I wish you would buy this to wear on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;This will be worn by a person who will have no share (reward) in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later on similar cloaks were given to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he gave one of them to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You have given me this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such and such a remark.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I have not given you this to wear&#8221;. And so &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan brother in Mecca to wear.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I had not found it hard for my followers or the people, I would have ordered them to clean their teeth with Siwak for every prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle I said, &#8220;I have told you repeatedly to (use) the Siwak. (The Prophet put emphasis on the use of the Siwak.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) got up at night (for the night prayer), he used to clean his mouth .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRahman bin Abi Bakr came holding a Siwak with which he was cleaning his teeth. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at him. I requested Abdur-Rahman to give the Siwak to me and after he gave it to me I divided it, chewed it and gave it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he cleaned his teeth with it and (at that time) he was resting against my chest.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to recite the following in the Fajr prayer of Friday, &#8220;Alif, Lam, Mim, Tanzil&#8221; (Surat-as-Sajda #32) and &#8220;Hal-ata-ala-l-Insani&#8221; (i.e. Surah-Ad-Dahr #76).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first Jumua prayer which was offered after a Jumua prayer offered at the mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle took place in the mosque of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais at Jawathi in Bahrain.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;All of you are Guardians.&#8221; Yunis said: Ruzaiq bin Hukaim wrote to Ibn Shihab while I was with him at Wadi-al-Qura saying, &#8220;Shall I lead the Jumua prayer?&#8221; Ruzaiq was working on the land (i.e farming) and there was a group of Sudanese people and some others with him; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila. Ibn Shihab wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead the Jumua prayer and telling him that Salim told him that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar had said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care. The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband&#8217;s house and is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master&#8217;s belongings and is responsible for them.&#8217; I thought that he also said, &#8216;A man is the guardian of his father&#8217;s property and is responsible for it. All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said &#8220;We are the last (to come amongst the nations) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection. They were given the Holy Scripture before us and we were given the Quran after them. And this was the day (Friday) about which they differed and Allah gave us the guidance (for that). So tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) is the Jews&#8217; (day), and the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday) is the Christians&#8217;.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) remained silent (for a while) and then said, &#8220;It is obligatory for every Muslim that he should take a bath once in seven days, when he should wash his head and body.&#8221;</p>

She was asked why she had come out for the prayer as she knew that Umar disliked it, and he has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, &#8220;What prevents him from stopping me from this act?&#8221; The other replied, &#8220;The statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) : &#8216;Do not stop Allah&#8217;s women-slave from going to Allah s Mosques&#8217; prevents him.&#8221;</p>

But the people disliked it. Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush.&#8221;</p>

They used to pass through dust and used to be drenched with sweat and covered with dust; so sweat used to trickle from them. One of them came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was in my house.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people went to Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi and told him that they had different opinions regarding the wood of the pulpit. They asked him about it and he said, &#8220;By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was made, and no doubt I saw it on thy very first day when Allah&#8217;s Apostle I took his seat on it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, &#8216;Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.&#8217; So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8216;I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du. By Allah, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-contented with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and &#8216;Amr bin Taghlib is one of them.&#8221; Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah&#8217;s Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels.</p>

The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited &#8220;Tashah-hud&#8221; (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud) might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out.&#8221;</p>

He was covering his shoulder with a big cloak and binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;O people! Come to me.&#8221; So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du.&#8221; &#8220;From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers.&#8221;</p>

Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Allah (for rain)&#8221;. So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Allah (to protect us)&#8221;. So the Prophet I raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O Allah! Round about us and not on us&#8221;. So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina&#8217;s (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about the abundant rain.</p>
