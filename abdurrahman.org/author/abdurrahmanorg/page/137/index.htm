		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Huqooq Da&#8217;at Ilayhal-Fitrah wa Qarrarthash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pp.11-13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Relatives are those who are related to you through blood and close ties; such as the brother, the uncle, the aunty, or their children. Everyone who has a tie of relation with you has certain rights upon you in accordance with how closely they are related to you. About this, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And give to the relative his right.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-lsraa 17:26]. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And worship Allaah alone, and do not set-up any partner to Him in worship, and be kind and good to the parents, and to the relatives.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon everyone to treat their relatives in the best possible manner, and to support them in accordance with their needs, and what they seek of help and support. And this is what is necessitated by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Islaamic Law), the <i>&#8216;aql</i> (sound reasoning) and the <i>fitrah</i> (natural state).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many textual evidences encouraging and urging <i>silatur-rahm</i> (joining the ties of relations); such as what Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah created the creation, until when He finished doing so, the Rahm (womb/ties of relation) stood-up and said: Is this the place of one who seeks refuge in You from those who severe and cut ties with me. So Allaah said: Yes, Indeed. Would it please you that I keep ties with those who keep ties with You, and cut-off ties with those who cut-off ties with you? So the Rahm said: Yes, indeed! So Allaah said: Then this is for you.&#8221;</i> Then Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <b>&#8220;Recite if you wish: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, cause corruption in the land, and cut-off ties of relations. They are those upon whom is the curse of Allaah, so that He makes them deaf and blinds them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:22-23].&#8221;2 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day let him keep the ties of relations.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many people do not fulfill this <i>haqq</i> (right) and transgress the bounds concerning this. Some of them do not seek to join ties with relatives or show kindness to them; neither through wealth, nor through good behaviour, nor through the giving of occasional gifts and presents nor through rendering help to them in their rimes of need. indeed, many days or months may pass without even seeing or visiting them. And sometimes, rather than seeking to join ties of relations, some people even intend to severe such ties, by seeking to harm their relatives &#8211; either through words, or action, or both. Such people may even keep close ties with those who are not relation, yet cut-off ties with relatives!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people only keep ties of relations with those who maintain ties with them, but cut-off from those who cut-off from them. So such people are not truly the <i>waasils</i> (those who keeps ties of relations), but rather they are those who do so based upon tit for rat. So they will only keep ties with those who keep ties with them whether relatives, or other than them. However, the true <i>waasil</i> (one who keeps ties of relations) is the one who keeps ties of relation for the sake of Allaah &#8211; regardless of whether his relations keep ties with him or not. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The waasil (one who keeps the ties of relations) is not the one who merely does so out of reciprocation. Rather, the waasil is the one who even when the relatives cut-off from him, yet he still maintains ties with them.&#8221;</i> So a man asked: O Messenger of Allaah. I have relatives with whom I maintain ties of relations, yet they cut-off from me. I treat them kindly, yet they treat me in an evil manner. And I am forbearing and patient with them, yet they behave rudely and ignorantly towards me. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;If the situation is as you say, then it is as if you are filling their mouths with sand. And Allaah will continue to aid and support you as long as you continue doing what you are doing.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were no other rewards for keeping ties of relations, except that Allaah keeps ties with the <i>waasil</i> in this world and the Hereafter, and that He extends His Mercy due to it, and makes affairs easier through it, and removes distress and anxieties by it, then that would be more than sufficient. However, along with this, <i>silatur-rahim</i> (joining the ties of relations) brings with it closeness to one&#8217;s family and relatives, as well as love and compassion developing between one another, and their being mutual help, in times of ease and hardship. between one another, and other such joys and delights &#8211; as is experienced and well-known. And when ties of relations are not maintained, then each one of the aforementioned benefits turn to their opposites, and great harm comes to the society.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;My Advice to the Women&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;Naseehati Lin-Nisaa&#8217; &#8221; (My Advice to the Women).   I typed this excerpt from the english translation published by Tarbiyyah Bookstore.  To save time in typing, I omitted the chains of narration for the ahadeeth (but still included all references), as some of them were rather long.  Other than that, I didn&#8217;t deviate from the translated text, translated by the brother Abul-Layth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter: Whoever Does Not Show Mercy Will Not Be Shown Mercy (pages 117-122):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, kissed Al-Hasan while Al-Aqra ibn Haabis at-Tameemee was sitting near him.  A-Aqra said, &#8220;Indeed I have ten children and I have never kissed any of them.&#8221;  The Messenger of Allah looked at him and said,  &#8220;Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.&#8221;  [Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Shaddaad ibn Aws who said that the Messenger of Alah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, said, &#8220;Verily Allah has perscribed al-ihsaan (excellence) for everything.  So when you kill, you should kill in the best manner.  And when you slaughter, you should slaughter in the best manner.  Let each of you sharpen his knife to provide ease for his animal.&#8221;  [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-ihsaan&#8221; or &#8220;excellence&#8221; in the arabic language is procifency in performing an action, while perfecting it with sincerity.  In Islaamic law, Al-Ihsaan is what the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, has explained in his statement:  &#8220;That you worship Allah as though you see Him, but since you are un able to see Him, then He most certainly sees you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said concerning the prophetic narration of Shaddaad, &#8220;This prophetic narration indicates the obligation of excellence in all of the actions.&#8221;  [Jami&#8217;Al-Uloom 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy which can be shown to a child is kissing him:  &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said that a Bedouin man came to the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, and  said, &#8220;You (people) kiss the children and we do not kiss them.&#8221;  So the Prophet said, &#8220;Is there anything that I can do once Allah has removed mercy from your heart?&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umayr ibn Ishaaq said, &#8220;I was with Al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee when we met with Aboo Hurayrah who said, &#8220;Show me where I might kiss you in the place where I saw the messenger of Allah kiss.&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;Al-Qameesah&#8221; (shirt or upper garment), He said, &#8220;So he kissed the front of his stomach.&#8221;  [Ahmed with a hasan chain]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is carrying him while in prayer.  Abu Qataadah said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us with Umaamah bint Abeel-&#8216;Aas on his shoulders.  Then he prayed.  When he bowed, he placed her on the ground and when he rose from bowing, he lifted her back off the ground.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Shaddaad, from his father, who said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us for one of the &#8216;ishaa prayers carrying Hasan and Husayn.  The Messenger of Allah stepped forward and set them both down.  Then he prayed and prostrated between their backs a single prostration that was lengthy.  My (Abu Shaddaad&#8217;s) father said, &#8216;Then I raised my head and the child was on the back of the Messenger of Allah while he was prostrating.  I then returned to my prostration.&#8217;  So once the Messenger of Allah had completed his prayer, the people said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, certainly you have prostrated between two backs in your prayer.  Certainly the length of this prostration led us to believe that something had happened or that revelation had decended upon you.&#8217;  He, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8216;None of that occured, rather this child moved around me and I didn&#8217;t wish to disturb him until he had finished.&#8217;  [hadeeth collected in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, authenticated by Shaykh Muqbil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to smaller children is playing with them:  Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid ibn Sa&#8217;eed said, &#8220;I came to the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, along with my father and I was wearing a yellow shirt.  The messenger of Allah said, &#8216;Sanah, sanah!&#8217; (this means &#8216;good&#8217; in the ethiopian langauge)  Umm Khaalid further said, &#8216;Then I started playing with the seal of Prophethood.  My father admonished me, but the Messenger of Allah said (to my father) &#8216;Leave her.&#8217;  The Messenger of Allah then addressed me saying, &#8216;Ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee.&#8217; (Trans. note: This phrase &#8216;ablee wa akhliqee&#8217; is used by the arabs to supplicate for an extended life.  Its meaning could be conveyed in the following expression: &#8216;May you live so long that your garments become worn and ragged.&#8217;)  So she (Umm Khaalid) remained this way until (this supplication for her became actualized and subsequently) she would be mentioned by the people,&#8221; meaning that she would remain until her garments became old and ragged.  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 425/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mahmood ibn Ar-Rabee&#8217; said, &#8220;I remember when I was a boy of Five years old, the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, took water from a bucket with his mouth (majjatan majjahaa) and threw it in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh said, &#8221; &#8216;Majj&#8217; is the expelling of water from the mouth.  It is said that nothing is refered to as &#8216;majj&#8217; except if it is from a distance.   The action of the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, with Mahmood was either from his play with him or it was a means of blessing him with it just as he used to do with the children of his companions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Maalik said, &#8220;Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to spend time with us to the extent that he even said to my young brother, &#8216;Oh father of &#8216;Umayr, what did the little birdie do?&#8217;  &#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 526/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, from the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is placing the child in one&#8217;s lap.  &#8216;Usaamah ibn Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to take me and place me on his thigh and he would place al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee on his other thigh, then he would come close to us and say, &#8220;Oh Allah!  Please be merciful to them, for indeed, I am merciful to them.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 434/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this is how one might be affectionate with the smaller children concerning everything they might need or how they might be amused.  This is an appropiate means of showing them mercy and affection, as long as this does not lead towards bringing about improper behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, has praised the women of Quraysh because they possessed praiseworthy characteristics and from them is their affection for children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated upon Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8220;The best wome to ever ride the camel were the women of Quraysh.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 511/9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said, &#8220;The most righteous from the women of Quraysh are those who are most affectionate (&#8220;ahnaah&#8221;) to the child during its youth and who are most protective concerning their husband&#8217;s property.&#8221;  Al-Haafidh said that &#8220;ahnaah&#8221; is from affection, which is compassion and tenderness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy that is shown to the young children and other than them is from the reasons that cause a person to achieve the mercy of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also reached us from the Prophet, slallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, that he said, &#8220;He is not from us who does not show mercy to the young and does not honor the old.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Baazmool<br>
Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of the concise booklet <b><i>“Fildhaat-ul-Akbaad Huqooq-ul-Awlaad”</i></b> (Your Flesh and Blood: A Lecture on the Rights of Children). The source used for the translation was the 2006 Daar-ul-Istiqaamah Edition. The origin of this publication in the Arabic language was a lecture the Shaikh gave which was then transcribed and published in book format. All quotes and narrations are referenced in the original publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although small in size, this booklet presents the readers with a valuable discussion on some of the rights and privileges of children, which parents are obligated to fulfill. Indeed, it is not only the children who will be asked concerning their behavior towards their parents on the Day of Judgement but also the parents will be asked concerning their children and how they raised them. Therefore, we must know the rights of our children and strive to fulfill our duties towards them so that they in turn may serve as righteous deeds for us and benefit us after we die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool is one of the well known people of knowledge in Saudi Arabia. Currently, he serves as a member of the teachers’ committee in the College of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen at Umm-ul-Qurraa University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. He has authored numerous books and given many lectures, some of which have been transcribed, as is the case with this booklet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has given importance to the caring and maintaining of our flesh and blood since their inception – from the time that a Muslim thinks about getting married. The Messenger ordered every youth to strive towards marriage on the condition that he can accommodate a wife, i.e. he has the ability to fulfill the responsibilities of marriage and the obligations of marital life.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thereafter, he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to choose a righteous wife. This is since the Messenger informed us of the effect that a person’s immediate family has over him in the narration reported by Abu Salamah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan who related from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <b>‘There is no child except that he is born upon true faith (Fitrah), but it is his parents that make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian. Just as an animal gives birth to a baby animal that is whole, do you find it mutilated?’</b> Then Abu Hurairah recited: <b>‘…the Fitrah of Allaah which He created mankind upon.’</b> [Surah Ar-Room: 30]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah has instructed us how to expiate this fitnah. Hudhaifah reported: ‘We were sitting one day with ‘Umar when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said: <b>‘A man’s trials with regard to his family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A Muslim may work and comply with all of the things (we just mentioned) and ask Allaah for success and assistance. However, what occurs may be something other than what you intended. So you must know that this is part of Allaah’s Divine Decree which He has allowed to occur. Just look at the son of the messenger of Allaah, Nooh, and at how he wasn’t righteous. And look at the wife of Loot who also wasn’t righteous, as well as the wife of Nooh, even though they were married to prophets of Allaah. Allaah says: <b>‘And Nooh called upon his Lord and said: ‘O my Lord, verily my son is of my family! And certainly Your promise is true, and You are the most just of judges. He said: ‘O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family. Verily, it is an act that is dishonorable. So do not ask Me about that of which you have no knowledge. I admonish you lest you should be one of the ignorant.’ Nooh said: ‘O my Lord! I seek refuge in you from asking You about that which I have no knowledge of. And unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.’</b> [Surah Hood: 45-47]”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foreword by the translator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, May His prayers and blessings be upon the final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the greatest blessings of Allaah Ta&#8217;aala upon this Ummah is that He has placed wisdom in the hearts of the people of knowledge. Just as one of the Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever has many Aathaar (narrations), then he speaks with wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the people of knowledge of our time was the great Muhadith, Faqih, Allaama ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani – May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is an amended transcript of one of the many, many sittings with the illustrious Shaykh, where he was asked about the issue of Takfeer. The sitting took place in Jordan. The transcript was amended by the Shaykh to make it suitable for print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask our Lord Azza wa Jal to make this work a beacon of light, illuminating the path for those who have lost the way. We also ask Him to reward our noble Shaykh al-Albaani and place him in the hereafter among the ranks of the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and they are the best of companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evil of our selves, and the evil of our actions. Whom ever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and who ever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah Azza wa Jal, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the issue of Takfeer generally, is not only for the rulers, but it is also for the ruled. It is an old and extensive fitnah that was germinated by a sect from the Islaamic sects of old who were known as the khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with great sadness that – some of the callers to the Deen or those who are too enthusiastic &#8211; have fallen outside the realm of the Book and the Sunnah! But in the name of the Book and the Sunnah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first reason is them being shallow in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is &#8211; and this point is very important &#8211; that they never understood the regulations of the Sharia&#8217;. The Sharia&#8217; is the foundation of the Authentic Islaamic Dawah. All those who are outside the Authentic Islaamic Dawah are regarded as being from the deviated sects away from the Jamaa’aah which the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; praised in more than one hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this Jamaa’aah which even our Lord Azza wa Jal mentioned, and explained that whomsoever went outside this Jamaa’aah has indeed broken away from Allaah and His Messenger. That is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed Allaah Ta’ala, in a matter, that has a very clear command according to the people of knowledge – did not summarize His statement by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him . . . We shall keep him in the path&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clearest evidence here is that Allaah associated contradicting and opposing the Messenger with following a way other than the believers&#8217; path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Understanding the Book &amp; the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, following or not following the path of the Believers is a very important matter in relation to complying or denying that path. So whosoever follows the path of the Believers, then he is successful with the Lord of the worlds and whosoever differs from the path of the Believers, then Hell is sufficient for him – and what an evil destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point, numerous groups, old and new deviated because they never sufficed themselves to adhering to the path of the Believers. Instead, they rode on their own intelligence. Instead, they followed their own desires in trying to understand the Book and the Sunnah. Then they built upon their desires, their very dangerous results, and with that they left what the Salaf-As-Saalih – may Allaah be pleased with all of them- were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized this section of the noble Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;follows other than the path of the believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized it by using an eloquent emphasis, in more than just one authentic prophetic ahadeeth. These ahadeeth, which I will indicate to and mention some of, are known amongst the general Muslims, let alone the scholars of the Muslims. But what is unknown about these ahadeeth, is that they direct one towards the obligation and necessity of adhering to the path of the Believers in their understanding of the Book and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point has been forgotten – and its importance and its necessity have been forgotten by many of the specific people, not to speak of those who have become known – in these modern times &#8211; as &#8216;Jama’at Al- Takfeer &#8216;! Or by some of those kinds of groups who ascribe themselves to Jihaad, whereas in reality they are the scattered, defeated remnants of Takfeer! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst these types of people, there may be some who may very well in the depths of their hearts be righteous and sincere people. However, this alone is not sufficient for its possessor to be successful and for one to prosper with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this it is necessary for the Muslim to combine two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Having truthful sincerity in ones intention, with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Following correctly what the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not only sufficient for a Muslim to be sincere and serious in respect to acting with the Book and the Sunnah and calling towards it. But, in addition to this, his methodology should be correct, good and upright; and his methodology cannot be complete in itself except by following what the righteous Salaf of this Ummah were upon – may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these well known and established ahadeeth &#8211; that build a foundation for what I have said – as I indicated previously it is the hadeeth of the 73 sects, and it is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jews had split up in to 71 sects and the Christians had split up into 72 sects, and my nation will split up into 73 sects all of whom will be in the fire except one. The Companions asked, ‘Which one O Messenger of Allaah?’ He replied: The Jamaa’aah.” In another narration: “What I am upon and my Companions are upon.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find the Prophet&#8217;s answer, agreeing perfectly with the previous Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Follows other than the path of the Believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who primarily enter into the generality of this Ayah are: the Companions of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, since the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was not content in this hadeeth with just saying: “What I am upon…..”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this would actually be sufficient for the Muslim who truly understands the Book and the Sunnah. But he &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – adapted practically Allaah’s saying, when Allaah characterized His Prophet that he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;For the Believers he is full of pity, kindness, and mercy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – perfect kindness and his complete mercy for his Companions and his followers, that he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – clearly illustrated for them the distinction of the saved sect. Which implies that the are people and companions of the saved sect are upon what the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was also upon, and what his Companions were upon after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed – for the Muslims generally and the callers to Islaam specifically &#8211; to be content with just understanding the Book and Sunnah using the means of understanding which are well known. Such as knowledge of the Arabic language, the knowledge of abrogated and abrogative texts and other such rules. But it is necessary, primarily to return in all of this back to what the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -were upon, because they were – which is clear from their traditions and their biographies – the most sincere to Allaah Azza wa Jal in worship. They had more of an understanding of the Book and the Sunnah than us, and many other praise worthy characteristics with which they were shaped, and cultivated with its exquisite manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What resembles this hadeeth perfectly – in respect to its fruits and benefits &#8211; is the hadeeth of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, which is narrated in the books of as-Sunnan from the narration of al-Irbaad bin Saireeyah &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. He said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble, and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said, “It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I advise you to hear and obey, even if an African slave rules over you, and indeed whomsoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth……………….” To the end of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof from this hadeeth is also the same evidence from the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -about the previous question (about the 73 sects). In as much as he compelled his nation to follow the characteristics of his Companions due to their adherence to his Sunnah, and he did not limit it to just that, but rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“……And the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for us – and this being our situation &#8211; to constantly repeat always and forever this fundamental principle. If we intend to understand our Aqeedah, understand our worship, and understand our manners and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for us to return to our Salaf-us-Saalih to understand all these matters, which are necessary for a Muslim, so that he can actualize in himself &#8211; with sincerity – that he is from the Saved Sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point many of the sects of old and new have deviated, when they did not pay heed to the evidence in the previous Ayah, and to the significance of the hadeeth of the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, and likewise the hadeeth of the splitting of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it was completely natural that they deviated like those who deviated previously from the Book of Allaah, and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and the manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those who deviated were the Khawaarij of old and of recent times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the foundation of the fitnah of Takfeer in this era &#8211; rather, since a long time &#8211; is surrounding the Ayah, which they themselves always keep mentioning, which is none other than His Ta&#8217;alaa saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed are the kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they take this Ayah without a deep understanding, and they present it without detailed knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that this noble Ayah has been repeated and ends with three different wordings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are oppressors&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are transgressors/sinners&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from complete ignorance that those who reason with just this Ayah with its first wording which is : &#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221; that they have not become acquainted with – at the very least &#8211; with some of the other texts of the Sharia&#8217;, whether from the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah, in which the word (al-kufr ) is mentioned. Instead they have taken it – without any understanding to mean exiting from the Deen, and that there is no difference between the one who fell into kufr, and between those mushrikeen from the Jews and the Christians and followers of the other faiths outside the faith of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the word al-kufr in the language of the Book and the Sunnah does not – always &#8211; carry this meaning, which they constantly repeat, and attempt to impose their wrong and erroneous understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter of this word (al-kufr ) whereas it does not direct to one meaning, is also the matter of the other two words &#8220;the oppressors&#8221; and &#8220;the transgressors/sinners&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the one who is characterized as an oppressor or sinner does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen, so the same goes for the one characterized that he is a kaafir, that it does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This diversity in the meaning of one word, that is indicated by the language, and the Sharia&#8217; came with the Arabic language; the language of the Noble Qur’aan. Due to this, it is obligatory on those who want to issue judgment on the Muslims; &#8211; regardless if it is the ruler or the ruled &#8211; that they be upon knowledge of the Book and Sunnah and in the light of the Salaf Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to understand the Book and the Sunnah – and also what is contained within it- except with the path of the Arabic language and its literature, knowing it specifically and precisely. If the student of knowledge has a deficiency in the understanding of the language, what will help him in rectifying this deficiency is returning to the understanding of the scholars before him. Especially if they are the people from the first three generations that have been certified with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Kufr less than Kufr</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we return to this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so they are the kaafiroon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the intent of the word (al-kufr ) here? Does it take one outside of the Muslim Ummah or does it mean something else?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is necessary to have precision in understanding this Ayah. The Ayah could mean the kufr of action and that is leaving off some of the actions from the rulings of Islaam. In addition, what helps us in this understanding is the scholar of the Ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan, Abdullah bin Abbas -may Allaah be pleased with him. He was from the Companions that all Muslims are in agreement – except those who are from the deviant sects – that he is an Imaam in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if he heard in those days, the likes of what we hear today exactly, that there are people who understand the Aayaat on its apparent meaning without its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: “It is not the kufr which you understand to mean, indeed it is not the kufr which takes you outside the fold of the Ummah, it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps he means the khawaarij &#8211; who rebelled against, the Ameer ul-Mumineen Ali &#8211; may Allaah be please with him – and as a result of that they spilled the blood of the Believers, and they did to the Believers what is not done even by the Mushrikeen. Ibn Abbas said: “The matter is not like what they have said or what they presume but indeed it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear, precise answer from the explainer of the Qur’aan. The explanation of the Ayah, from which it is not possible to have an understanding other than this (i.e. kufr less than kufr) from the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, this is what we indicated towards previously in the beginning of this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the word al-kufr, which is mentioned in many Quraanic texts and ahadeeth, is not possible to explain – regarding all these texts &#8211; that the meaning is equal to exiting outside of the Ummah. Like this is the example of the well-known hadeeth which is in the two authentic books of hadeeth (Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) on the authority of Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ood -may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Cursing a Muslim is fassooq (sinful) and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the kufr mentioned here is sinning and it is disobedience, and the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who is regarded as the most eloquent in expression &#8211; was intense in expressing rebuke, and he said: “…….. and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From another angle we can question, is it possible for us to understand from the first section of this hadeeth – “Cursing a Muslim is fassooq…………” with the same word fisq (sin) which is mentioned in the previous Ayah with the third wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so those are the fasiqoon&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is; it could mean that the word fisq also corresponds in its meaning to the word kufr which means going out of the Ummah. It could be that the word fisq also corresponds in meaning to the word kufr which does not mean going out of the Ummah, but indeed it means just what the explainer of the Qur’aan said: It is the kufr lesser than kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth emphasizes that the kufr here could be with this meaning; because Allaah Azza wa Jaal mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if two parties among the believers fall into fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight against the one that which rebels till it complies with the command of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed here our Lord has mentioned the rebel sect which fights the truthful believing sect, and along with this Allaah did not judge upon the rebel sect that they were kuffar, even though the hadeeth says: “. . . killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore killing him is a kufr lesser than kufr, exactly like Ibn Abbas said in the explanation of the previous Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim killing a Muslim is oppression and aggression against him, and evil and kufr, but this meaning of kufr, could be kufr of action, and perhaps could be kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From here comes the precise detailed exposition whose explanation and commentary was given by the Imaam in truth, the Shaykh of Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; and then after him his devoted student Ibn Qayeem al-Jawzeeyah who took on this responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they were blessed in making aware and explaining the division of kufr into these two divisions, whose banner was raised by the explainer of the Qur’aan with those concise and complete words. Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- and his student and companion Ibn al-Qayeem always repeatedly mentioned the necessity of distinguishing between the kufr of action and kufr of belief. Otherwise the Muslim would fall into, without knowing, the fitnah of rebelling against the community of Muslims, into which fell the khawaarij of old and some of their adherents of today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The summary of this is: indeed his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; saying, “… killing him is kufr” does not mean, &#8211; in absolute terms &#8211; going out of the Ummah. There are many hadeeth regarding this. All these hadeeeth are irrefutable evidence upon those who only hold their own deficient understanding of this previous Ayah, and cling to the explanation that this is kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For now, this hadeeth is sufficient for us, because it is a definitive proof that a Muslim killing his brother Muslim is kufr with the meaning: kufr of action and it is not the kufr of belief!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, if we return to the &#8216;Jamaat al- Takfeer &#8216; – or to those who branched off from them &#8211; and their accusation of the rulers and of those who live under their custody, and those who live under their leadership and those appointed by them, of kufr and apostasy!! Then this is built upon their evil view, which is they say: that these people have perpetrated a sin, so they have become kuffar because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Relationship between Takfeer &amp; Rebellion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the general matters which are beneficial to mention and narrate: I met some of those who used to be from Jamaaat al- Takfeer then Allaah Azza wa Jaal guided them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: here you call some of the rulers kuffar, so what do you think, for example of making the imams of masaajid kuffar, and those who give the khutbah, and those who give the adhaan in the masaajid, and those who render service to the masaajid?! What do you think about making Takfeer of the teachers of the knowledge of the Sharia&#8217; in schools, and other places, for example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: they are kuffar because they are pleased with the rule of the rulers who judge without what Allaah has revealed!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: If this &#8216;being pleased&#8217; was in agreement with the heart (i.e. belief), judging without what Allaah has revealed, then the kufr of action is altered to the kufr of belief. So, any ruler, who rules without what Allaah has revealed, and sees and believes that this ruling, is the appropriate ruling to be applied in this time! And that the ruling of the Sharia&#8217; from the text of the Book and Sunnah is not appropriate to be applied, then there is no doubt that this kufr of this ruler is the kufr of belief and is not the kufr of action alone, and whoever is pleased with this, and believes it, then he also falls into the same group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said to them: Firstly, it is not possible for you to make a judgment upon every ruler who rules with the western kufr laws or with even some of them, and that if they were questioned about judging with other than what Allaah has revealed?! They would answer; that ruling with these rules is the truth and correct in this time! And it is not allowed to rule with the rules of Islaam!! Otherwise, if they say this, they would – truly- become kuffar without doubt or suspicion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, if we came down to the people who are ruled, and from amongst them there are the scholars, amongst them are the righteous people etc. So how can you judge upon them with kufr just because you see them living under the rule, which includes them just as it includes you exactly! But you declare them to be kuffar, and apostates and that ruling with what Allaah has revealed is obligatory! Then you make an excuse for yourselves and contradict yourselves: that differing with the judgments of the Sharia&#8217; with mere actions does not deem necessarily the ruling on the one who differs with the Sharia&#8217; that he is an apostate from his Deen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly what the people other than you are saying, whether you accuse them – wrongly – with the ruling of Takfeer and apostasy!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the general discussions which show their mistakes and uncover their deviation, is saying to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When is a judgment given upon a Muslim that he has apostated from his Deen? A Muslim who testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and perhaps he prays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient just one time? Or is it obligatory to be announced that he has apostated from the Deen?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not know the answer! They will not be guided to the truth!! So we are forced to give them the following example; we say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A judge, judges with the Sharia&#8217;; this is his usual practice and this is his system, but in one judgment he misjudged, and gave a judgment against the Sharia&#8217;, i.e. he gave the right to the oppressor and prohibited it from the oppressed, so this is – most certainly &#8211; judging without what Allaah has revealed! So do you say that his kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: No, because this happened to him one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: What if the same judgment was issued from him a second time or a different judgment in which he also differed with the Sharia&#8217;, so has he committed kufr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we repeat this to them: he does this &#8216;three times!&#8217; or &#8216;Four times!&#8217; when do you say that he has committed kufr? It is not possible for them to place a limit on the number of his judgments in which he has gone against the Sharia&#8217;, by which he can be declared a kaafir!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is completely possible if it is known from him that he, in his first judgment deemed it correct to judge without what Allaah has revealed, &#8211; believing it is permissible to do so &#8211; and disapproved of judging with the Sharia&#8217;, then it would be correct to judge him with apostasy, even for this first judgment!<br>
Contrary to this, if we saw several judgments from him in a number of decisions in which he went against the Sharia&#8217;, and if we were to ask him why did you judge without what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would reply saying: I was frightened and afraid for myself! Or I was bribed for example and that is worse than the first example, but along with this, it is not possible to say he is a kaafir until he declares what is in his heart, that he does hold the view of judging without what Allaah Azza wa Jaal has revealed, and only then is it possible to say that he is a kaafir, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A summary of the speech: it is necessary to know that kufr, like fisq(sinning) and oppression is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Kufr and fisq and oppression which places one outside the Ummah, and all of these return to making it permissible by the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-The other does not place one outside of the Ummah; and all of these return to making it permissible by actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takfeer of Sinners is not Allowed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every type of sin and specifically what is widespread in this time from what is regarded as permissible actions, such as interest, illegal sexual relations, drinking alcohol amongst them, all of these are kufr of action. So it is not allowed for us to make Takfeer of the sinners- who have been deceived by some of these sins &#8211; just because they have perpetrated a sin and regarded it as permissible actions for themselves! Except if it becomes apparent to us – with certainty – and it is unveiled with what is in the depths of their ownselves that from their Aqeedah they do not prohibit what Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited. So, if we know they have fallen into this opposition with their hearts, then we can judge that they have committed kufr, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we don’t know this, then there is no way for us to judge them with kufr, because we fear we will fall into the threat of the saying of his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; : “If a man says to his brother: ‘Oh kaffir! Indeed it returns to one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ahadeeth mentioned with this meaning. I will mention a hadeeth, which is a great evidence. It is in the story of that Companion who killed one of the mushrikeen .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the mushrik saw that he was about to come under the blow of the sword of the Muslim Companion, he said, “I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah!!” The Companion took no interest in that and killed him!! When the news reached the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; he disapproved of it severely. The Companion mentioned an excuse that he did not say what he said except from the fear of being killed, but the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did you open up his heart?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the kufr of belief does not have a fundamental connection with just actions, but it has a connection with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not possible for us to know what is in the heart of the faasiq (sinner) or the adulterer or the thief or the one who is a fornicator nor the one who takes interest, etc. Except if he confesses with his tongue what is in his heart. As far as his action is concerned then it is notification that he has opposed the Sharia&#8217;, with a differing of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we say: without doubt you have opposed the Sharee&#8217;ah! and indeed you have committed fisq(a sin)! and adulterated! But we do not say: &#8216;Indeed you have become a kaafir and apostated from your Deen&#8217;, until there manifests from him something which will be an excuse for us with Allaah Azza wa Jaal in judging him regarding apostasy and following that comes the well know ruling in Islaam which is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -:“Whoever changes his Deen then kill him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said and I continue to say to those who constantly make Takfeer of the Muslim rulers: let’s suppose the kufr of these rulers is the kufr of apostasy! And suppose there was a ruler who was above them, then it would be obligatory – in this situation &#8211; on that higher ruler to implement the Islaamic punishment on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, how do you benefit yourselves practically if we agree for the sake of argument that all of these rulers are kuffar, and their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What can you possibly do and establish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Takfeer is say: for the sake of &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217;, loyalty to the believers and disassociation from the kuffar!! Then we reply to them: loyalty and disassociation are connected to friendship and hate – by the heart and by actions -, and it is dependent on capability, therefore it is not conditional that you proclaim Takfeer, and declare apostacy, just because &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217; are present. Rather, friendship and hate could both take place in an innovator, sinner, or an oppressor!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I say to these people, here we have the kuffar, and they have occupied the many lands of Islaam! We are with sadness being trialed with the occupation of Palestine by the Jews. What is possible for us and for you to do about it? Is it important to stand – alone – against those rulers whom you think and claim are kuffar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If only you had left this issue alone, and started laying down the foundation for the structure, on which the foundations of an Islaamic government stands, which is following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, this is how he educated his Companions, and they built from this source its system and its foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mention this a lot, and we emphasize it a lot: that it is necessary for all Muslim organizations to work in truth, in order to bring back the rule of Islaam. Not only in the Islaamic lands, but on the whole earth, and that is the fulfillment of His Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance the Deen of Truth, to make it superior over all other religions even though the Mushrikeen hate it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been mentioned by prophecies in some of the prophetic hadeeth is that this Ayaat will be realized at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For it to be possible for the Muslims to implement this Qur’aanic text and this divine promise, it is necessary to follow an evident path and a clear way. Will this evident path be by announcing a revolution against these rulers of whom it is thought that their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?! Then along with their suspicion, which is wrong and a suspicion which is mistaken, they cannot do anything!!<br>
So what is the methodology? What is the path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt that the correct path, which is an exemplary path, is what the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; used to constantly talk about and remind his companions about in every khutbah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammed &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon all the Muslims without exception and specifically those who busy themselves with the return of Islaamic rule, that they begin from where the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – began. We have labeled this in two concise words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Purification and Education</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we know the firmly established reality, which is being neglected or more accurately purposely neglected, by those extremists who do not have anything except that they proclaim Takfeer of the rulers, and then nothing else!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they continue to proclaim Takfeer of the rulers then nothing stems from them, or about them, except discord and strife!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The calamities in these past few years which have been by the hands of these people, beginning from the discord (fitnah) of the Haraam of Makkah to the dissension in Egypt and the killing of Sadaat. Finally, in Syria and now in Egypt and Algeria- a sight that everyone can see; the shedding of the blood of many of the innocent Muslims because of these fitn, tribulations, and the occurrence of many trials and calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this because they opposed many of the texts from the Book and the Sunnah and the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes in the meeting with Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we really want to establish the rule of Allaah on the earth – in reality not just in a claim &#8211; then do we start with making Takfeer of the rulers while it is not possible for us to confront them – let alone fighting them &#8211; or do we start – with the obligation &#8211; the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; started with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the answer is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow……&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what did the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -begin with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known – with certainty &#8211; to anyone who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge that he began with the Daw’ah between individuals whom he thought were ready to accept the truth. Then whoever was ready to respond to him, from the individuals of the noble Companions responded to him &#8211; as it is well known in the prophetic biography. Then the punishment and the severity befell these Muslims in Makkah. After that came the command for the first migration and the second until Allaah Azza wa Jal consolidated Islaam in al-Madeena al-Munnawara. From there began the skirmishes and the opposition. Also, the fighting between the Muslims and the kuffaar on one side and the Jews from the other.……etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is necessary for us to begin by teaching the people the true Islaam; like the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had begun. Now we cannot just confine ourselves to teaching alone, because things have entered into Islaam which are not from it, and has no association with Islaam, from the bida&#8217; and innovations which were the reason for the clear downfall of the lofty status of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this it is obligatory upon those inviting to Islaam to begin with purification of Islaam from what has entered into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle – “Purification”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second principle – “Education”<br>
The education that is associated with this purification is the education of the young active Muslims on this pure Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we study the reality of the Islaamic groups which have existed, for nearly a generation, and their ideas and the practice of these ideas. We would find that many of them have not benefited themselves, nor have they benefited others with anything that can be remembered! Despite their outcry and noise, that they want an Islaamic government!! Which was a reason of spilling blood of the innocent with this baseless argument!! Without them having realised anything from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We continue to hear from their beliefs which are opposed to the Book and Sunnah and actions which are negated by the Book and Sunnah, let alone them trying, again and again with futile attempts which oppose the Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I say: there is a statement which one of the propagators of Islaam said, which I used to hope that his followers would adhere to it and fulfill it, which is: &#8216;Establish the Islaamic state in your heart it will be established for you on the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because If a Muslim corrects his Aqeedah built upon the Book and Sunnah, then there is no doubt that from this he will correct his worship, correct his behavior and his manners etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, with regret, these fine words have not been acted upon by these people, they persist with an outcry to establish the Islaamic state but without any benefit! and it is said about them – and I swear by Allaah to this &#8211; what the poet said is true:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hope for success and you do not follow its path<br>
Indeed a ship does not sail on dry land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps in this what I have mentioned is persuasive enough for every just person, and a termination for every oppressor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">If someone asks how is it that Allah wants something yet He dislikes it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How one can understand such concept?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We all know that there are many drug prescriptions disliked and hated for their smell and taste, yet when it is known that there is a cure in them, we take them and we love them for that! Traveling a long and difficult journey to achieve something desired and loved is another example. If it is known that a surgical removal of a diseased part of the body would save the rest of it, it is disliked and hated from one side and liked from another. So, it is not contradictory to have love and hate combined in addressing one matter. This is true with the created being, so what about Allah the Creator Whom there is nothing hidden from Him and to Whom belongs the Perfect Wisdom? He, the Exalted, hates a matter in itself and, on the other hand, wants it because of its link to yet another matter, or because it is a means that leads to something He loves. In all of His actions, Allah has the Perfect Wisdom. We may recognize part of His Wisdom, or the general aspects of it, but not its complete details. One vivid case about this subject, is the Creation of Iblees, who is the sponsor of every corruption and evil in this world. He is hated from one side, yet Allah wanted his creation because he is a means for many beloved things to Allah, and that there is great wisdom behind his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, there is wisdom behind the creation of calamities, sufferings, hardships, etc. that speak about the Favors of Allah, His Justice, and His Mercy. Some of this wisdom includes[1].</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Tests for the believers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Training and strengthening of the believer’s faith.</li>
<li>An evidence for the weakness of man and his need for his Rabb, and that he has no success unless he humbles himself to his Creator.</li>
<li>A way to expiate sins and an elevation to higher degrees in the Sight of Allah.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is nothing (in the form of trouble) that touches the believer, even the pricking of a thorn, except that Allah decrees a good for him or effaces one of his sins because of that.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a means for receiving reward for both, the ill Muslim and the Muslim doctor in charge.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Witnessing the occurrence of favors and blessings after calamities and hardships, has more profound effects and generates a meaningful and proper appreciation of Allah’s Power, Wisdom, Mercy and Justice. He, the Exalted, is to be Praised on all of His Decrees.</li>
<li>An appreciation for good health and the well-being of one’s self.</li>
<li>A reminder about what is more devastating, Hell. A lesson to remember and a build up of eagerness for Paradise.</li>
<li>&#8230;And many more wisdoms of which we may know or we may not know. We cannot say: How did Allah allow this and prevent that? Nor how did He create this, and how come He did not create that? …Nothing escapes His Ability, and nothing occurs in His Kingdom except that He had willed it; He owes us nothing; if He gives, then its His Favor and if He prevents, then it is His Justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>“If Allah (Subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) puts a person under certain tests and trials and the person recognizes that He must resort to Allah alone seeking His help, then this is a good sign for him; the trials turn to purification and mercy. If, on the other hand, he rejects, complains, and turns away from Allah and resorts to human beings like him, then this is a bad sign for him; the trials turn to punishment and misery upon him”[3].</p>

</span>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What Benefits the Dead</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The likeness of wealth, family and the actions of the son of Âdam is of a man who has three companions. One of the man’s companions says: I am with you as long as you live; when you die, you have taken your share of yourself and you have taken your share of me &#8211; this is his wealth. The second companion says: I am with you until you reach that tree; you have had your share of yourself and your share of me &#8211; this is his family. The third companion says: I am with you in life and in death.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above authentic hadîth is in fact like the following hadîth in meaning and in subject matter. Anas said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The dead person is followed (to his grave) by three: His family, his wealth and his actions. Two of them return and only one remains. His family and wealth return, but his actions remain.”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two ahâdîth show that actions alone endure and enter the grave with their doers. Both these ahâdîth also affirm the fact that anything other than actions &#8211; such as wealth, servants or relatives &#8211; are of no benefit at all. Rather, they all return (to this world). His wealth becomes the property of his inheritor, whilst his relatives and family do not grant him anything from Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahâdîth intend to direct Muslims to be concerned with actions which will stay with them forever; and not to strive for wealth and position for the sake of relatives, family and servants. Apparently, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> wanted to show us the value of good actions when he related these ahâdîth to us, (which can be found) in the books of <i>Zuhd</i> (renouncement of the world). He pointed out to us that because actions will last rather than wealth, you have to make your actions righteous. Part of making ones actions righteous is through good wealth that is earned lawfully and spent in a good manner. Then one gains the rewards of <i>’amalus-sâlih</i> (a righteous action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Acceptable Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in these ahâdîth, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> encouraged us to make our actions righteous, whether gaining wealth or other things. However, we must remember a certain fact about this action, a fact that many people neglect. The explanation of this fact should actually be a complete lesson in itself; and it is that only a <i>righteous action</i> is beneficial, not just any action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what are the conditions that a Muslim must fulfill in order for the action to be righteous? This is shown in the statement of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i>: <b>“Say (O Muhammad): Verily I am only a man like yourselves, but revelation has been revealed to me that the One whom you should worship is only One Deity. And whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do righteous actions; and in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Two Important Conditions</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars of <i>Tafsîr</i> have said that the end of this verse is an indication that there are two conditions for an action to be righteous and acceptable: [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Firstly</i></b>: That the action must be in accordance with the Sunnah. Therefore, if the action is done as an act of worship, but is not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is not a righteous action. The reason is that compliance with the Sunnah is one of the conditions for the action’s righteousness. The proofs of this are many, but it is enough to state one: The hadîth of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> in which he said: <i> “Whoever innovates in this matter of ours what is not upon it, it shall be rejected.” </i>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, any action that was not part of Islâm when Allâh revealed it upon the heart of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> is not a righteous action. About this, Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: <b> “This day I have perfected your Dîn for you and completed My favour upon you and I have chosen Islâm as your Dîn.”</b> [7] It must be remembered that <i>Bid’ah</i> (innovation) [8] is not divided into five categories, as some Scholars say. A proof for this is that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</i> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>: That after being in accordance with the Sunnah, the action has to be sincere, purely seeking the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; because Allâh says at the end of the aforementioned verse: <b> “And in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b> This means that the person seeks, by his righteous action, only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. However, if he seeks other than Allâh, then he has setup partners with Allâh (made shirk with Allâh), therefore his action is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed by Allâh in an authentic hadîth Qudsî: <i>“I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having any partners. Thus, whosoever does an action for the sake of someone else as well as Me, will have that action rejected by Me, to him whom he associated with Me.” </i>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if the action is righteous but not sincere for the sake of Allâh’s Face, it is rejected. Moreover, if the action is purely for the sake of Allâh’s Face, but not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is likewise not accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Worthless and Sinful Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these arc the two conditions for every action to be a righteous action. If one of these conditions is not present, the action does not become a righteous action, rather, it becomes an evil one. Had the person not done this action, it would have been better for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays two <i> rak’ât </i> of prayer at night, while others sleep, then even if he prays them according to the Sunnah &#8211; without addition or deletion &#8211; but he does this so that people may talk about him and say: “This Person is a righteous man. He prays at night when the people are asleep,” then his action becomes <i> bâtil</i> (null and void), since he did not sincerely seek the Face of Allâh alone, but rather he sought the praises of people, thus becoming sinful by associating partners with Allâh in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if his action only became null and void, then the following hadîth would apply to him; and he would not be punished for this action: <i>“How many fasting people obtain nothing from their fasting except hunger and thirst. And how many people who stay up at night (praying), obtain nothing from their being awake except sleeplessness and tiredness.”</i> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this is not the case, for this person’s action has changed into a sin. The two <i> rak’ât</i> that this person performed without intending to seek only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; are the same as if he had disobeyed Him, that is to say: He will be punished for these two <i> rak’ât </i> because he associated others along with Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays eleven <i> rak’ât</i> at night with the intention, in this worship, that his brothers would say about him: “This man is correctly following the Prophet; he does not add to the Sunnah,” his action becomes null and void; and his action changes to a sin against him. Rather, he must pray according to the Sunnah but sincerely seeking only the Face of Allâh &#8211; the Most High. He must be absolutely free of seeking the pleasure of others along with Him in this worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been but a summary about the action that does not leave the person but enters the grave with him &#8211; whether the action was good or bad &#8211; and that what is of benefit is the person’s righteous action. What is a righteous action and what are its conditions? The two conditions are:- <i><b>Muwwâfaqah</b></i> (compliance) with the Sunnah; and <i><b>Ikhlâs</b></i> (sincerity and purity of intention) to Allâh. Therefore, one must remember these two conditions and act upon them so that one may become righteous and pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Safeguarding against Insincerity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people unfortunately neglect the first condition (complying with the Sunnah) because they are astray and believe that <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation) is good in the religion.[12] But there are those upon whom Allâh has granted His favour, by guiding them to the Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. They are those who know the reality of this condition and adhere to it the best they can. Yet they must pay attention to the second condition, which either group may fail to fulfill, and that is <i>riyâ’</i> (insincerity and showing-off). No one is exempt from <i>riyâ’</i> and all people are susceptible to it in their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a very serious one and must be stressed here, so that we may know that we are in need of making our actions correct and purely for the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. Part of this is that we are tested even while making <i> Da’wah</i> to the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah, for trials are not only in evil matters, but also in the good matters:<b> “And We test you with evil and good, by way of <i>fitnah</i> (trial).”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>da’wah</i> has been neglected by Muslims throughout the world so that the <i>du’ât</i> (the callers) have become strangers. Not only are they strangers in foreign countries, but they are strangers even in their own countries; amongst their relatives and brothers. This makes them praiseworthy, but they must not stand up to be praised for this <i>da’wah</i>. This is the reality, for the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Verily Islâm started as something strange and it will return as something strange, so Tûbâ is for the Strangers.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tûbâ and the Strangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <i>Tûbâ</i> in the Arabic language is: “Praise and thanks.” The meaning according to the <i>Sharî’ah</i> refers to a tree in Paradise, which would take a rider a hundred years to traverse its shade. [15] This hadîth gives glad tidings to the newcomers of Paradise in which there is: <i>“What no eye has never seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined.”</i> [16] This tree is mentioned in the Qur’ân in the statement of Allâh: <b>“<i>Tûbâ</i> is for them, and the best abode.”</b> [17] Therefore, <i>Tûbâ</i> is for the Ghurabâ (the Strangers), but who are they? The answer to this is in the reply of the Prophet: <i>“Those who correct [themselves and others], when the people have become corrupt.”</i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Need for Care</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Strangers call the people to the revival of the Sunnah and eradication of all that differs from it. However, they must still pay attention to the second condition of the righteous action: To be sincere in their <i>da’wah</i>. They must neither seek fame, pride, nor arguments from their <i>da’wah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They must not seek anything that <i>an-Nafs ul-Amârata bis-Sû’</i> (the soul that calls them to evil) orders them to do. Whatever they call to is as a result of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i> &#8211; having ordered them to make <i> da’wah</i> to the Qur’ân and the Sunnah and to make<i> da’wah</i> to what the Muslims have neglected. They must take care of this <i>da’wah</i>. However, they stand in danger. It can happen that one may say a word seeking only to have fingers of praise pointed at him, not sincerely advising the people and desiring to guide them. Rather, to do that for fame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we mention a saying of some <i>Sûfîs</i>, who have some wise sayings that can not be denied: “The love of fame breaks backs.” Therefore, I insist, that we who make <i> Da’wah</i> to the Sunnah be sincere in our actions so that when our actions enter the grave with us, it will help us to answer correctly when we are asked: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your religion?” If the deed is evil, when the person enters the grave, he will deny it. His deed will come to him in the worst of forms. He will ask it: “Who are you?” It will say: “I am your deed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Wealth &#8211; its Reality and Purpose</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Hadîth is also authentic. Abû Hurayrah said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth! However, he gets from his wealth three things: What he eats and finishes. What he wears and makes shabby; and what he gives away and pleases others with. Whatever else is besides this, goes and is left for the people.”</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadîth also emphasises the subject of the previous ahâdîth. It shows us the care taken by people in amassing wealth. Allâh pointed this out in the Qur‘ân by His statement: <b>“And for the love of good he is strong.”</b> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet depicted the nature of mankind for us in his saying: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth!”</i> Nevertheless, what is the amount that remains left over for him from his wealth? Is all his wealth for him? No! He gains from his wealth only the examples that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> specified. The first is defined by the Prophet’s statement: <i>“What he eats and finishes.”</i> From his wealth is that which is necessary for him to survive and that which enables him to accomplish the rights of Allâh. These rights are the rights of His <i> Tawhîd</i> (singling out Allâh alone for worship), as Allâh said: <b> “And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is what a person wears until it becomes shabby. Add to this that which he volunteers and does good with, which is mentioned in the statement of the Prophet: <i>“Or what he gives away and pleases others with.”</i> He got rid of his wealth by giving it away to another in charity. Therefore, the wealth that is for the servant is the amount that he eats and the amount that he wears in order to survive. However this is not an end in itself. Rather, one exists solely to accomplish the obligation of worship, as we pointed out previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third kind of wealth that returns with a benefit is not only the obligatory charity, but it also includes non-obligatory charities. Then the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> explained what is left after these categories. He said: <i>“And other than that is gone, and is left, for the people.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relation of this Hadîth with the previous one is: Why do people exhaust themselves in amassing wealth, when this is the reality of wealth? They do not benefit from there wealth except the amount that they eat, drink and with which they help other people. All else will be left and it will remain for the people who inherit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Hadîth is also <i>Sahîh</i> (authentic). Abdullâh ibn ash-Shikhkhîr said: I came to the Prophet whilst he was reciting: <b>“Seeking increase diverted you.” </b> The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> “The son of Âdam say My wealth! My wealth! What do you obtain, O son of Âdam, from your wealth except that which you eat and consume, or wear until it becomes shabby, or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadîth is also similar in meaning to the previous one, though some of its words are different; and was recorded by Muslim, at-Tirmidhî and an-Nasâ‘î. This hadîth is clear in its wording, however, the statement of the Prophet at the end of the hadîth: <i>“or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i> may not be clear to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Generosity and Miserliness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement aims at drawing one’s attention to the fact that what is intended for charity is that which he actually gives away. It is not sufficient that a person should just make out a will, that he should give such and such to the poor, or such and such for a specific masjid. However, the Prophet calls our attention to the fact that benefit is in that wealth which a person actually gave away during his lifetime, since he did not really know what would happen with his wealth after he died, if he had made a will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with this word, the Prophet points to a hadîth in the <i> Sahîh</i> of al-Bukhârî &#8211; the meaning of which is that the miser is one who when death comes to him makes a will and says: “Give so and so such amount and for so and so such and such amount.” The Prophet said: <i>“This was already for so and so and so and so.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> meant was that the deceased did not own anything anymore. He had left this <i>dunya</i> (life of this world ) and had entered into the <i>Âkhirah</i> (the Hereafter) and his inheritance will remain for those people who are still alive. Then should not the person have made his will earlier? Should he not have given charity whilst he was strong, hoping to be rich and fearing poverty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the nature of the people today, they say: “Hoard your white Dirham for your black day.” They hoard this money for themselves for when they become old. They are covetous of this wealth. The generous person is the one who gives away his own wealth when his own soul is attached to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is on the brink of death and who says: “Give so and so such and such amount,” he is a miser and is not generous. Rather, a truly generous person is one who gives charity whilst he holds onto his life and also whilst he loves this wealth very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Insignificance of this World</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next hadîth is narrated by Jâbir ibn ’Abdullâh: The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> passed by the market place coming from the direction of ‘Âliyah and people were around him. He passed by a dead kid goat (i.e. a baby goat) which had very short ears. He held it by its ears and said: <i>“Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?”</i> They (the Companions) said: We would not want it even for less than that! What can we do with it? He said: <i>“Do you wish to have it (for any price)?”</i> They said: By Allâh, even if it were alive it (we would not want it), as it has very short ears, let alone now when it is also dead! The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all.”</i> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us return to the hadîth. He passed by the market place <i> “and the people were around him.”</i> Here I would like to pause a little in order to remind people about some of the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> that most of the Shaykhs of today have neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykhs of today walk with their students behind them. This was not the way of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. The ahâdîth describing this are many and the following is from them: “He used to walk side by side with Abû Bakr and side by side with Abû Hurayrah; and they all walked with each other.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically proven that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> used to say to his Companions <i>radiallâhu ’anhum</i>, when he used to walk with them: <i> “Walk in<br>
front of me and leave my back for the angels.”</i> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here he highlights two matters from one saying. People do not see angels, they see only people. Therefore, if anyone saw the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> walking, they would only see people walking in front of him. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic hadîth: <i> “He who humbles himself for the sake of Allâh, Allâh will raise him.” </i>[25] His humbleness raised him to a degree whereby the angels walked behind him. Therefore, is a noble person one behind whom people &#8211; good or bad &#8211; walk; or is he the one who is followed by those described by Allâh in the following verse: <b> “They do not disobey what Allâh ordered them to do and do precisely what they are commanded.”</b> The nobility of the Prophet manifested itself in a visible and an invisible side. The visible side is that the Companions used to walk in front of the Prophet and not behind him. The invisible side is that the angels walked behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the first phenomenon is the one in which we are ordered not to act proudly with our companions and our brothers in faith, even those who may be less than us in knowledge, morals, worship and righteousness. This is enough for us, because Allâh says: “Do not sanctify yourself. He knows best the ones who are pious.” [26] It is sufficient for us at least, to walk with people side by side. Whosoever intentionally goes against this Sunnah, without doubt, does not truly love the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. This is because one’s degree of love from him, is based upon following him. This is established in the Qur’ân by the statement of Allâh: <b> “Say (O Muhammad): If you do love Allâh then follow me; Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins.”</b> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this was the case with the Prophet who was infallible and protected from the whispering of the <i>Shaytân</i> and this was an indication of the level with his Companions, then what can we say about ourselves? We are not infallible and are not protected from the <i>Shaytân</i>. We must adhere to this Sunnah as if it were obligatory. It is better for us to walk with people around us than to walk looking with our eyes at the backs of their shoulders. The statement of the Prophet, at the end of the hadîth: <i>“By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all,”</i> is to be reflected upon by people of intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next authentic hadîth is similar to the previous hadîth. Ibn ’Abbâs said: The Prophet passed by a dead goat that had been thrown away by its owners. He said: <i>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this is to its owner.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl ibn Sa’d said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“If this world was worth as much to Allâh as the wing of a mosquito, He would not have given a disbeliever even a sip of water.” </i>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmân said: Some people came to the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and he asked them: <i>“Do you have food?”</i> They said: Yes. He asked: <i>“Do you have drink?”</i> They said: Yes. He said: <i>“Verily their outcome is like the outcome of this world, one of you stands behind his house holding his nose from their bad smell.”</i> This is the similitude of this world. What is the eventual outcome of food and drink? They change to stool and urine. Therefore, a person hates the smell for himself. This is the similitude of the outcome of this World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following hadîth has the same meaning. Ubayy ibn Ka’b said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Indeed the food of the son of Âdam is like the example of the world. Even if he puts spices and season into it, see what becomes of it.” </i>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the eventual outcome of spices and seasoning in his food? Look at what it becomes! Likewise, this world becomes a similar thing except that which is for Allâh. The next hadîth explains this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The world and all that it contains is cursed, except for the remembrance of Allâh and what supports it; or a Scholar and a student.” </i>[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality of this world in the <i> Sharî’ah</i>, it has no value. The similitude of this world is like good food and drink: its outcome is decay. The exceptions arc those things which are done for Allâh whether remembrance of Allâh, knowledge or even food because it helps to support the worship of Allâh. These things are among the deeds of man that endure in this fleeting life. The goal behind these <i> ahâdîth</i> is that a person should not be overly concerned about this world, except with which is sufficient to keep him alive and strong; and sufficient enough to be able to accomplish the worship of his Lord. For if his wealth is greater than this, it will only benefit him by the amount of good that he does by helping others; otherwise, he is going to leave this wealth behind and it will not benefit him at all. However, what will benefit him are the righteous actions that he has done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allâh not to put love of this world in our hearts, but to guide us to earn in this life what helps us to worship and obey Him. And all praise is for Allâh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are things which nullify Imân (Faith) i.e. Belief, just as there are things which nullify Wudhû&#8217;. If a person does any single one of them, he loses his state of ritual purity. The same is true with Belief. The nullifiers of Belief can be classified into four categories:<i>First category</i>: Denial of Rabb&#8217;s existence or reviling and speaking ill of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Second category</i>: Denial of Allâh&#8217;s right to be worshipped or worshipping anything or anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Third category</i>: Denial of any of Allâh&#8217;s Names or Attributes established in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah or reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourth category</i>: Denial of the role of Muhammed (pbuh) as the messenger of Allâh, or reviling His Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Denial of the existence of Rabb nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first category encompasses several types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Pure atheism; such as the belief of communists who deny that the universe has a creator and say: &#8220;There is no god, and life is a purely material phenomenon.&#8221; They attribute the creation and all actions to pure chance, or &#8220;nature&#8221; but forget the One Who created even the &#8220;chance&#8221; and the &#8220;nature&#8221;, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affaires, Guardian, etc.) over all things.&#8221; (39:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category of disbeliever is more hardened in their apostasy than the polytheist Arabs of post-islamic period, and even Satan himself, as those polytheist Arabs did admit the existence of their creator as the Qur&#8217;ân states about them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: &#8216;Allâh&#8230;'&#8221; (43:87)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Qur&#8217;ân mentions the statement of Satan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(Iblîs) said: I am better then he, You (Allâh) created me from fire, and You created him from clay.&#8221; (38:76)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of disbelief for a Muslim to say, &#8220;Nature created something or that it came into being by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or if a person claims to be the Rabb; as Pharaoh claimed saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I am your lord, most high.&#8221; (79:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or to claim that there are great saints [called &#8220;Qutb&#8221; in Sufi terminology, which literally means axes (of creation)] who have control over what happens in the universe, even if this claim is accompanied with the admissions that Allâh, the Soverign Lord exists. People who have this belief are in a worse condition than the idol worshippers before Islâm, who used to admit that Allâh is the Sole Controller of the affairs of the universe, as is indicated by Allâh&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs? They will say: &#8216;Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh&#8217;s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh?'&#8221; (10:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or the statements of some Sufis that Allâh pervades in His creation, or became incarnate in it. The Sufi, Ibn Arabi, who is buried in Damascus, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord is a slave, and the slave is my Lord. I only wish I knew, which one is the Mukallaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mukallaf is a basic Sharî&#8217;ah terminology, that refers to the essential role of the adult, sane human being: That he or she is charged by Allâh with a series of duties and responsibilities, orders and prohibitions, and he will be questioned on the basis of how well he discharged his responsibilities.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this transgressor of the Sufis has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the dog and the pig is nothing other then our deity, nor is Allâh other then a monk in a church.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Hallâj (a Sufi of Baghdad) stated: &#8220;I am He (i.e. the Rabb) and He is I.&#8221; Due to this statement of his, which he would not retract; the scholars agreed that he should be executed as an apostate. High Exalted is Allâh above what such people say. <b>2. Shirk (polytheism) in Worship nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second category includes the denail of Allâh as the object of worship or ascribing a partner along with Allâh. It too has various manifestations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the trees, Satan or any other created being, and abandon the worship of Allâh, Who created all these things which have no power to benefit nor to harm. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allâh Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.&#8221; (41:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Those who worship Allâh, and worship along with Him some of His creations, such as saints, as embodied in idols, grave-worship, etc. The Arab idol worshippers before Islâm were of this category, as they used to call upon Allâh only in times of hardship and pressing need, and would worship others in times of ease. As the Qur&#8217;ân described them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worships to others.&#8221; (29:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are characterized as Al-Mushrikûn, (i.e. those who associate and attribute partners with Allâh), even though they made supplication to Allâh Alone when they were afraid of drowning at sea, because they didn&#8217;t stay like that. Instead they called upon others after He saved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Since Allâh was displeased with the idol worshipping Arabs before Islam, He branded them as Kâfiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), and ordered His Prophet to fight them, because they called upon others besides Allâh at the time of ease. He didn&#8217;t accept their whole-heartedness when they called upon Him alone in hardship, and He labelled them Mushrikîn. Therefor, what can we say about certain Muslims today, who resort to dead saints at the time of ease as well as at the time of hardship? And they ask of them only Allâh has the power to bestow, like curing the sick, and granting sustance and guidance, etc., and they forget the Creator of those saints, whereas He is the only One Who cures, the Substainer, and the Guide. And those dead people have no power at all and cannot even hear those who are calling upon them, as Allâh stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the datestone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammed pbuh) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and every thing).&#8221; (35:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit to the effect that the dead cannot hear those who call upon them, and explicit in stating that their supplication is major Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them might say: &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that these saints and righteous people have the power to benefit or harm. We only take them as intermediaries who will intercede with Allâh on our behalf, and through them we get closer to Allâh.&#8221; Our reply to them is that the idolaters before Islâm used to hold a similar belief, as is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship besides Allâh things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8216;These are our intercessors with Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?&#8217; Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!&#8221; (10:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving that whoever worships and supplicates other then Allâh, he is a Mushrik even if he believes that those other beings cannot benefit nor harm, but only sees them as intercessors.<br>
Allâh said about the idolaters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those who take Awliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): &#8216;We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.&#8217; Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.&#8221; (39:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving the disbelief of those who call upon other than Allâh with the intention of getting thereby closer to Allâh.<br>
The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Because supplication is worship&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Among the nullifiers of Belief is to rule by other than what Allâh has revealed; if it is accompanied by the belief that Allâh&#8217;s Laws are inappropriate or less appropriate, or that man made laws which contradict them are equally appropriate; Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship non but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221; (12:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfîrun (i.e. disbelievers &#8211; of a lesser degree as they do not act upon Allâh&#8217;s Laws).&#8221; (5:44)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the ruler is applying a law other than what Allah has revealed, while believing that the revealed Law is the only Legitimate Law, but he is contradicting it on the basis of personal whims and inclinations or because of what he considers to be external pressure beyond his control, then he is injust and tyrannical or corrupt, but he did not cross the line of disbelief. This is according to the statement of Ibn Abbas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever repudiates what Allâh has revealed, the he surely disbelieved, while one who accepted it (while acting in contradiction to it), he is unjust and corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the interpretation of the verse chosen by the great exegete Ibn Jarîr At-Tabari, and &#8216;Atâ said with regard to the second state:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A level of disbelief below the level which takes one out of Islâm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who suspended the Laws of Allâh and replaced them with man-made laws which oppose them, believing in the validity of their man-made laws, they have disbelieved and gone out of Islâm by the consensus of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Among the nullifiers of Belief is displeasure with Allâh&#8217;s Legislation, or the opinion that it is too confining and strict or that it imposes undue hardship. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammed pbuh) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221; (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or to dislike the orded which is revealed, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain. That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur&#8217;ân and Islâmic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (47:8,9)</b> 3. Shirk in Allâh&#8217;s Attributes nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third category includes denail of some of all of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes or His Names or speaking ill of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It nullifies Belief when a believer denies the Names of Allâh or His Attributes which are established by the texts of the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic Sunnah; for example, to deny that Allâh&#8217;s Knowledge is total, or His Power, or His Life or His Hearing or Sight or Speech or Mercy, or His Establishment over His Throne or His Transcendence above it, or His Descent to the lowest heaven or that He has a Hand or an Eye, or other than that of the Attributes which befit His Splendour and which do not resemble the attributes of anything in creation. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (42:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse Allâh denied His Resemblance to His creatures, and attributed to Himself the faculties of hearing and sight; and all His other Attributes must be understood in the same way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is an error and misguidance to interpret something some of His affirmed Attributes, and to change the meanings of the words used to describe them from their primary meaning in the Arabic language to obscure meanings, like the interpretation of the word Istawâ which means ascension and establishment above something, to mean Istilâ which means to take power. Imam Al-Bukhâri in his Sahîh transmitted the authentic interpretation of Istawâ from Mujâhid and Abul-&#8216;Âliyah, two of the prominent scholars among the Tabi&#8217;în, the successors of the Sahâbah. The diversionary interpretation of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes leads to their denial. As the interpretation of Istawâ meaning to take power is, in fact, a denial of one of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes, which is Allâh&#8217;s Elevation above His Throne, which is established in numerous places in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).&#8221; (20:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221; (67:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh recorded a Book which is with Him above the Throne.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of interpretation of the Divine Attributes is a form of distortion as Shaikh Muhammed Amîn Shinqeeti states in his book &#8220;Manhaj wa Darâsât feel-Asmâ&#8217;i was-Sifât &#8211; Studies in the (Divine) Names and Attributes&#8221; on page 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To sum up the issue, I would like to make two points. First the interpreter should consider Allâh&#8217;s Statement to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;say Hittatun&#8230;&#8221; (2:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hittatun means repentance, they added a letter &#8220;N&#8221; in it and said &#8220;Hintatun&#8221;, Allâh called this addition a change. Allâh said in Surah Al-Baqarah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh&#8217;s obedience.&#8221; (2:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are those who interpret Allâh&#8217;s Attributes with diversionary interpretation. It was said to them Istawâ so they added an &#8220;L&#8221; and said Istawlâ. Consider the resemblance between the &#8220;L&#8221; they added and the &#8220;N&#8221; the Jews added (this point was originally mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. There are certain Attributes which are exclusive to Allâh, like Knowledge of the unseen, which no one in creation possesses. Allâh said in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), non knows them but He&#8230;&#8221; (6:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh might reveal certain aspects of the unseen to His Messengers through Revelation when He wants, Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to non His Ghaib (unseen) except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes)&#8230;&#8221; (72:26,27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the statements of disbelief and error is the statement of the poet Al-Busairy in Qasîdah Burdah describing the Prophet (pbuh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from your generosity is the world and its rival (that is the Hereafter) and a part of your knowledge is the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This world and the Hereafter are certainly part of the creation of Allâh and from His Generosity, not from the generosity or creation of the Messenger, as the poet claimed.<br>
Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).&#8221; (92:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (pbuh) does not know what is in the Preserved Tablet, nor what the Pen wrote, as the poet claimed, since this is part of the absolute unseen, which no one knows exept Allâh. As the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh.&#8221; (27:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saints, it is only logical that they have less access to knowledge of the absolute unseen as they do not even have access to direct Revelation by which Allâh informed His Prophets and Messengers of certain aspects of the unseen, because Revelation does not descend on saints; it is reserved for Prophets and Messengers, so whoever else claims knowledge of the unseen, and whoever believes their claims, has nullified his belief in Islâm. The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or astrologer and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&#8221; (Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Occasionally the predictions of these fortuntellers do turn out true, but part of that is due to chance, because they are guessing and trying to extrapolate on what they already know. If they were really truthful in their claim to knowledge of the unseen, they would be right all the time, and they would have informed us the secrets of the Jews, and they could have uncovered all the buried treasures of the earth, and they would not be dependent on the people for money, taking their wealth from them under false pretenses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Defamation of Prophets nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This fourth category is the rejection of any of the messengers of Allâh or defaming their characters. These are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To deny the Message of Muhammed (pbuh) because the testimony that &#8216;Muhammed is the Messenger of Allâh&#8217; is one of the pillars of Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To disparage the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) or his truthfulness, or his faithfulness in discharge of what he was entrusted with, or his chasteness or to revile him or make fun of him, or make light of him, or find fault with any of his documented behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To attack his authentic Ahâdîth (transmitted sayings) and disbelieve them, or to reject the true news which he has described for us including his documented prophecies. Examples are the appearance of the Dajjâl (the Antichrist) or the descent of Jesus who will rule by the Sharî&#8217;ah of Muhammed (pbuh) and other prophecies documented in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. It is a nullification of Imân to reject these matters after accepting the attribution of the Ahâdîth to the Prophet (pbuh) as being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To deny any of the Messengers sent by Allâh before Muhammed (pbuh) or to deny the stories and sayings in regards to them and their nations, as reported in the Qur&#8217;ân or by the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) in authentic Ahâdîth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. To claim Prophethood after Muhammed (pbuh) for example Ghulam Ahmed, the Qâdiyâni (i.e. from Qadiyan, India), who claimed Prophethood, while the Qur&#8217;ân says in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammed (pbuh) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the Last (end) of the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (33:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the last one, after whom there will be no Prophet.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anyone who believes that there is a Prophet after Muhammed (pbuh) whether he is a Qâdiyâni (follower of the deviant heretic, Ghulâm Ahmad) or from any other group, he has disbelieved and nullified his Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. To describe the Prophet (pbuh) with attributes which belong to Allâh only, such as unlimited knowledge of the unseen, as some Sufis claim. One of their poets said:<br>
&#8220;Oh (total) knower of the unseen, we resorted to you; Oh curer of the hearts, blessing upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. To supplicate to the Prophet (pbuh) for what only Allâh has the power to bestow, such as supplicating for victory and help, cure of illness, etc., as is happening today among the Muslims, especially among the Sufis as their poet, Al-Busairy said:<br>
&#8220;Whoever asks by the Messenger of Allâh gets victory, even if a lion meets him in the forest;<br>
Never did time impose on me a hardship and I sought his protection except that I got his protection and no harm came to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This conception of the station of the Prophet (pbuh) is Shirk, contradicting the unequivocal announcement of the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And there is no victory except by the help of Allâh&#8230;&#8221; (8:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and contradicting the order of the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When you ask, ask from Allâh, and when you seek help, seek the help from Allâh.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what should we think about those who attribute to &#8220;saints&#8221; knowledge of the unseen, or make a Nadhr (a vow to give charity or perform some other optional good deed) for their sake, or dedicate animal sacrifices to them or ask of them what may only be requested of Allâh, such as sustenance or cure of illness, or victory, etc.? No doubt, these are Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We do not deny the miracles that appeared from the Messengers of Allâh nor those miraculous feets that came from the saints, but what we deny is making them partners with Allâh, supplicating them as we supplicate Allâh, and dedicating sacrifies to them, and undertaking a regime of optional worship for their sake. It has gotten to the point that the graves of some notable &#8220;saints&#8221; are showered with donations which are appropriated by the custodians and servants of these shrines, who then divide them among themselves, consuming people&#8217;s money under false pretenses. At the same time they are surrounded by multitudes of poor people who don&#8217;t get enough to eat for a day.<br>
One poet said: &#8220;Our living don&#8217;t even get a Dhirham (a coin of silver), while thousands and thousands go to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not all of these shrines and graves even contain the body of a saint. But swindlers erect some of them as a means of taking the money of the gullible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, one of my fellow teachers related to me that a certain Sufi Shaikh came to his mother&#8217;s house requesting a donation in order to erect a green flag to indicate the presence of a saint on a certain street, so she gave him some money. He bought some green cloth and fixed it to a wall and started telling people, &#8220;There is a Wali (saint) here, one of the friends of Allâh. I saw him in my dream.&#8221; And thus he started collecting money. One day the government decided to widen that street, which would require removing the grave. The man who had started the whole story started telling people that they had tried to remove it, but the equipment used had broken, and some people believed him, and this rumor started circulating, which caused the government to proceed with caution. The Mufti of that country himself told me that the government called him in the middle of the night to the site of that saint&#8217;s grave. He found it surrounded by soldiers. Then the excavator was brought and the grave was dug up. The Mufti looked inside and found nothing there, and knew the whole thing was a lie and fabrication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, which I heard from a teacher in the Haram in Makkah: One poor man met another and they complained to each other of their poverty. Then they saw a saint&#8217;s grave which was filled with welth. One said to the other: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s dig up a grave and put a saint in it, and the money will start rolling in.&#8221; His friend agreed, so they set out until they came to a braying donkey. They killed it and laid it to rest in a pit, they raised a mausoleum with a dome over it. And then both of them proceeded to roll around in the dust of the grave to get the Barakat (blessing) from it. When people passing by asked them what they were doing they said: &#8220;This is the grave of the saint Hubaish bin Tubaish, who worked miracles which defy description.&#8221; People were taking in by their spell and they began laying donations before the grave as charity and to fulfill vows, until they had gathered great wealth. When they started dividing it, they got into argument and started shouting at each other, which attracted a crowd of spectators. One of the two said: &#8220;I swear to you by this saint I didn&#8217;t take anything from you.&#8221; His friend said: &#8220;You swear to me by this saint while the both of us know there is a donkey in this grave that we buried together?&#8221; The people were astonished and felt foolish due to the donations they had made as vows, and took them back after beating the two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion&#8221;<br>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">From ad-Dawah illaah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most beautiful things about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feeling of love, fear and hope within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp, not least because every sect which has drifted from the Straight Path has strayed in the aspect of worship. The deviation of the other religions in this regard is clear for all to see: “God is love! Jesus is love!” say the Christians, denying the fact that Allah should be feared too. As for the Jews, their hearts were filled only with hope; hope that the Fire will never touch them, since they were the “Promised People”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Islaam however, no worship is complete without the presence of all three qualities: love of Allah, hope in His Mercy and fear of His Punishment. Contemplate the opening Soorah of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; Soorah al-Faatihah &#8211; and you will see this for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 1: “All praise [and thanks] is for Allah, Rabb of all the worlds.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this opening aayah (verse) of the Qur&#8217;aan, we have LOVE of Allah and every time we recite this aayah we are testifying to our love for Allah. How is that you ask?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is because in the aayah, we are acknowledging that Allah is our Rabb and the Rabb of all the worlds. Rabb is usually translated as ‘the Lord’, but this translation does not do justification to this name of Allah and all the meanings this name carries. In reality, Rabb means that Allah is the Creator of everything; He sustains and nourishes everything; He gives life and Death; anything good that we have is from Him; everything is dependant on Him and nothing can happen unless He wills it. Furthermore, for the Muslims He &#8211; the Rabb &#8211; in the One who has guided us to the Truth and given us good morals and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus when we testify that Allah is our Rabb, then we are acknowledging that He is the One who has given us so many blessings &#8211; so many that if we try to enumerate His blessings, we would be unable to do so. So how could we not but LOVE Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After all, we all love those who show kindness towards us or present us with gifts. And therefore the Messenger of Allah (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) encouraged the exchange of gifts between Muslims because it helps to strengthen ties and develop love for one another. He (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, “Give gifts to one another, you will come to love one another.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So imagine the LOVE we should have for our Rabb who has given us everything: nice families, shelter, security, food, health and above all the Guidance of Islaam and the Sunnah. We should be overwhelming in our love for Him. That is why we praise Him and thank Him and say, “All praise (and thanks) is for Allah, Rabbil-‘aalameen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 2: The Rahmaan (Merciful) and the Raheem (Mercy-Giving).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, Allah mentioned He was the Rabb. In this aayah two more of His beautiful names are mentioned: ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem. Ar-Rahmaan means that He is the Most Merciful. Ar-Raheem means that He is the Giver of Mercy, in other words His actions are full of Mercy and He shows Mercy to His creation.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we mention these two names of Allah, then we have HOPE. Since He is the One who is full of Mercy, and we hope He will forgive our mistakes and shortcomings. We should never loose hope, because Allah says in the Qur&#8217;aan, “O My slaves, who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, Verily Allah forgives all sins (except sins). Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful” [39: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The need to have FEAR in our worship is shown by the next aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 3: “King/Master of the Day of Judgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we recite this aayah, we remind ourselves of the Day of Judgement &#8211; that awful Day, when all of humanity shall stand before Allah … naked, uncircumcised and barefooted. People will appear drunk though they are not. On that Day, every person will stand before Allah and account for his sins, knowing that not even the smallest action which he did is hidden from Allah: “So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.” [Soorah 99 : 7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we recite this third aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, we remind ourselves of this Judgement and accountability and that should bring about in us a sense of fear &#8211; that maybe our evil actions will be too great and we will be responsible for them &#8211; May Allah protect us from such a fate. Then the next verse goes on to say: “You alone we worship.” i.e. we single out Allah for our worship. And how do we worship Him? With LOVE, HOPE and FEAR. And in order to achieve these qualities, we need Allah’s assistance, so we say then, “We seek Your Aid.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striking the Balance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After understanding the need to have love, hope and fear in our worship, the next question that naturally arises is that, in what proportion should these qualities be present in our worship? Again we turn to the Qur&#8217;aan for the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Call upon Him with Fear and Hope.” [ Soorah (7): 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in Fear and Hope.” [(32): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both fear and hope should be present in our hearts in equal proportions. Anas reported that the Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) entered upon a young boy who was dying. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) asked, “How are you?” The boy replied, “O Messenger of Allah, I am in between hoping in Allah and fearing for my sins.” The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, “The like of these two qualities do not unite in the heart of a servant except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and protects him from what he feared.”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore whenever we do a good action, we should hope that it has been accepted by Allah, but at the same time we should also have fear that maybe it isn’t enough or that the good deed has not been worthy of acceptance. Likewise when we sin, we should have hope that Allah will accept our repentance and forgive us, but we should also fear that we may be accountable for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This balance should be reflected in our Dawah (which of course is also worship). So when we invite others to the Truth, we should not give them the impression that ‘they have nothing to worry about’, nor do we suggest that ‘they are doomed forever’. Rather we couple warnings with encouragement. We inform them of the horrors of the Fire and tell them about the bliss of Paradise. Just as we find Allah telling us in the Qur&#8217;aan: “Verily your Lord is Quick in Punishment and verily He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Giver of Mercy.” [(7): 167]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars of Islaam say, “He who worships Allah with hope only is a murji’ee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And He who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [eg. the Soofis, the Christians, etc]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Mu’min [a believer upon Tawheed].”[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Murji’a were a sect that emerged within the first century of Islaam. The people of this sect (i.e. the murji’ees) believe that sins do not affect faith i.e. no matter what sins a person commits, his eeman (faith) is complete and perfect. They worship Allah only with hope because they believe that as long as one believed and testified to Islaam, they would enter Paradise regardless of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, all too often nowadays we find a similar attitude amongst many Muslims today, which is why we find that so often we try to advice someone to turn to the Deen and abandon sin, they just point to their hearts and say, “Allah knows what is in my heart”, or “Allah forgives”, or something else like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawaarij, they worshipped Allah in fear only because they held that anyone who commits major sins was a disbeliever and would therefore dwell in Hellfire forever. This of course is gross extremism and straying from the correct path. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: “There were two men of Banoo Israa’eel who strove equally. One of then committed sins and the other strove hard in worship. And the one who strove in worship cto see the other in sin and kept saying to him: “Desist.” So one day he found him committing a sin and so said to him: “Desist” So he replied, “Leave me by my Lord, have you been sent as a watcher over me?”. He said, “By Allah, Allah will not forgive you, nor will Allah admit you to Paradise”. Then their souls were taken and they came together before the Lord of the Worlds. So Allah said to the one who strove in worship: “Did you have Knowledge of Me, or did you have any power in what is in my Hands?” And He said to the sinner: “Go and enter Paradise through My Mercy.” And He said to the other: “Take him to the fire.” Aboo Hurairah t said: “By Him in whose Hand is my soul! He spoke a word which destroyed this world and the hereafter for him.”[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we should never say of anyone that he or she is a ‘lost cause’ or ‘doomed’ or the like for this is a great sin. However, we fear for those who commit major sins because they have been threatened with punishment in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth. However it is up to Allah whether He chooses to punish them or whether He will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Zindeeqs &#8211; or the heretics &#8211; are groups, such as many of the Soofis who have become like the Christians and reduced the religion to just ‘love’ and so all their talk and their mystical practices are centred around developing more ‘love’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear how imbalances in any of the three qualities of worship can lead to major deviation and straying to the True Guidance. It is therefore important for every Muslim to combine all three of them in his heart properly. As was mentioned before, the fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6], but as for love then that should be uppermost. As Fudayl ibn-‘Iyaad &#8211; rahimahullah &#8211; (d.187H) said, “The love is better than the fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us do what is prescribed with an open heart.”[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us what we hope for and protect us from what we fear. And may the Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammed, upon his family, his Companions and upon all those who follow Guidance until the Last Day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said that, when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hpoe should predominate &#8211; so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allah’s Mercy when terminally ill. [Al-Takhweef minan-Naar]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Reported in Al-Takhweef minan-Naar of Ibn Rajab. Note that some scholars hold that the fear is better than love, and Allah knows best.</p>

</b>Fataawaa Lajnatud-Daa&#8217;imah lil-Buhoothul `Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa, 3/185-187<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Newsletter, Issue No. 2, Safar 1417</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <em>eemaan</em> (faith?)…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise you to <strong>recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently</strong> and that you <strong>increase in your hearing</strong> of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of <em>Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to <strong>increase in the <em>dhikr</em></strong> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <em>subhaanallaah wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar</em> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as <em>al-Kalimut-Tayyib</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>al-Waabilus-Sayyib</em> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <em>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</em> and <em>al-Adhkaar</em> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility</span><b>.&#8221;</b><br>
[Soorah ar-Ra`d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong>preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations</strong> &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their eemaan (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: The Religion of Islam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the religion that Allah sent to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and made it the final and most complete religion for His slaves. Allah perfected, in this religion, the bounties that He bestowed on His salves, and accepts only Islam from them. He said, what translated means: <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of the Prophets.” </b>[33:40], <b>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam for you as your religion.”</b> [5:3], <b>“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.” </b>[3:19] and,<b> “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” </b>[3:85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah obligated all mankind to follow Islam:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is none who has the right to be worshipped but He; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allah and His Words (this Qur’aan, the Torah and the Gospel), and follow him so that you may be guided”</b> [7:158]. Abu Hurayrah (radhi allahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“By Whom the soul of Muhammad is in His Hand! No member of this nation, no Jew or Christian, hears of me and does not believe in what I was sent with, but he will be of the people of the Fire.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Messenger means </b> believing in what was revealed to him, coupled with acceptance and submission; without them the belief is not sufficient. This is why Abu Talib, the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) uncle, was not a believer in the Messenger, although he believed in what he was sent with and confirmed that Islam was the best religion, (but without acceptance or adherence to Islam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains all of what brings benefit</b>, which was also contained, in previous religions. Islam, however, is suitable for implementation anytime, anywhere and by any nation. Allah said to His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), what translated means, <b>“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it”</b> [5:48]. The meaning of “suitable for implementation at anytime, anywhere and by any nation,” is that Islam brings only benefit to mankind, whenever and wherever it is implemented. Islam is not under the control, and thus is not to be altered by, any nation living at any given time at any given place, as some people would want it to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam is the religion of truth.</b> It is the religion that Allah guaranteed aid and dominance for whoever firmly adheres by it. He said, what translated means, <b>“It is He who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) with guidance and the Religion of Truth (Islam), to make it superior over all religions even though the disbelievers hate it.” [9:33] </b>and,<b> “Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous, good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion, which He has chosen for them (Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (the believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the rebellious (disobedient to Allah).”</b> [24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains belief and Law: </b> It is a complete religion, both in its belief and in its Law. It demands from its followers the following:<br>
1 Believing in Taw’hid (Oneness) of Allah and disbelieving in Shirk (polytheism).<br>
2. Being truthful and not lying.<br>
3. Being just, that is to deal comparable things with equality, and abandoning injustice.<br>
4. Being honest and abandoning treachery.<br>
5. Preserving one’s promises and contracts and not breaking them.<br>
6. Being dutifully good to one’s parents and not cutting ties of kinship.<br>
7. Keeping relations with relatives and not cutting them.<br>
8. Being good with neighbors and not harming them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, Islam orders Muslims to have the best possible conduct and forbids all bad behavior. It requires Muslims to enjoin every righteous deed and avoid every evil deed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, Allah enjoins justice, Al-I&#8217;hsan (excellence in religion), giving (help) to kith and kin, and forbids all evil (deeds), Al-Munkar (all that is prohibited) and injustice. He admonishes you, that you may take head)’</b> [16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="2"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 2: The Pillars of Islam and Eeman</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Pillars of Islam are the cornerstones on which Islam is built.</b> There are five pillars of Islam. They are mentioned in the Hadeeth of ibn Omar (radiyallaahu anhuma), that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, ‘Islam is built around five (pillars):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. </b>The testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger,<br>
<b>2.</b> To establish prayer,<br>
<b>3.</b> To give Zakaat (obligatory charity),<br>
<b>4.</b> To fast in Ramadhan, and,<br>
<b>5.</b> To perform Hajj (pilgrimage).” [Saheeh Muslim and Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The Shahadah (the testimony) </b> that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, requires solid belief, in the heart, in it. This belief must also be confirmed by the tongue. It is called Shahadah (testimony) to show that when a believer believes in it, his belief is as solid as if he is an eyewitness. This Shahadah is one cornerstone, although it contains many aspects that must be taken as belief. This testimony (comprised of two testimonies as is apparent), is considered one cornerstone, either because it contains testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is only a conveyer of the Message from Allah and His slave and Messenger, thus completing the testimony that Allah is One or because these two testimonies together are the reason behind the acceptance of deeds by Allah. Deeds are neither valid nor accepted unless they are done with sincerity for the sake of Allah alone, and this is called “Ikhlas,” and through following the way of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realizing the essence of this testimony, that there is no god except Allah, is a result of Ikhlas (sincerity) to Allah. Realizing the essence of testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, comes as a result of following the Messenger of Allah. This magnificent testimony leads to many sweet results. It frees the hearts and souls from being enslaved to the creation and from following other than the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Establishing the prayers </b> means to worship Allah by praying to Him. One must preserve the prayers by establishing them on time and in the best manner, as taught by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). Rewards for establishing the prayers include tranquility and happiness that are felt in the heart. Prayer also leads one to abandoning evil deeds and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. Paying Zakat </b> is worshipping Allah by paying the amount of charity obligated on the ones who have enough money or possessions that require paying Zakat. Paying the required Zakat leads to cleansing the heart from the evil of misery. It also fulfills the needs of Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. Fasting Ramadhan</b> contains worshipping Allah by fasting during the days of this month, by not eating or drinking from dawn to sunset. Fasting trains the souls to abandon what is preferred and desired, seeking the pleasure of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. Performing Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah)</b> is worshipping Allah by visiting the Holy House to perform the rituals of Hajj. Hajj trains the souls to spend time and physical effort, seeking to obey Allah. This is why Hajj is considered a type of Jihad (struggle).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> These fruits of performing the pillars of Islam</b>, along with many others we did not mention, make the Muslim nation pure and clean. They lead the nation to preserving the religion of Truth and dealing with the creation in the best manners of justice and truthfulness. All other acts of the religion depend on how well these pillars are preserved. The Ummah (Muslim nation) can reach success as long as its members preserve the religion. This Ummah will not reach the desired success as long as the religion is not fully respected and preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Whoever wants to be certain of the above-mentioned facts</b>, let him read the following Ayat (verses), “And if the people of the towns had believed and had piety, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings form the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (of evil deeds). Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they play? Did they then feel secure against the plot of Allah? None feels secure form the plot of Allah except the people who are lost” [7:96-99]. Let him also read the history of previous nations, which gives valuable lessons for whoever is in possession of a mind that comprehends and is rightly guided. This history is a light for those whose hearts are not blocked from the truth. All our dependence is on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Pillars of Islamic Belief<br>
</b> Islam, as we explained before, is belief and Laws. We mentioned some pillars of the Laws. These pillars are the basis of Islamic Law. As for the Islamic ‘Aqeedah (creed), its pillars are: Believing in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the good or bad that Qadar (predestination) brings. These pillars are mentioned in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Righteousness is not that you (only) turn your faces towards the East and (or) the West (in prayers); but righteousness is (the quality) of the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets” </b>[2:177], and with regards to Qadar, <b>“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar. And Our Commandment is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.” </b>[54:49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Sunnah, the Messenger of Allah said, in answer to Gibreel when he asked him about Iman (belief), <b>“Iman is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in the Qadar and what it brings of good or bad.” </b>[ Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="3"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 3: The Belief in Allah</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Existence Allah’s existence is affirmed through Fitrah </b>(the innate purity that Allah creates in every human being), the Mind, the Shari’ah (Islamic Law) and the senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> a) As for the Fitrah,</b> we say the following: Allah created the belief in Him in every human being. Mankind needs not to be taught this belief or think about how to possess it. However, the ones who have this Fitrah corrupted will not benefit from it. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Every newly born will be born having Fitrah. However, his parents will either convert him to Judaism, Christianity or Majocism (fire worshipping).” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> b) The Human Mind </b> must be used to prove the existence of Allah. All this creation, of old and new, must have a Creator who invented and started it. This creation could not have come to existence on its own or by chance. It could not have created itself, because it did not exist beforehand. Therefore, how can it create? Also, the creation could not have been started by accident or chance. Everything that exists must have a Creator who brought it into existence. Creation is magnificent in organization, coherent and correlated in its existence. There is a reason and originator behind every act. All this nullifies the saying that this entire universe was started by chance. What was started by chance cannot be organized in its form because it did not have any organization before it was formed. What makes what was created by chance to be this organized? If all this creation neither could have created itself nor was it created by chance, then it must have an Originator, Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah mentioned this reasoning in the Quran, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?”</b> [52:35].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means that men were neither created without a Creator nor did they create themselves. Therefore, Allah is the One who created them. This is why when Jubair ibn Mut’im (radiyallaahu anhu) heard the Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) recite this Surah until he reached, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. Or are with them the Treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with authority to do as they like?”</b> [52:35-37],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jubair, a disbeliever then, said, <b>“My heart almost flew (from the power of this reasoning mentioned in the Surah). This was the first time that Iman entered my heart.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> c) &#8211; As for the Shari’ah</b>, all divine religions testify to the fact that Allah created the world. All Laws that were sent with these divine and revealed religions contain what benefits mankind. This is evidence to the existence of a Wise and All-Knowing Lord Who knows what brings benefit to His creation, All divinely-revealed religions describe a universe that is self evident to the existence and ability of Allah, Who Creates what He Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> d) &#8211; Also, the senses must be used</b> to prove the existence of Allah. We know that Allah accepts the supplication from whoever seek His aid and help, and that He brings them the benefits that they desire. This is clear evidence to the existence of Allah, who said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime We listened to his invocation.” </b>[21:76] and, <b>“(Remember) when you sought help from your Lord and He answered you?”</b> [8:9].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Malik (radhi allahu anhu) said, “An Arabian (Bedouin) man entered (the Masjid) on Friday while the Prophet was delivering the speech. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! (Our) possessions are destroyed, (our) children are hungry. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands in supplication (to Allah). All of a sudden, mountain-like clouds were formed. He did not descend from his Minbar (the podium) until I saw rain falling through his beard. On the second Friday, this Arabian man, or someone else, stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), Buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands and said: <b>‘O my Lord! Around us and not on us.’</b> Wherever he pointed to an area (of the sky), they (the clouds) dispersed.” [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s acceptance of supplication has been and still is a known matter until today. It is given to those who are true in their seeking refuge in Allah and perform supplication in the correct manner to ensure its acceptance. Also, there are the signs that Allah gave His Prophets, which are called miracles. People witnessed or heard these miracles. They are clear evidence that the One who sent the Messengers exists, and He is Allah the All Mighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These miracles are activities that are beyond the capability of mankind. Allah gave them to His Messengers as a way of aiding them and giving them victory. An example of these miracles is the sign given of Moses. Allah ordered him to strike the sea with his stick, and the sea parted into twelve separate pads between mountains of water on each side of these parts, <b>“Then We inspired Moses (saying): “Strike the sea with your stick. And it parted, and each separated part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.” [26:63]. Another example is the miracle of Jesus. He was given the power by Allah to raise the dead from their graves and back into life. Allah said about him, what translated means, “And I bring the dead to life by Allah’s leave.”</b> [3:49] and, <b>“And when you (O Jesus) brought forth the dead by My Permission.”</b> [5:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third example is the miracle Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) performed. His tribe, Quraysh, asked him to perform a miracle. He pointed to the moon and it separated into two parts while his people were witnessing the incident. Allah said about this miracle, what translated means, <b>“The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away, and say: “This is continuous magic.”</b> [54:1-2].[4] All these miracles, that Allah gave to His Messengers as an aid and victory and that were witnessed by their nations, are proof that Allah exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Lordship</b> This means to believe that Allah is the Lord, alone, and that He has no partners or helpers. The Rabb (Lord) is the One who Creates and Commands. There is no creator except Allah and there is no owner of the universe except Him. The Commandment and the Control is His. He said, what translated means, <b>“Surely, His is the Creation and commandment.”</b> [7:54] and, <b>“Such is Allah your Lord; His is the Kingdom. And those whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the membrane over the date-stone).&#8221;</b> [35:13]. Only a few people rejected Allah’s Lordship. These are the arrogant ones who deny what they believe deep in their hearts. This happened from Pharaoh, when he said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“I am your lord, most high.”</b> [79:24] and, <b>“O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me!”</b> [28:38].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what he said was not his true belief. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And they belied them (Our Signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof” </b>[27:14].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Moses said to Pharaoh, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b>”Verily, you know that these Signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear (evidences of His Oneness and Might). And I think you are, indeed, O Pharaoh, doomed to destruction.”</b> [17:102]. The Arab disbelievers of old used to confirm Allah’s Lordship, although they associated others with Him in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Say: “Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein? If you know!” They will say: “It is Allah’s!” Say: “Will you not then remember?” Say: “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?” They will say: “Allah.” Say: “Will you not then fear Allah?” Say: “In Whose Hands is the sovereignty of everything? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, if you know?” They will say: “(All this belongs) to Allah.” Say: “How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?)&#8221;</b> [23:84-89],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed if you ask them: <b>“Who has created the heavens and the earth?” They will surely say: “The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.” </b>[43:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah.” How then are they turned away (from His worship)”</b> [43:87].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah’s order comprises of both, His running of the universe and the Commandment.</b> He is the One who controls the creation and the One who does what He will, according to His Wisdom. He is also the One who gives the Commandment organizing aspects of worship and dealings, according to His Wisdom. Whoever takes anyone, besides Allah, to be the one who commands acts of worship or types of dealings, will have committed Shirk (disbelief, association in worship) with Allah. This act negates Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; The Belief That He Is the ILAH: </b> Allah is the Ilah, meaning He is the Worshipped One Who has no partners. This Ilah is worshipped with love and reverence. He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord is One Lord, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.”</b> [2:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He, and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b>[3:18].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All things that are taken as gods, besides Allah, are false gods, <b>“That is because Allah is the Truth (the Only True God), and what they (the disbelievers) invoke besides Him, it is falsehood. And verily, Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.”</b> [22:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To call these things “gods,” does not make them gods. Allah said about some idols, Al-Lat, Al-’Uzzaa and Manat, <b>“They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority&#8221; </b>[53:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yousef (Joseph) said to his two companions in jail, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b> “Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah the One, the Irresistible? You do not worship beside Him but only names, which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.”</b> [12:39-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Messengers used to say to their nations, <b>“Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him.” </b>[23:23]. However, the disbelievers refused to accept this call. They took others as gods besides Allah. They worshipped them besides Allah, calling them when aid and help were needed. Allah refuted the disbelievers in their taking these idols as gods besides Him, using two logical arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first argument:</b> These idols, that were taken by the disbelievers as gods, do not have any attributes that qualify them to be gods. These false gods were created and do not create. They can neither bring about benefit for whoever worships them, nor can they fend harm off. They cannot give life or take it away. They neither own nor are they partners in the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Yet, they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead)&#8221;</b> [25:3],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call upon those whom you asset (to be associate gods) besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of an atom, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor they have any share in either, nor is there for Him any supporter from among them.” </b> [34:22-23] and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</b> [7:191-192].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the case with false gods, then taking them as gods is a true misguidance and the lowest of all acts. The second argument: The Mushrikeen (polytheists) are among those who confirmed that Allah, alone, is the Lord, the Creator, the One Who Has the ownership of everything and the One Who gives protection and no one can give protection to anyone from His Might. This confirmation requires from these disbelievers to worship Allah alone. He said, what translated means, <b>“O Mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).”</b> [2:21-22],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah&#8221;.</b> <b>How then are they turned away (from His worship)?” </b>[43:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Say (O Muhammad): “Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?” They will say: ‘Allah.” “Say: “Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment?” Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the Truth, what else can there be, save error? How then are you mined away?</b> [10:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; The Belief In Allah’s Names and Attributes. </b> This belief requires accepting whatever Allah described of Himself in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). The Names and Attributes must be accepted without alteration <b> [1]</b>, rejection <b> [2]</b>, and precise description of their true nature or equating them with attributes of the creation. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who deny His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.”</b> [7:180],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b> [30:27] and, <b>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All Seer.”</b> [42:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups have fallen into misguidance concerning this matter:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> One of them is Al-Mu’attilah (the refuters). </b> This group rejected the Names and Attributes, or some of them, claiming that to accept them is to equate Allah with His creation. This claim is false for many reasons following are two of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b> This claim leads to false conclusions that Allah’s Words are in Opposition to each other. Allah is the One who confirmed these Names and Attributes and denied that there is anything that resembles Him. If confirming these Names and Attributes leads to equating Allah with the creation, then this will lead to the conclusion that Allah’s Words are full of discrepancies and refute each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> For two things to have an attribute of some kind, does not mean that they are equal or look-likes. One can witness two persons who are both called “a human who hears, sees and speaks.” However, this description of both does not mean that they are of equal capabilities in their hearing, sight or speech. One can also see that animals have hands, legs and eyes. However, this does not mean that animals are equal in every respect with regards to their hands, legs and eyes. If disparity is this wide between that which creation possess of attributes or names, then the disparity between the Creator and creation is even greater and more evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The second misguided group is called “Al- Mushabbihah.”</b> They confirmed the Names and the Attributes. Yet, they equated them with the names and attributes of the creation. They claimed that this is what the Texts mean. They claimed that Allah reveals to His slaves what they can comprehend. This claim is false for many reasons, some of them are: Allah’s resemblance with His creation is false and is refuted with the mind and the Laws of Shari’ah. Texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah cannot lead to falsehood in their meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed what His slaves can understand of the general meaning. However, the true nature of what these meanings are like is a knowledge that only Allah possesses, especially with regards to the true nature of His Names and Attributes. Allah confirmed that He is the All-Hearer. Hearing means to comprehend sounds. However, the true nature of Allah’s Hearing is unknown. Creation vary in their hearing capability. The difference between Allah’s Hearing and the hearing of creation is even greater and more evident. Also, Allah confirmed that He Istawa (Mounted or Settled) on His Throne. To mount and settle on a throne is known in the general meaning of the word “mounted,” or “settled.” The true nature of Allah’s mounting on His Throne is unknown. Mounting on something varies with regards to different creation. To mount on a chair is unlike mounting on a wild camel. If Istiwaa’ is this different between creation, then how can the Istiwaa’ of Allah be compared to the Istiwaa’ of creation? The difference between them is greater and more evident. Benefits of Believing in Allah, in the way described above, leads to many benefits for the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b>To truly realize the Taw’hid of Allah, by depending only on Him and hoping in, fearing and worshipping Him alone.<br>
<b>2.</b> To prefect one’s love and reverence of Allah, and according to His Might as described by His Most-Beautiful Names and Most-High Attributes.<br>
<b>3.</b> To truly give one’s worship to Allah, by adhering to His Commandments and abandoning His Prohibitions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [1]</b> TAAWEEL &#8211; Introducing change in a statement, leaving out the meaning understood by it, expressing and accepting such a meaning which the words may indicate in a doubtful sense. In the present context (i.e. Attributes of Allaah) it means rejecting the true meaning of Attributes of Allaah, as understood by the companions (radiyallaahu anhum), and giving preferences to one own understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [2]</b> TA’TEEL (Rejecting,Leaving or Vacating). It means negating the Attributes of Allaah and denying them with His Self. The difference between Taqweel and Ta’teel is that in the latter case the real meaning is denied which is proved by the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadith. While in Tahreef the explanation of the text is done with such meanings that are false and the word does not prove them. So Ta’teel includes Tahreef. Wherever there is Tahreef, Ta’teel is certainly there, but the reverse is not true. If someone tries to prove the false meaning and denies the real meaning, he is committing both Ta’teel and Tahreef</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 4: Belief In The Angels</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Angels are a matter of the unseen. </b> They are created by Allah and they worship Him. They have no attributes that qualify them to be gods or lords. Allah created them from light, and He bestowed on them the bounty of obeying Him at all times. He gave them the power to carry and implement His orders, <b>“And those who are near Him (the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so).”</b> [21:19-20]. They are so numerous that only Allah can count their numbers. Anas (radiyallaahu anhu) said, while narrating the story of the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ascension to heaven, that Al-Bait Al-Ma’amoor (the House in heaven that is always inhabited. It is, for the inhabitants of heaven, like the Kaa’bah for the people of earth) was raised for the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) in heaven so he can see it. Each day, seventy thousand Angels pray in this House, and when they exit from it, they will never get back into it (this shows how numerous the angels are).[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Angels Has three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belief in their existence.<br>
Belief in what we were told of their names, such as Jibreel, and also belief in other angels whom we were not informed of their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Belief in what we were told of their attributes.</b> The example to this is the description of Jibreel. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) told us that he saw Jibreel in the shape that Allah created him, having six hundred wings and larger than the horizon. The angels may change their shapes, by the order of Allah. They may take the shape of men. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam (Mary) and he came to her in the shape of a man. He was also sent to Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), while he was sitting down with his companions, in the shape of a man, wearing very white clothes with very dark hair, a stranger to the companions, yet no evidence of traveling was apparent on him. He sat next to the Prophet and laid his knees next to the Prophet’s knees and put his hands on the Prophet’s thighs. He asked the Prophet about Islam, Iman, Ih’san (excellence in the religion) and the Last Hour and its signs. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) answered him. Then, Jibreel left. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions, <b> “This was Jibreel, He came to you to teach you your religion.” </b>[Saheeh Muslim popularly known as the HADEETH of JIBREEL]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah sent the angels to Ibrahim (Abraham) and Lut in the shape of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in the tasks that they perform, by the order of Allah.</b> They praise Allah and worship him at all times without the slightest boredom or fatigue. Some angels may have special tasks to fulfill, a few have been mentioned below;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel is the honorable angel, whom Allah sends down with revelation to the Prophets and Messengers. Mikaeel is the angel who is controlling rain and Vegetation by the order of Allah. Israfeel is the angel who must blow in the Horn when the Hour (Last Day) has started and when it is time to resurrect the dead. An angel is the keeper and supervisor of Hell. The Angel of death captures the souls at death. There are angels who supervise fetuses in the wombs. When a fetus is four months old, Allah sends down an angel and orders him to record the fetus’s sustenance, maximum age, deeds and if miserable (destined to Hell) or happy (destined to Paradise). There are angels who record deeds of mankind. They have a record of everyone’s deeds. There are two angels for each person, one to the right and the other to the left. There are other angels who question the dead when they are in their graves. Two angels come to all dead persons and ask each one of them about the Lord he worshipped, the religion he followed and the Messenger he obeyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing In The Angels<br>
1.</b> Knowing Allah’s Might, Strength and Power. All the strength of creation is a sign of the Strength of the Creator.<br>
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah because He takes care of mankind. He appointed angels to protect them, record their deeds and other beneficial tasks.<br>
<b>3.</b> Loving the angels because they are true worshippers of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject that the angels exist in a physical form. </b>They claim that the angels are the potential for good that creation possesses. This is a direct rejection to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means: <b>“All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the (Only) Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made the Angels messengers with wings, two or three or four).&#8221; </b>[35:1], <b>“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death), they smite their faces and their backs.”</b> [8:50], <b>“And if you could but see when the unjust (disbelievers) are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls.”</b> [6:93], <b>“Until when fear is banished from their (the angels’) hearts, they (the angels) say: “What is that your Lord has said?” They say: “The Truth. “And He is the Most High, the Most Great” [34:23] and, “And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): ‘Peace be upon you for that you preserved in patience! Excellent indeed is the final Home (</b><b>Paradise).”</b> [13:23-24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“When Allah likes a slave, He calls on Jibreel, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, Gibreal loves him. Afterwards, Jibreel calls on the inhabitants of heaven, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, the people of heaven love him. Afterwards acceptance (among the community of believers) will be granted for him in earth.”[3] and, “When the day of Friday comes, there stand angels at each of the Masjid’s doors. They record the first then the next (one to come to the Masjid). When the Imam sits down (waiting for the call to prayer to end so he can start the speech), they close the books and they come to listen to the Thikr (the remembrance of Allah contained in the Friday speech).”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above texts are clear in their meaning that the angels have physical forms and are not a state of the mind, as the misguided claim. The true meaning of these texts, which states that the angels exist in a physical form, is accepted by the entire Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="5"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 5: Belief In The Books</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kutub (books) is plural for Kitab (a book). They are called Kutub because they are written (maktoob). Books, here means the Books that Allah sent down to His Messengers as a mercy and guidance for mankind. These Books are designed to lead mankind to what brings them happiness in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> There are four aspects of believing in the Books<br>
1.</b> To believe that they are truly sent down by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> To believe in the Books that mankind were informed of, like the Qur’aan, sent down to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Torah, sent down to Moses, the Injeel (the Gospel), sent down to Jesus and the Zaboor (the Psalms), sent down to David. We also believe in the other Books, sent down by Allah, even though we do not know their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> To believe in whatever the Books contained, like whatever is contained in the Qur’aan and sections of previous Books that have not been corrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.</b> To implement the Commandments contained in these Books, unless Allah commanded to the contrary through Naskh (over ruling). We must accept whatever these Books contained of Commandments, even if we do not know the wisdom behind them. All previous Books were over-ruled by the Qur’aan. Allah said, what translated means, “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it.” [5:48]. This means that the Qur’aan is dominant over all other Books. Therefore, no Commandment contained in other than the Qur’aan can be implemented unless it is in agreement with the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Books<br>
1.</b> Knowing that Allah takes care of His slaves by sending down Books for their guidance.<br>
<b>2.</b> Knowing Allah’s Wisdom in whatever He commands. He commanded each nation with what is suitable for them, <b>“To each among you, We have prescribed a Law and a </b><b> Clear Way.” </b> [5:48].<br>
<b>3.</b> Thanking Allah for His bounties, because He sent down these Books to lead mankind to guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="6"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 6: Belief In the Messengers</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are sent to deliver a Message. </b> They are the ones to whom Allah has sent down revelation and who conveys His Law to mankind. Allah ordered them to deliver these Messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first Messenger to be sent was Noah and the last one was Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). </b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, We have inspired you (O Muhammad) as We inspired Noah and the Prophets after him.”</b> [4:163]. Anas ibn Malik (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, during his Hadeeth about Shafa’ah (the right of intercession on mankind’s behalf that Allah grants to His Messenger on the Last Day), “Mankind come to Adam to intercede on their behalf but he declines, saying: <b>‘Go to Noah, the First Messenger that Allah sent&#8230;” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee] Also, Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of Prophets.”</b> [33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah sent Messengers to every nation and provided them with Laws that their nations must follow. </b> Some Messengers were sent to revive a Message of a previous Messenger. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (alone), and avoid all Taghut (false deities).”</b> [16:36], <b>“And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them).&#8221;</b> [35:24] and, <b>“Verily, We did send down the Torah (to Moses), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s will, judged the Jews.”</b> [5:44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are only humans and they do not possess any attributes that qualify them to be gods. </b> Allah described His Messenger, Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), the master of all Messengers and the best of mankind, saying, what translated means, <b>“Say (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam): “I possess no power of benefit or harm to myself except as Allah will. If I had the knowledge of the Unseen, I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</b> [7:188] and, <b>“Say (O Muhammad):</b> <b>“It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.” Say: (O Muhammad): “None can protect me from Allah ‘s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</b> [72:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messengers are only humans. They get sick and they die, they need to eat and drink and they have other human needs. Abraham described his Lord, saying, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again).”</b> [26: 79-81]. Also, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“I am only human, just like you, I forget as you forget, therefore, when I forget, remind me.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah described the Messengers, while praising them, that they reached the highest attainable degrees in worshipping Him.</b> He said about Noah, what translated means, <b>“Verily, he was a grateful slave.”</b> [17:3], and about Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), <b>“Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion (of right and wrong, this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) that he may be a Warner to the ‘Alamin (Mankind and the Jinn).”</b> [25:1], and about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <b>“And remember Our slaves, Abraham Isaac and Jacob, (all) owners of strength (in worshipping Us) and (also) of religious understanding. Verily, We did choose them by granting them the Remembrance of the home (in the Hereafter). And they are in Our Sight, verily, of the </b><b> Chosen and the Best.”</b> [38:45-47], and about Jesus, <b>“He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of </b><b> Israel.”</b> [43:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Messengers Has Four Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> To believe that the Messages are truly from Allah. Whoever disbelieves in one Messenger, will have disbelieved in all Messengers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The people of Noah belied the Messengers.”</b> [26:105]. Allah considered the people of Noah disbelievers in all Messengers, although they only disbelieved in one Messenger. Therefore, the Christians, who disbelieve in Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) and do not follow him, are disbelievers in Jesus, the Son of Mary. Jesus gave the glad tidings of the coming of Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to the Christians. This glad tidings will be of no benefit to the Christians if they do not follow Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to guidance and the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> To believe in the Messengers whom we were told about, like Muhammad (sallallaau alaihi wa-sallam), Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Noah (alaihum as-salam). These are the five strongest Messengers. Allah mentioned them in two verses of the Qur’aan, <b>“And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their Covenant, and form you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and from Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, son of Mary.”</b> [33:7] and, <b>“He (Allah) has ordained for you the same Religion (Islam) which He ordained for Noah, and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and that which We ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus, saying you should establish Religion (by implementing the Commandments) and make no divisions in it.”</b> [42:13]. We must also believe in all other Messengers and Prophets whom their names were not mentioned to us, <b>“And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)), of them some We have related to you their story and some We have not related to you their story.” </b>[40:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> To believe in all what the Messengers have conveyed to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. </b>To implement the Laws of the Messenger who was sent to us, Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the final Messenger. Allah sent Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) to all mankind, <b>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</b> [4:65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Messengers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> Knowing how Allah takes care of His slaves by sending them Messengers to guide them to His Path. The Messengers teach their nations how to worship Allah, because the human mind cannot know how Allah should be worshipped without guidance from Him.<br>
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah for this great bounty.<br>
<b>3.</b> Dutifully loving, respecting and praising the Messengers of Allah. They are Allah’s Messengers; they worshipped Him, conveyed His Message and gave the best advice to His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Many rebellious people rejected their Messengers, claiming that Allah’s Messengers cannot be human.</b> Allah mentioned this claim and refuted it, <b>“And nothing prevented men from believing when the Guidance came to them, except that they said: “Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger?” Say: “If there were on the earth, angels walking about, in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.””</b> [17:94- 95]. Allah refuted this claim, saying that the Messengers must be sent from among humans, because they are sent to the people of earth, who are humans. If the inhabitants of earth were angels, then Allah would have sent Messengers from among the angels to them. Allah mentioned what the disbelievers in the Messengers said, <b>“You are no more than, human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority (a clear sign that supports what you say).” Their Messengers said to them: “We are no more than human beings like you, but Allah bestows His grace to whom He will of His salves. it is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the permission of Allah.”</b> [14:10-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="7"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 7: Belief In the Last Day</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Last Day is the Day when mankind will be resurrected to be asked about their deeds and receive reward or punishment for them. It is called “the Last Day,” because it is the last day, no day after that. Afterwards, people of Paradise will permanently reside and take their places in it, and people of Hell will permanently reside and take their places in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Last Day Has Three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in the Resurrection. &#8211; The Resurrection happens when the Horn will be blown for the second time. Afterwards, mankind will be resurrected to face the questioning by the Lord of the worlds. They will neither be wearing shoes nor circumcised, and they will be naked and visible to others on this state, (however, everyone will be absolutely preoccupied with what they are going to face and the hardship of the Day of Resurrection). Allah said, what translated means, <b>“As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.&#8221; </b>[21:104].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Resurrection is a true event that the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims have confirmed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“After that, surely you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.”</b> [23:15-16]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“On the Day of Resurrection, Mankind wilt be resurrected while they are bear-footed and naked.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are unanimous on confirming the Day of Resurrection. This is the wisdom of Allah, for He decreed that creation will have a day of reckoning for their deeds after He sent them Messengers to inform them of His Commandments. He said, what translated means, <b>“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?”</b> [23:115] and, <b>“Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Qur’aan will surely bring you back to the Ma’ad (place of return).”</b> [28:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. To believe in the Reckoning</b> &#8211; In the Last Day, the slave will be rewarded or punished for his deeds. This fact was also confirmed by the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, to Us will be their return. Then verily, for Us will be their Reckoning.” </b>[88:25-26], <b>“Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed shall have only the recompense of the like thereof and they will not be wronged.” [6:160] and, “And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it And Sufficient are We as Reckoners.”</b> [21:47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Allah will bring the believer closer to Him, and will shield him form being exposed (for his evil deeds in front of everyone). He will say: ‘Do you remember such and such (evil) deed? Do you remember such and such (evil) deed?’ He will say: ‘Yes, O my Lord!’ When He gets his confessions for his evil deeds, and he (the salve) thinks that he is close to destruction, he will say: ‘I have preserved you (from being exposed in front of others for these evil deeds) during your lifetime. Today, I forgive them for you.’ Then, he will be given his record of deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, they will be called in public: ‘These are the ones who lied on their Lord (did not follow His Guidance sent down with their Prophets). Therefore, Allah’s curse will befall the unjust ones.&#8221; </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And,“<b>Whoever intends to perform a good deed, and performs it, Allah will record it for him as ten deeds, to seven hundredfold, to many more folds. Whoever intends to commit and evil deed, and commits it, Allah will record it as one evil deed.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Muslims are unanimous that the Day of Reckoning will come.</b> This is the Wisdom of Allah. He revealed the Books, sent down the Messengers and commanded that they be accepted, followed and obeyed. He commanded that whoever oppose them (the Books and the Messengers) are to be fought. He permitted shedding their blood, and the seizure of their children, women and possessions. If there will not be a Day of Reckoning, then this Commandment will be time wasted. Allah is immune form such joyful play. <b>“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to who it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers. Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (their whole story) with knowledge, and indeed We were not absent.’</b> [7:6.7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. To believe in Paradise and Hell. </b> They are the final destination for whoever deserves either one of them, and for eternity. Paradise is the destination of the ultimate happiness and joy that Allah prepared for the believers who feared Him, believed in what He required from them to believe and obeyed Him and His Messenger. They are the ones who were sincere to Allah and followers of His Messenger. Paradise contains, of Allah’s bounties, <b>“What no eye has ever violated, what no ear has ever heard of and what no mind has ever imagined (of joys that Allah hid for the believers).” </b>[4] Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who believe (in Allah) and do righteous, good deeds, they are the best of creatures. Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eternity, underneath which rivers flow, they will abide therein forever, Allah Well-Pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.” </b>[98:7-8] and, <b>“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)’</b> [32:17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Hell, it is the destination of torment and punishment that Allah prepared for the unjust disbelievers. They are the ones who disbelieved in Him and disobeyed His Messengers. Hell contains kinds of punishment and torment that no one could ever imagine. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And fear the Fire, which is prepared for the disbelievers.”</b> [3: 131] “We have prepared for the wrongdoers, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them. And if they ask for help (relief, water etc.) they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their faces. Terrible the drink, and an evil dwelling.” [18: 29] and,<b> “Verily, Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell). Wherein, they will abide forever, and they will find neither a protector nor a helper. On the Day when their faces will be turned and rolled form all sides in the Fire, they will say: “Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger (Muhammad).”</b> [33:64-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Life After Death</b>: Believing in the Last Day requires Muslims to also believe in life after death and in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The questioning in the grave. </b> The dead will be asked, in their graves, about the lord, the religion and the Prophet they followed during their lifetime. <b>Allah will lead the believer to say what is necessary, saying, “Allah is my Lord. My religion is Islam. My Prophet is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).” As for the unjust, Allah will lead him to misguidance saying, in answer to the above questions “What! What! I do not know.” Also! the hypocrites and the ones who always had doubts about Allah, the religion and the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), will say, “I do not know. I heard people say something and I followed them.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. The torment or joy in the grave.</b> The unjust, the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be tormented in their graves. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And if you but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls; this day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject his Ayat (proofs, signs, evidences, etc.) with disrespect”</b> [6: 93] and about Pharaoh’s people, “The Fire; they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels):<b> “Cause Pharaoh ‘s people to enter the severest Torment” </b>[40:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid ibn Thabit (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions what translated means, <b>“I would have asked Allah to let you hear what I am hearing from the punishment in the grave, but for the fear that you would not bury each other after that”</b> Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) turned his face towards them, saying, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah).” They said, “We seek refuge lit Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Da.jjal.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for joys of the grave, they are given to the believers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah (alone),” and then they stood fast on them (these words that they say), on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of </b><b> Paradise which you have been promised?” </b> [41:30] and, <b>“Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat? And you at the moment are looking on? But We (our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not. Then why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense (punishment). Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful? Then if he (the dying person) be of those near ones (close to Allah), (there is for him) rest and provisions, and a </b><b> Garden of Delights (Paradise).&#8221;</b> [56: 83-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Azib narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said about the believer, that <b>after he is asked by the angels (about the lord, the religion and the Messenger he followed) and after he replies (saying that his Lord is Allah, his religion is Islam and his Messenger is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), “A caller from heaven will say: ‘My slave has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him (his grave) from </b><b> Paradise, dress him from Paradise and open a door for him to Paradise.” Then he said, “He will receive from its tranquility and perfume. His grave will be enlarged for him the distance that his sight reaches.” </b> [Musnad Ahmad &amp; Aboo Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing in the Last Day<br>
1.</b> The desire to do righteous, good deeds, seeking the good results in the Last Day.<br>
<b>2.</b> The fear from committing and approving of evil deeds, fearing the torment of the Day of Reckoning.<br>
<b>3.</b> The believer feels that this belief makes him forget the hardships he faces in this life. He is preoccupied with working righteousness trying to reach the joys and good rewards of the Last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some disbelievers reject the idea of life after death saying</b> that this is not possible. This claim is false. Religion, the senses and the mind are used to refute this claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Religion, Allah said, what translated means: <b>“The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the account). Say (O Muhammad): “Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed (and recompensed for) what you did, and that is easy for Allah.”</b> [64:7] All Scriptures are unanimous on this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, Allah demonstrated to his slaves how He raised the dead in this life. In Surat Al-Baqarah. Allah mentioned five examples:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The People of Moses said to him, <b>“We will no believe in you unless we see Allah without a barrier.” They were seized by death and then Allah resurrected them. To remind the Children of </b><b> Israel with this story, Allah said, what translated means, “And (remember) when you said: “O Moses: We shall never believe in you till we see Allah Plainly.” But you were seized with a thunder-bolt (lightening) while you were looking. Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.” [</b>2:55-56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> The story of the murdered man whom the Children of Israel differed as to who killed him. Allah ordered them to sacrifice a cow and strike him with some of its parts. so he can tell them who killed him, <b>“And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were hiding. So We said: “Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow).” Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand.”</b> [2:72-73].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> The story of the nation that escaped from its land for fear of death by the hands of their enemies, although their number was in the thousands. Allah made death seize them and then raised them back to life, <b>“Did you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them: “Die.” And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.” </b> [2:243].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> The story of the person who passed by a village that all its inhabitants had died. He could not imagine that Allah can resurrect them. Allah made death seize him for a hundred years and then raised him from the dead, Or (think you of) such as he who passed by a town all in utter ruins. He said:<b> “Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after it’s death?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: “How long did you remain (dead)?” He (the man) said: “(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or a part of a day.” He said: “Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and at your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a Sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.” When this was clearly shown to him, he said: “I Know (now) that Allah is Able to do all things.”</b> [2:259].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5.</b> The story of Abraham who asked Allah to show him how He raises the dead. Allah ordered him to kill four birds, cut them in parts and spread the parts over the surrounding mountains. He told him to call the dead birds, and that he did. These parts were collected (by Allah’s Power) and the birds came back to life and they came to Abraham. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) when Abraham said: “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead. “ He (Allah) said: “Do you not believe?” He (Abraham) said: “Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.” He said: “Take four bird, then cause them to incline towards you (slaughter them, Cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</b> [2:260].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are five examples of incidents that happened. They prove that raising the dead can happen by the will of Allah. We mentioned before that Jesus raised the dead from their graves, by the will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> As for the Mind, there are two ways to correctly use it to confirm raising the dead:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah is the One who started the creation of heavens and earth. The One who is Capable of starting the creation is also Capable of restarting it. Allah said, what translated means, “And He is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has been perished), and this is easier for Him.” [30:27] and, “As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.” [21:104] and to the one who denied that Allah will give life to the bones when they have rotted away, “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)): “‘He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation.” [36:79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> It is noticed that the soil can become dry and that trees and plants die. When Allah sends the rain, the soil comes back to life and plants of all kinds grow and become green. The One who brings life back to the dead soil is Capable of raising the dead. Allah said, what translated means, “And among His Signs (in this), that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth (of vegetation). Verily, He Who gives it life, surely. (He) is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed! He is Able to do all things.” [41: 39] “And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky then We produce therewith gardens and grain (all harvests that are reaped). And tall date-palms, with ranged clusters; A provisions for (Allah’s) slaves. And We give life therewith to dead land. Thus will be the Resurrection (of the dead).” (50:9-11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject punishment or joy in the grave claiming </b> that this cannot happen. They claim that if one exhumes the dead, he will find the grave as it was left and that it did not change in size. This claim is rejected by the Shari’ah, the senses and the mind:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, we mentioned some texts before. These texts confirm the punishment or joy in the grave. Ibn Abbas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said, “The Prophet passed by some walls in Madinah. He heard the screams of two persons who were being punished in their graves.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) mentioned the reasons behind this punishment, <b>“One of them did not protect himself (his clothes) form urine. The other one was spreading (sawing) differences (between people).”</b> [Saheeh ab-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, we know that, while dreaming, the one who is asleep sees that he is enjoying a huge space or that he is feeling pain because he is squeezed in a small area. Sometimes, one’s sleep is interrupted because of such nightmares, although he is still in his bed. Sleeping is similar to dying. Allah said, what translated means, “<b>It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keep those (souls) for which He had ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply.”</b> [39:42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Mind, sometimes one sees dreams that may later happen in real life. Some Muslims may see the Prophet in their dreams. Whoever sees the Prophet, on the shape that he was described in books of Hadith, is saying the truth in that he saw him. This happens while one is still in his bed. If this is the case in this material life, what about matters of the other life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their claim that when one exhumes a dead body, that no signs of abnormal change, either in the body or the grave itself, are detected, we say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The Shari’ah cannot be rejected by depending on these doubts. These doubts can easily be refuted, providing one uses his mind. There is a popular saying: “There are many who refute a truth, while the problem lies with their limited comprehension.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Life in the grave is a matter of the unseen. The senses cannot unveil the unseen. If matters of the unseen are unveiled by the senses, then belief in the unseen will not have any useful meaning, in which case believing or disbelieving is irrelevant, since there would be no matters of the unseen to believe in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> Only the dead feel the punishment or joy in the grave. Also, the one who is dreaming is the only one who is experiencing the pain of being squeezed in a small space or the joy of being in an open area. Others do not feel the same as the one who is experiencing these dreams, although he is still in his bed. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) used to receive revelation while he was among his companions and the companions did not hear the revelation. Sometimes, the angel came in the shape of an invisible man. The companions did not see the angel while he was delivering revelation to the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Humans have limited comprehension and understanding of the universe. They only understand what Allah gave them the capability to understand. They do not understand all of the existence. The seven heavens, the earth and all that which is therein praise Allah. Allah, sometimes, gives the power to some of His creation to hear such praise. Humans cannot hear such praise. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.” </b>[17:44]. Also, devils and the Jinn go about in the earth. The Jinn came to the Messenger and listened to his recitation of the Qur’aan. When he finished, they went back to their nation to convey the Message to them. However, this creation is out of the reach of human’s Comprehension, <b>“O Children of Adam! Let not Satan deceive you, as he got your parents (Adam and Eve) out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiment, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and his soldiers see you from where you will not see them. Verily, We made the devils protectors (and helpers) for those who believe not.”</b> [7:27]. Creation can neither reach what is beyond their comprehension nor understand all the existence. Therefore, one cannot dispute ‘flatters of the unseen that he cannot comprehend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="8"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 8: Belief In Al-Qadar</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadar is Allah’s predestination of measurements and sustenance of everything and everyone, according to His Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Aspects Of Belief In Al-Qadar</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. Knowledge</b> &#8211; The belief that Allah’s Knowledge encompasses everything, every matter, major or minor, and time frames of everything that happens in this universe. Allah’s Knowledge encompasses all of His Actions and actions taken by His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Writing &#8211;</b> The belief that Allah recorded everything in a Book that He kept with Him, called “A1-Lawh’ Al-Mah’foodh” (The Preserved Book). He said, what translated means,<b> “Know you not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh). Verily, that is easy for Allah.” </b>[22:70].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah-ibn-Amr-ibn-al-Aas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) say, what translated means, <b>“Allah recorded the measurement of all matters pertaining to Creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. The belief that nothing, whether related to Allah’s Actions or actions taken by His slaves, can happen without His Permission. </b> He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord Creates whatsoever He wills and chooses.” </b>[28: 68], <b>“ And Allah does what He will.” [14: 27] and, “He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases.”</b> [3: 6]. As for actions taken by His creation, Allah said, <b>“Had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you.”</b> [4:90] and, <b>“And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them alone with their fabrications.”</b> [6:137].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. The belief that Allah created all creation, all what they possess of attributes and all their actions</b>, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian over all things.” [39:62] and, “He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.” [25: 2]. Also, Abraham said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, “While Allah has created you and what you make.” [37:96].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Al-Qadar, as described above, does not mean that people have no power over the actions they chose to take. I</b>slamic Shari’ah and Reality confirm that the person has a will of his own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah said about one’s own will, what translated means, <b>“So, whosoever wills, let him take a Return to his Lord (by obeying His Commandments).” [78:39] and, “So go to your tilt (have sexual relations with your wives) when and how you will (not in the anus).” </b>[2:223]. As for one’s own power over his actions, <b>“So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can; listen and obey.”</b> [64:16] and, <b>“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” </b>[2:286].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Reality of things, every human knows that he has a power and a will of his own. He uses his power and will to indulge in or avoid actions of his choice. Mankind distinguish between what they do by their own power and between what they have no power over, like shivering due to illness or extreme cool. However, the power and will of mankind is under the control of Allah’s Will and Power, <b>“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the worlds.” </b>[8 1:28-29]. The universe is Allah’s property and nothing happens in His Kingdom without His Knowledge and Permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Al-Qadar, as explained above, does not provide an excuse for mankind to sin or abandon what they are obligated to do.</b> This excuse can be rejected using the following arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> Allah said, what translated means, “Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: <b>“If Allah had Willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).</b> <b>“Likewise bellied those who were before them, till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: “Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie” </b>[6:148]. The disbelievers did not have a valid excuse when they said that what they did was according to A1-Qadar. If this excuse was valid, then why will Allah punish them for their sins?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”</b> [4:165]. Sending down the Messengers took place according to A1-Qadar, also. This is why the disbelievers cannot use Al-­Qadar as an excuse for not believing, because Al-Qadar provided them with the means to escape Allah’s punishment by following His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. </b> Ali-ibn-Abi Talib (radiyallaahu anhu) said that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“One’s final destination, in Hell or Paradise, is already determined for each one of you.” A man said, “Should we depend (on this fact), O Messenger of Allah (meaning to abandon working deeds)?” He said, “No. Perform deeds, because everyone will be helped (to go on the path that he chooses and reach his destiny).” Then he read the Ayah. “As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him&#8230;”</b> [92:5].” <b> [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Allah conveyed His Commandments to His slaves and did not require them to do what is beyond their capacity. “So keep your duty to Allah (and fear Him) as much as you can.” [64:16], and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [2:286]. If the slave is forced to do whatever deeds he performs, then Allah would have required from him what is beyond his capacity, and this is a false belief. For this reason, Allah forgives sins that take place because of ignorance or forgetfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. </b> Al-Qadar is a matter of Allah’s Knowledge. No one can uncover his own Qadar but after it happens. One’s intention to perform a deed precedes the action itself. He does not know what Al-Qadar holds for him. Therefore, Al-Qadar is not a valid excuse for sinning and abandoning the Commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6.</b> One always seeks what is convenient for him. No one of sane mind would abandon what brings material benefit to him, saying that Al-Qadar forced him to take this course of action. Therefore, why would one use Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning what brings benefit to him in matters of religion and not do the same for matters of life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man has to choose between two countries to move to, one of them is chaotic, full of incidents of murder, looting, rape, insecurity and hunger. Would he choose to go to this country or would he go to another country, which is safe for him and secure, with abundance in material joys, where one’s honor, possessions and human rights are preserved? There is no doubt that this man would choose the second country, where he will be safe and secure. No one of sane mind would choose to go to the first country, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one choose what ends him up in Hell, rather than Paradise, in the Last Life, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one is sick and is given a medicine to take, he will take the medicine even though he does not like its taste. When one is told to go on a diet, he would not eat the food that he likes, in order to satisfy this diet and to stay fit. No one of sane mind would refuse to take medicines or go on medical diets, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one abandon implementing Allah’s and His Messenger’s Commandments, thus bringing Allah’s Wrath on him, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7. </b>If one of those, who abandon the Commandments and indulge in sinning, comes under attack on his honor or possessions, would he accept the excuse of the attacker, if he says that he attacked him because it was his Qadar to attack him, and therefore he is not to be blamed? Indeed No! Therefore, why does this person refuse Al-Qadar as an excuse for whoever attacked him, while he depends on Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning Allah’s rights on him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported that Omar ibn Al-Khattab (radiyallaahu anhu) was brought a man who was caught stealing. Omar ordered that this man’s hand be cut off. The man said, “Wait, O leader of the believers. I only stole because this was in the Qadar of Allah.” Omar said, “And we are cutting your hand because it is in the Qadar of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Belief In Al-Qadar<br>
1.</b> Depending on Allah alone when one indulges in any action. Taking the necessary precautions is not the cause of one’s success in the intended actions. All matters are under the full control of the Qadar of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> When one succeeds in performing an action, he must not be proud of himself. All good deeds are successfully performed because of Allah’s bounty, because He ordained that this matter to be successful. To be proud will make one forget to thank Allah for permitting him to successfully perform this deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> Believing in Al-Qadar leads one to feel satisfied, safe and secure. All incidents that happen to a person are a result of Allah’s Qadar. One should not feel miserable for losing or not gaining what he likes. All this happens according to the Qadar of Allah. Allah is the King and Lord of the heavens and earth and His Qadar will happen exactly as He Will, <b>“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah. In order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you. And Allah likes not prideful boasters.”</b> [57:22-23]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Pleasing is the attitude of the believer. All of his matters are righteous. This is only for the believer. If a joy is brought to him, he thanks (Allah for it). This is better for him. If a calamity befalls him, he is patient. This is also good for him.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups fell into misguidance with regard to Al­-Qadar:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Jabriyyah &#8211; This group claimed that the person is forced to do whatever he does and that he has no power or will of his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Al-Qadariyyah</b> &#8211; They claimed that the person has a will and power independent of Allah’s Will and Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and Real Life are used to refute the first group, Al-Jabriyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah confirmed that humans have a will and power of their own,<b> ‘Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter.</b> [3:152], “And say: “The Truth is from your Lord.<b>” Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the unjust, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.” </b>[18:29] and. <b>“Whosoever does righteous, good deeds, it is for (the benefit of) his own-self and whosoever does evil, it is against his own-self, and your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</b> [41:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Real Life, everyone knows the difference between his actions, like eating, drinking, selling and buying, and between what is beyond his power, like shivering and accidentally falling off a roof, for example. The first type of actions are his. He chooses them on his own will using his own power. The second type of actions are beyond his control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and The Mind are also used to refute the second group, Al-Qadariyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah created everything and nothing happens without His permission. He said that all actions taken by His slave happen by His Will, <b>“Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed, some of them believed and others disbelieved, If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He likes.”</b> [2:253] and, <b>“And if We had willed, surely! We would have given every person his guidance, but the Word from Me took effect (about evil­doers), that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together.”</b> [32:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for The Mind, the universe is Allah’s Kingdom and mankind are a part of this Kingdom. Therefore, all mankind are owned by Allah. The slave cannot do anything in this Kingdom unless its Lord, Allah, gives him permission.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Saheeh aL-Bukhari &amp; Saheeh Muslim (the wordings are by Al-Bukhari)]. Muslim’s narration of this Hadith reads, “All will be helped to satisfy what they were created for.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ordered the companions to perform righteous, good deeds and not to depend on Al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="9"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 9 : The Goals Of Islamic Belief –(Aqeedah)</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s goals are the destination that he wishes to reach by taking certain actions. The Islamic ‘Aqeedah (belief) has goals and values that are the destination of whoever preserves it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Seeking the Pleasure of Allah and worshipping Him alone. </b> Allah is the Creator who has no partners. Therefore, He alone must be worshipped and His Pleasure must be intended by every action one takes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Freeing the mind from the confusion caused by not following this ‘Aqeedah.</b> Whoever does not believe in this ‘Aqeedah is either an atheist who is worshipping material means or is a follower of misguidance and darkness caused by false beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; Gaining psychological and intellectual satisfaction.</b> The ones who believe in this ‘Aqeedah do not fall victim to psychological complexes or confusion. This ‘Aqeedah builds a direct and strong relationship between the Lord and His salve. The believer accepts Allah as the Lord, the Legislator and The King. He is satisfied with this belief. His heart is pleased with the following of Islam and he would not exchange this pleasure for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; Purifying one’s intentions and deeds. </b> This ‘Aqeedah protects one from falling into misguidance in acts of Worship or in dealings with others. It requires its followers to follow the path set by the Messengers. This path leads to Safety and Purity in the hearts and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5 &#8211; Being serious with regards to all matters.</b> One does not pass the chance to do righteous, good deeds, but he takes any chance to gain Allah’s rewards. One is always on his guard against any path that leads to sin, fearing Allah’s punishment. This ‘Aqeedah requires its followers to believe in the Resurrection and the Day of Reckoning,<b> “(For all there will be degrees (or ranks) according to what they did. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do &#8221; </b>[6:132].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet also encouraged this attitude, <b>“The strong believer is better and more liked by Allah than the weak believer. However, each one of them has (a certain degree of ) goodness. Seek what brings benefit to you and depend on Allah. Do not be weak if any calamity befalls you, do not say: ‘Had I done that, then this would not have happened.’ Only say: ‘Allah has ordained (this matter) and whatever He will He does.’ “Had I,” opens the door wide for the Devil to do his work” </b>[Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6 &#8211; Establishing a strong nation</b> that strives to preserve its religion and solidify its gains. This nation disregards the losses it concurs while striving to preserve the religion. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterwards doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful”</b> [49:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7 &#8211; Reaching happiness in this life and in the Last Life, </b> by leading individuals and groups to guidance and gaining their Lord’s bounties and good rewards, <b>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in Allah) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221;</b> [16:97].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the goals that Islam seeks for its followers to reach. We pray that Allah helps us and the rest of Muslims to reach them.</p>

Explanation of the Three Fundamental Principles of Islaam<br>
© 1997 al-Hidaayah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ihsaan is the opposite of behaving badly, and it means that a person strives to do what is good and to repel harmful things. So he strives to benefit the servants of Allaah through his wealth, position, knowledge and his person. So as for the case of doing good with ones wealth, then he spends and gives in charity, and pays the zakaat, and the best of the types of doing good through wealth is the zakaat since it is one of the pillars of Islaam, and one of its great foundations. A person&#8217;s Islaam will not be complete without it. It is the charity most loved by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that is followed by that which it is obligatory upon a person to spend upon his wife, mother, father, children, brothers, children of his brothers, sisters, paternal uncles, paternal aunts, maternal aunts, and so on. Then by charity given to the poor and to the rest of those deserving of charity &#8211; such as students of knowledge for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the case of doing good by means of ones position, then it is that people are found in different levels. Some of them have status with someone in authority and so strive to benefit the people by means of his position. So if a man comes to him and requests that he should intercede for him with the one in authority then he does so, either to repel some harm from him or to attain some good for him, As for doing good by means of his knowledge, then it is that he strives to pass on his knowledge to Allaah&#8217;s servants, in open and private gatherings and assemblies. Even if people sit socially, to drink coffee, then it pertains to good and fine behaviour that he should teach the people. Even if you are in a public gathering it is from what is good that you teach the people. However wisdom is to be used in this matter. So you should not weary the people making it a habit that every single time you sit in a gathering you admonish and address the people, since the Prophet used to give them admonition now and then, and not too frequently. This is because the souls become weary and bored. When they become bored they become languid and weak and may even come to dislike what is good merely because of the frequency with which the per son stands and addresses them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for seeking to benefit the people with ones person, then the Prophet sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;&#8230; that you help a man to mount and ride his riding beast, or you lift up his luggage on to it for him, is a charity&#8221; [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. Transl. 4/90-94/no. 161) and Muslim (Eng. transl. 2/483-484/ no. 2204)]. So you help this man to carry his luggage, or you guide him to the correct road to take and so on, all of this pertains to ihsaan. So this is with regard to striving to do good to the servants of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for ihsaan in the worship of Allaah, then it is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, as the Prophet ( said. So worship done in this way, that a person worships his Lord as if he were actually seeing Him is worship that is accompanied by yearning and seeking. So a person will find that his soul encourages him upon worship done in this way, since he is yearning for the one he loves. Therefore he worships Him as if he were seeing Him, and he directs his heart to Him and turns to Him and seeks to draw near to Him, He the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then even though you do not see Him, then He certainly sees you.&#8221; This part shows worship done whilst fleeing and fearing, and is therefore the second level of ihsaan. So if you do not worship Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, as if you are seeing Him and seeking Him and your soul is encouraging you towards Him, then worship Him keeping in mind that He sees you. So you will then worship Him as one who fears Him and seeks to flee from His retribution and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This level is held by those having knowledge of these affairs to be lower than the first level. Worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, is, as Ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, said: &#8216;Worship of the Most Merciful is utmost love of Him, along with the worshippers submission and humility, they are its two pillars.&#8217; So worship is built upon these two matters: utmost love, and utmost humility and submission. Love causes one to desire and seek, and humility causes one to fear and flee. This is ihsaan in the worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If a person worships Allaah in this manner, then he will become one who is pure and sincere in his worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He will not desire with his worship that he is seen by the people, or heard of, nor will he desire their praise. It will be the same to him whether the people notice him or do not notice him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will worship with ihsaan in every condition. Indeed part of the completion of purity and sincerity of worship (al-ikhlaas) is that a person should seek not to be seen by the people when he worships, and that his worship should be a secret between him and his Lord. That is unless there is some benefit for the Muslims or for Islaam in his performing it openly, for example if he is a person who is followed and taken as an example and he wishes to manifest his worship to the people so that they should take it as an example to follow; or that he manifests his worship so that his companions, friends and associates should follow his example, then this is good. This benefit which he takes account of may be more excellent and greater than the benefit of keeping it hidden. Therefore, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has praised those who spend of their wealth in charity secretly and openly. So whenever performing it secretly is better and more beneficial for the heart, and causes one to be more humble and submissive, and to turn to Allaah more attentively, then they give in secret. But when performing it openly produces benefit for Islaam, due to manifestation of its prescribed practices, and will mean that the people follow this persons example, then they do this openly. The Believer looks to what is most appropriate. So whatever is most appropriate and most beneficial in worship, then it will be what is most complete and most excellent.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam = May the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have noticed that most of the Europeans and others, who embrace Islam, do not understand the reality of the meaning of the first fundamental principle of Islam, i.e. &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8211; and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So I consider it essential to explain something of the meanings of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) in some detail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-: Rasulullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8230;.. and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221; It has <strong>three aspects</strong> : A, B and C.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect A: It is that, you have. to pledge a covenant with (Allaah), the Creator of the Heavens and Earth, the Ruler of all that exists, the Lord of Majesty and Highness, on four points (or conditions):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 1</strong>: A confession with your heart that the-Creator (of everything) is Allaah, it is that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that the Creator of all the universe including the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, the heavens, the earth with all its known and unknown forms of life, is Allaah.. He is the Organizer and Planner of all its affairs. It is He Who gives life and death, and He (i.e. .Allaah -Alone) is the Sustainer, and the Giver of Security, etc. &#8220;And this is called your confession for the Oneness of the Lordship of Allaah,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;TAUHID Ar-Rububiyya&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 2</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that: None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah Alone. The word &#8220;Worship&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Ibadah) carries a great number of meanings in the Arabic language: It conveys that all kinds of worship are meant for Allaah (and none .else, whether it be an angel, Messenger, Prophet, Jesus-son of Mary, Ezra, Muhammad, saint, idol, the sun, the moon and all other kinds of false deities). So pray to none but Allaah, invoke none but Allaah, ask for help from none (unseen) but Allaah, swear by none but Allaah, offer an animal as sacrifice to none but Allaah,&#8230;etc., and that means &#8211; all what Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) order you to do, (in His Book. The Qur&#8217;an and in the As-Sunna (Legal ways of Prophet Muhammad , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) you must do, and all that Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) forbid you, you must not do.&#8221; And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Worship of Allaah.&#8221;&#8211; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Uluhiyya&#8221;. And that you (mankind) worship none but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 3</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that all the best of names and the most perfect qualities with which You have named or qualified Yourself in Your Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or as Your Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) has named or qualified You, with his statement,&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; I confirm that all those (names and qualifications) are for You without changing their meanings or neglecting them completely or giving resemblance to others.&#8221; As Allaah said: &#8220;There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 42:11). This Holy Verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for Allaah without resemblance to others (the creation), and likewise. He also said: &#8220;To one whom I have created with Both My Hands,&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 38:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also said: &#8220;The Hand of Allaah is over their hands.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 48: 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms two Hands for Allaah, but there is no similarity (i.e. they are NOT like human hands) for them. Similarly Allaah said: &#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allaah) &#8220;Istawa&#8221; (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 20:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He rose over the Throne really in a manner that suits His Majesty. And Allaah is over His Throne over the seventh Heaven, as the slave-girl pointed towards the Heavens, when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) asked her as to where Allaah is? He only comes down over the first (nearest) Heaven to us on the Day of &#8216;Arafat (Hajj, i.e. the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), and also during the last third part of the night as mentioned by the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), but He is with us by His Knowledge only, not by His Personal-Self (bidhatihi). It is not like that, as some people say that Allaah is present everywhere, here. there, and even inside the breasts of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sees and hears all that we do or utter, etc. And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allaah&#8221; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Asma was-Sifat&#8221; and this is the Right Faith, the faith which was followed by the Messengers of Allaah (from Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus to Muhammad ( peace of Allaah be upon them all) and the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and the righteous followers of these Messengers (peace of Allaah be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point IV</strong>:A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is Your Messenger.&#8221; That means that none has the right to be followed after Allaah. but the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), as he is the Last of His Messengers. As Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is not the father of any man among you but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets and Allaah is Ever All-Aware of everything&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 33:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) gives you, take it and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it,&#8221;(Qur&#8217;an 59:7).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said: &#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 3:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for others than Muhammad ( sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), their statements are to be taken or rejected as to whether these are in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or with the Sunna (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) of the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) or not. As the Divine Inspiration has stopped after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and it will not resume except at the time of the Descent of Jesus, son of Mary and he (i.e. Jesus) will rule with justice according to the Islamic Laws. during the last days of the world as it has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith (i.e. Narration of the Prophet Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) (sahih-Al-Bukhari Vol. 3, Hadith No. 425)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect B:. It is essential to utter, &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul Allaah&#8221; (&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah &#8220;. As it has come in the statement of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) to his uncle Abu Talib at the time of the latter&#8217;s death: &#8220;O uncle, if you utter it (&#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;), then I shall be able to argue on your behalf before Allaah, on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Similarly, when Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari embraced Islam, he went to Al-Masjid-al-Haram and he proclaimed it loudly in front of the Quraish infidels Until he was beaten severely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect C: . It is essential that the limbs and all other parts and organs of one&#8217;s body testify to it, and this is very important as regards its meaning (i.e., the meaning of &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah. and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221;). So whoever has confessed this (with his Lord), he shall not Commit sins like robbing. killing, stealing, illegal sexual intercourse, eating pig meat. drinking alcoholic beverages, taking undue advantage of orphan&#8217;s property. cheating in trade. bribery and earning money through illegal means. etc&#8230; or otherwise the limbs, all other parts and organs of his body will testify against him that he was a liar in his words which he pledged to Allaah. In case he commits the above sins, he should know that it is a sin that obliges him to repent to Allaah, and ask His Forgiveness, as (his) body parts (i.e. skin, private parts, hands, tongue ears. etc.) will testify to the above mentioned crimes (i.e. actions) against his self on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with the confession of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) a person enters in the fold of (i.e. embraces) the Islamic Religion accordingly, it is essential for him to believe in all the Messengers of Allaah and not to differentiate between them. As it is mentioned in His Book, Allaah said: &#8220;Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My Slaves (i.e. the angels; Allaah&#8217;s Messengers; Jesus, son of Mary, etc.) as Auliya&#8221; (Lords, Gods, Protectors etc.) besides Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allaah&#8211;Islamic Monotheism). Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam): Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?&#8221; Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Those are they who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and in the meeting with Him (in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall not give them any weight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That shall be their recompense, Hell, because they disbelieved and took My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic&#8211;Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, they shall have the gardens of Al-Firdaus (Paradise) for their entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wherein they shall dwell (for ever). No desire will they have to be removed there from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say ( O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ! to Mankind): If the sea were ink ( with which to write) the Words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted, before the Words of my Lord would be finished even if We brought (another sea) like it for its aid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), I am only a man like you, it has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God &#8212; i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&#8221; (The Qur&#8217;an 18: 102-1 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This introduction is necessary for anyone who wishes to embrace Islam. After this confession he (or she ) should take a bath (i.e. Ghusl) and then offer a two Rak&#8217;at prayer, and act upon the five Principles of Islam, as narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) in the Book, Sahih Al-Bukhari. Vol. I Hadith No.7 : Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), Allaah&#8217;s Messenger , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, said: Islam is based on (the following five (principles):</p>
<p>1. To testify La ilaha ill Allaah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah and that Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger).</p>
<p>2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly (Iqamat-as -Salat).</p>
<p>3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity).</p>
<p>4. To perform Hajj (i.e. Pilgrimage to Makka).</p>
<p>5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and must believe in the six Articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in:</p>
<p>(I) Allaah,<br>
(2) His Angels,<br>
(3) His Messengers,<br>
(4) His Revealed Books,<br>
(5) the Day of Resurrection, and<br>
(6) Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments i.e. whatever Allaah has ordained must come to pass).]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">His booklet: &#8220;<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa&#8217;ikah</i>&#8221;<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels have duties. Each of them has a duty that he is entrusted with, and he does not delay in carrying it out. Rather, he executes it acting on Allaah’s order and He doesn’t disobey Him. Allaah says: <b>“(Hell) Over which are angels stern and severe who do not disobey the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded.” </b>[Surah At-Tahreem: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Some of their Duties: </b><br>
<b>First: </b>Those who take charge of the Hellfire. They are known as the Guardians of Hell, meaning, those entrusted with the Hellfire and with tormenting its inhabitants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>Among them are angels that are entrusted with carrying the Throne of Allaah, as He says: <b>“Those who carry the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord and believe in Him. And they ask forgiveness for those who believe, (saying): ‘Our Lord! You encompass all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent.’” </b>[Surah Ghaafir: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“And bearing the Throne of your Lord on that Day will be eight (angels).” </b>[Surah Al-Haaqah: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Number of Angels who will Bear the Throne: </b><br>
The angels that will carry the Throne are four. Then on the Day of Judgement their number will increase to eight. The Throne of Allaah is the greatest of His creations, which will be carried on the Day of Judgement by eight angels. This shows that they are indeed mighty, since they will carry this magnificent Throne, which is the greatest and mightiest of Allaah’s creations. This indicates their power and their tremendous composures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third:</b> Among them are those angels entrusted with revelation. Allaah says: <b>“He sends down the angels with the <i>Rooh</i> (spirit/revelation) from His Command to whomever He wills from His servants, (saying): ‘Warn mankind that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Me, so be dutiful to Me.’” </b>[Surah An-Nahl: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <i>Rooh</i> (spirit) here means revelation. It is called <i>Rooh</i> because it is the revelation that brings life to the hearts, just as the rain brings life to the earth. In the same sense, it is the created Rooh (spirit) that brings life to the bodies of animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Rooh</i> can also stand for the Qur’aan, as Allaah says: <b>“And thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a <i>Rooh</i> (i.e. Qur’aan) from Our Command.”</b> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Rooh</i> here stands for the Qur’aan, since it is that which brings life to the hearts of the believers, just as the earth is brought to life by rain. Such is the case with the hearts of the believers – they are brought to life by way of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <i>Rooh</i> is also used to refer to Jibreel, who is the greatest, most honorable and virtuous of all the angels. He is the one who brought the Qur’aan down from Allaah to Muhammad, as Allaah says: <b>“The trustworthy spirit (Jibreel) brought it (i.e. the Qur’aan) down – to your heart (O Muhammad) in order that you may be from the warners – in a plain Arabic language.”</b> [Surah Ash-Shu’araa: 193-195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jibreel brought the Qur’aan down to the heart of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), and he in turn conveyed it to his ummah. In another ayah, Allaah says: “Say: The holy spirit (Jibreel) brought it down from your Lord.” [Surah An-Nahl: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is referring to the angel Jibreel – he is the holy spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Attributes of Jibreel: </b><br>
Allaah has described Jibreel with great characteristics, as He says: <b>“So verily, I swear by the planets that recede (disappear during the day and appear at night). And by the planets that move swiftly and hide themselves. And by the night as it departs. And by the dawn as it brightens. Verily, this is the Word (brought by) an honorable messenger (i.e. angel) – Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne. Obeyed (by the angels), trustworthy there (in the heavens).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 15-21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Attribute:</b> Power: Allaah says: <b>“Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 20] The <b>“Lord of the Throne”</b> here refers to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Attribute:</b> Position: Allaah says: <b>“Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 20] This means that he possesses a high position in the sight of Allaah, which no one else has reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Attribute:</b> Obedience: All of the angels obey Jibreel by the Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Attribute:</b> Trustworthiness: This refers to the revelation, such that he doesn’t make additions or subtractions to it, but rather, He conveys it just the way that Allaah has revealed it to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prophet Muhammad’s Seeing Jibreel: </b><br>
Allaah says: <b>“And your companion is not insane.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 22] This is what the disbelievers claimed about him (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). <b>“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Jibreel) in the clear horizon).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 23] Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw Jibreel on the horizon twice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Time: </b>This was in the valley of Makkah. The Prophet Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) lifted his head and saw him in the sky and he had 600 wings. Each one of his wings blocked the horizon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Time: </b>Allaah says: <b>“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent – near the lote-tree of the utmost boundary.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 13-14] This occurred during the night in which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) ascended to the heaven and saw him in his natural state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the attributes of Jibreel. Allaah says: <b>“Verily, this is the Word (brought by) an honorable messenger (i.e. angel).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: Even though the Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah, it is ascribed to Jibreel here, since he is the one who conveyed it to Muhammad. So he is conveying from Allaah, for he dictated it to our messenger, Muhammad, conveying it from Allaah. However, it is the Speech of Allaah. Speech is only attributed to the one who states it originally, not to the one who says it conveying it from someone else. However, the Speech of Allaah has been attributed to Jibreel here from the perspective of his conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourth: There are angels entrusted with other duties: </b> 1. Mikaa’eel: He is responsible for the raindrops that fall down from the sky. He moves them around and causes the rain to descend wherever Allaah commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the Trumpet. This will be at the time when Allaah wants to resurrect the creatures from their graves. The bodies will be brought forth from the graves and reassembled. Then the only thing remaining (to be integrated) will be the soul. It is at this point that Israafeel will blow on this horn, due to Allaah’s Command, and the souls will float to their respective bodies, which had come out and risen from their graves. Then they will walk to where Allaah orders them to go. Allaah says: “The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as if they were racing to a goal.” [Surah Al-Ma’aarij: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“They will come forth with humbled eyes from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread about. Hastening towards the caller, the disbelievers will say: ‘This is a hard day.’”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the three angles that are responsible for life. Jibreel is responsible for bringing the revelation, which brings life into the hearts. And Mikaa’eel is responsible for the raindrops, which bring life to the earth after its death. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the trumpet, which will bring life to the bodies (on the Day of Resurrection). This is why when the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would get up for prayer at night, after saying the opening Takbeer, he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would say in his opening supplication: <b>“O Allaah! Lord of Jibreel, Mikaa’eel and Israafeel, Originator of the heavens and the earth…”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the greatest angels due to the magnitude of their duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fifth: </b>There are also angels that are put in charge of the fetuses in the mothers’ wombs. This has been reported in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>), in which he said: “The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) narrated to us – and he is the truthful one who is believed – saying: ‘Verily the creation of each of one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed, then he is a clot of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period. Then the angel is sent to him and commanded with four matters – to write down his means of livelihood, his life span, his actions, and whether he will be happy or unhappy.’” Allaah sends this angel to him to carry out this great important task.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sixth: </b>There are angels that are in charge of taking the souls when their prescribed time is over. There is the Angel of Death (Malak-ul-Mawt) about whom Allaah says: <b>“Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls.’”</b> [Surah As-Sajdah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Angel of Death has assistants that will aid him, as Allaah says: <b>“Until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (i.e. the Angel of Death and his assistants) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allaah, their Master, the Just Lord.”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 61-62] So taking the soul at the time of death is ascribed to the angels, to the Angel of Death and also to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “It is Allaah who takes away the souls at the time of their death.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 42] Death is ascribed to Allaah here because He is the One who orders it to occur. It is ascribed to the angels because they are the ones who physically carry that out by gathering the soul and leading it out of the human’s body until it reaches his throat. And it is also ascribed to the Angel of Death &#8211; <b>“Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls’”</b> – because he is the one in charge of seizing the souls after they have been rounded up in the last stage (of death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seventh:</b> There are also angels in charge of recording the deeds of the son of Aadam (i.e. humans), as occurs in the hadeeth: <b>“You are constantly being frequented (in successive shifts) by angels at night and angels during the day.” Allaah says: “And verily, there are guardians (i.e. angels recording your deeds) over you – Honorable, recording (your deeds). They know all that you do.”</b> [Surah Al-Infitaar: 10-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Every human being has two angels with him: </b><br>
Every human amongst us has two angels that are responsible over him – an angel on his right side recording his good deeds and another on his left side recording his bad deeds. Allaah says: <b>“When the two receivers receive (i.e. record his deeds) from his right side and his left side, sitting. Not a word does he utter, except that there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).”</b> [Surah Qaaf: 17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These guardian angels accompany a human being whether he is on a journey or sitting at home – they are next to him at all times under all conditions – during his prayer, while he is prostrating, etc. – they accompany him and do not leave him alone except under specific circumstances, such as when the person is relieving himself (in the bathroom). So these angels record his statements and his actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The angels record People’s Intentions and Objectives: </b><br>
It has been related that the angels also record a person’s intentions and inner objectives, which are located in the heart. Whatever he intends to do, they record it. This is why a person is rewarded for having good intention, since it is an action of the heart, while he is punished for evil intentions, since the intention is an action of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels are put in charge of recording a person’s deeds from the time that he reaches the age of puberty – the age of discernment – to the time when Allaah takes his soul in death. And they record against him everything that he does in his life – whether that is in the form of intentions, actions, statements, or other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Status of the Fajr and ‘Asr Prayers amidst the Other Prayers:</b><br>
The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“You are constantly being frequented (in successive shifts) by angels at night and angels during the day. And they gather together during the ‘Asr Prayer and during the Fajr Prayer.” This is why these two prayers are the greatest of all prayers. Allaah says: “Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. Fajr Prayer) is witnessed (by the angels).”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 78] He is referring here to the Fajr Prayer, which the angels of the night and the angels of the day attend. They gather together to witness the Fajr prayer along with the Muslims and listen to the Qur’aan that is recited in prayer. They also gather together during the ‘Asr Prayer, where Allaah asks them, even though He is most knowledgeable of the answer: <b>“In what state did you leave My servants?”</b> The angels reply, saying: <b>“We came to them while they were praying and we left them while they were praying.”</b> This means that they descended while we were praying ‘Asr and they attended the prayer along with us. And then they rose back up (to the heavens) while we were praying Fajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it has been determined that the ‘Asr Prayer is the <b>“Middle Prayer”</b> that Allaah has encouraged us about, where He says: <b>“Guard strictly the (five daily) prayers, especially the middle prayer (i.e. ‘Asr).”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 238] He means by this the ‘Asr prayer since that is the prayer that the (guardian) angels of the night and the angels of the day attend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Call to those who fall short: </b><br>
So where are those who hold back from attending the Fajr Prayer, sleeping (instead) in their beds and not witnessing this great event every night with the angels of the Most Merciful? This is such that these angels inform about these attendees (of the Fajr Prayer) while in the most highest of gatherings, saying: <b>“We came to them while they were praying and we left them while they were praying.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefit has this person who refrains from going to the Fajr Prayer and instead prefers sleep gained from his actions? And what benefit has this person who misses out on attending the ‘Asr Prayer, due to laziness, preferring sleep or some other deed, gained from his actions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in the hadeeth that: <b>“Whoever misses the ‘Asr Prayer, it is as if he lost his family and wealth.”</b> And in another hadeeth it states: <b>“…then he has nullified his actions.”</b> This means that he has taken the prayer out of its proper time. So if he takes it out of its proper time, he has missed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Eight:</b> There are also angels that are responsible for protecting humans from perils. A human being is prone to walk into dangers everyday. However, Allaah entrusts angels that guard and protect him from these dangers during his lifetime, which Allaah has ordained for him. This earth, which a human being walks upon everyday, contains many dangers. There are wild beasts, snakes, scorpions, not to mention transgressors from among humans – enemies and oppressors. However, Allaah has placed these angels around the human being. Allaah says: <b>“He has those (angels) who constantly surround him – from before him and behind him, protecting him by the Command of Allaah.”</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, so long as Allaah has decreed that this individual will be safe from harms, these angels will protect and guard him, and no human will be able to harm him. But if Allaah desires to bring an end to his appointed time, He removes them from him – one from before him and one from behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Verily, Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they (first) change the condition of themselves. And when Allaah desires a bad end for a people, there is no turning it back.”</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11] So if Allaah’s Divine Pre-Decree comes to pass and He desires to put an end to this person, the angels that constantly surround him withdraw themselves from him because they do not refrain from carrying out Allaah’s Command. These are the angels that constantly surround a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ninth:</b> There are also angels that have responsibilities in this universe that only Allaah has knowledge of. There are angels that are put in charge of the seas and angels put in charge of the days. There are angels responsible for the winds and angels put in charge of carrying out many other duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the events that occur in the universe and which constantly transpire within it on a daily basis are only by Allaah’s decreeing that. As for the angels, they carry out whatever tasks Allaah orders them to execute.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Khutubul-Haajah …..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, <em>bi iznillaahi ta&#8217;ala</em> and to describing the cure or the remedy for the illness which is &#8220;decrease after increase&#8221;, the changing of  the condition of a person from <em>eemaan</em> to <em>Kufr</em> or from <em>taqwa</em> and righteousness to evil-doing and misbehaving regarding the orders of Allaah; or from guidance to going astray. This is upon levels. So if an individual was upon <em>Istiqaama</em> and was upon righteousness and then they go back upon their heels, then one fears for that individual &#8216;<em>soo al khaatimah</em>&#8216; (evil or bad ending). This was from the characteristics of the <em>salaf </em> that they would fear a bad ending so therefore they would watch their actions and their behavior. What are some of the reasons behind this matter of backing up after having been steadfast? Or getting misguidance after having guidance? or going astray after one was upon the straight way? or becoming someone who is easy for the individual to commit sins when prior to this it was a hard and  very rare or at least a difficult issue for that individual to fall into sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the reasons we will mention <em>inshaa&#8217; Allaah ta&#8217;ala</em> are:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first reason</span></strong> – &#8220;<strong>The weakness of an individual&#8217;s eemaan</strong>&#8220;. And this weakness of eemaan carries with it all types of diseases and all types of other illnesses from the hardness of the heart, and the easiness of falling into sin and laziness when it comes to doing or establishing obediences and worships directed towards Allaah. All obedience and worship is for the purpose of Allaah, done for the pleasure of Allaah. But here laziness regarding those matters and the absence of being affected by the Qur&#8217;aan or by <em>Salah</em> (Prayer) and the small amount of fear from Allaah. These are some of the signs of what? Weakness of eemaan. Which is one of the causes for &#8220;the decrease after the increase&#8221;. And a lot of arguing and debate and dissension, this is another reason and another illness. And the absence of feeling that one is responsible in front of Allaah for what one does and that one would be asked, questioned in front of Allaah for everything that one does and and other forms of this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many other reasons that this take place is &#8211;  staying away or being faraway from the righteous companions and from the sittings of knowledge;  and being busy with the <em>dunya</em> (the material world), a long or wide and expensive hope; falling into that and embarking upon that which is <em>haraam</em>. So if eemaan because of that becomes weak, you find that the condition of that individual who has that weak eemaan would change &#8211; from being someone upright, from being someone righteous to being someone astray, and being someone corrupt, and being someone who is going in the incorrect way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So first and foremost, there must be a treatment for this weakness of eemaan. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is by being sincere, having &#8216;a<em>l-Ikhlaas</em>&#8216;- some of the greatest benefits of &#8216;<em>Ikhlaas</em>&#8216;- it is of paramount importance that the individual be sincere &#8211; that the actions be done for Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another remedy for weakness of eemaan is to reflect upon the Qura&#8217;an, reflect upon the meaning of the Qura&#8217;an, contemplate the meaning of the Qura&#8217;an and to fear Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. Fearing Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> which is &#8211; those who know Allaah fear him the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to recall the greatness of Allaah<em> tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em></strong></span>, the power of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>; that Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> if He wanted to destroy the heavens and the earth and all that is between them (its inhabitants or whatever, all creatures), none could stand in His way. When Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> sent destruction to the people of Lut and other  narrations or <em>ayaahs</em> or verses that deal with the punishment of other nations, there it is narrated that it did not take Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala to send an army but rather He sent one of His angels. And knowing the greatness and the majesty of the creation, one can appreciate the greatness of Allaah<em> tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. And the fact that one of these angels, it was narrated that it would take 700 years of flight for the bird to go from the earlobe of this angel to his shoulder. So it did not require when Allaah  <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> wanted to punish those of the past and in particular the people of Lut ,He did not send an army but one angel who it is stated that he lifted the whole valley up on the tip of one of his wings and the inhabitants of the heavens could hear the barking of their dogs, turned it around and smashed them and crushed them. This is the might of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and that to other nations He just sent some angel to shout (<em>Saihah</em> &#8211; a shouting). One shouting left them in their places in a position of prostration from death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one reflects upon the greatness of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, we realize that if He willed and He wanted, He could make the air that we breathe unbreathable, so impossible for us to breathe, or the water that we drink undrinkable so that we cannot benefit from it and so on and so forth. Thinking about the greatness of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and the sheer strength and power of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> brings about <em>al-khawf</em> (fear of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Wat-Tawbah min al-Dunoob&#8221; (Repenting from the Sins)</span></strong> &#8211; another means of getting away from the illness of weakness of eemaan is making <em>tawbah</em> &#8211; returning back to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, repenting to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, asking Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> for forgiveness, asking Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> to forgive, &#8216;<em>tawbah</em>&#8216; from <em>dhunoob</em> <em>wal ma&#8217;aasi</em> &#8211; from sins and ill behaviour and disobedience to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;al</em>a.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And &#8216;<em>wal khawf min sooil khaathima</em>&#8221; (the fearing of an evil end)</span></strong> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and to think about death:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, to think about death and the Hereafter. Reflection of death changes one&#8217;s whole world. Reflection of death takes  something that seems difficult and makes it easy. Reflection of death makes one watch one&#8217;s talk, watch one&#8217;s hands, watch one&#8217;s step and watch one&#8217;s movement and behavior when one reflects upon death. That death would come to each and every one of us, there is no doubt about that &#8212; that one day the soul is going to reach the throat and the blood is going to run cold and the heart is going to stop beating and the light that is in the eyes that gives us the ability to have sight is going to be removed and that there is nothing that we can do and when that time approaches and when it happens there is no delay in it, we can&#8217;t say, <em>&#8216;wait a minute, give me time to say something to my family, give me a moment to straighten up  my affairs</em>.&#8217; Know that once the process starts it ends with us, the soul being removed from our body and the occurrence therefore of that is death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thinking about the <em>aakhira</em> (the Hereafter) is a means of dealing with weakness of faith:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death, thinking about death and thinking about the <em>aakhira</em>, the Last Day and all that will happen in the Last Day &#8212; from the punishment of the grave and before the punishment of the grave, the tightness of the grave and the darkness of the grave and the answer or questioning test of the two angels and coming out of the grave and being barefooted, naked and uncircumcised and being on the Day of Judgment where all the multitudes will be gathered until there is no room to move. You can&#8217;t go forward, you can&#8217;t go backwards, you can&#8217;t go to the left and you can&#8217;t go to the right and some people will be upon their faces and the punishment of Allaah  <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> will be severe. You will see the children&#8217;s hair turning grey and the women who will have their load dropping their load, you will think that people are drunk but it is not drunkenness but rather the punishment of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. Thinking about the Akhira the Hereafter is a means of dealing with weakness of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Being far removed from the atmosphere of eeman &#8211; One of the Reasons for the weakness of Faith:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason why people fall into unrighteousness after they were righteous, weak eemaan after having strong eemaan, misguidance after having being guided is &#8216;al Ittiaad&#8217; &#8211; being far removed from the atmosphere of eeman. One has to make oneself in &#8216;al-ajwa&#8217;ah&#8217; or &#8216;al jawil al eemaani&#8217; &#8211; the atmosphere, the environment of eemaan. One has to make oneself be in an environment of eemaan. Those who are faraway from the environment of eemaan, from &#8216;Majaaris al ilm&#8217; &#8211; sitting to get knowledge, &#8216;wal masjid&#8217;- coming to the Masjid, &#8216;wal Qura&#8217;an&#8217; &#8211; reciting Qura&#8217;an, sitting and reciting Qura&#8217;an and good companionship or righteous companionship, were good example; &#8216;Al-Qudwa&#8217; &#8211; righteous examples for individuals, that one can see who are striving for the Hereafter and striving to be righteous; &#8216;Wa Qiyaamul layl&#8217; &#8211; making Salaah at night, &#8216;Wal Adhkaar&#8217; &#8211; remembrance of Allaah and other than that when people remove themselves from the environment of eemaan it leads to backing up, it leads to going upon one&#8217;s heels, falling back upon one&#8217;s heels, it leads to an individual going in the wrong direction and turning away from what is right. So when a person, Muslim Man, woman or child is removed from righteous brothers or righteous companions or righteous sisters for sisters for a very long period of time for instance traveling or because of their job or something of this nature, they lose the environment of eemaan. And when they lose the environment of eemaan it weakens them. It weakens them and when they are weakened they turn away from that in which they were on or they become weak in their sticking – to what they used to stick to of Deen and if this is not caught by the person it can be a matter or a means of destruction for that individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam of the Sunnah Al-Hasan al Basree (Rahimahullah) used to say &#8216;Ikhwaanina&#8217;- Our Brothers, Aghlaa indanaa min ahlinaa &#8211; are more precious and expensive to us than our families, and the wife and the children. Our brothers are &#8216;aghlaa&#8217; more precious, more expensive, more dear to us than our family because our family remind us of Dunya – &#8216;We want this, we need this, let&#8217;s go here, lets go there, well what about this, well what about that&#8217; reminding us of Dunya. But our brothers remind us of the Akhira. As we find brothers who are upon the Qura&#8217;an &amp; Sunnah, the way of the salafus saalih, who fear Allah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala and the Last Day, hope with the meeting of Allah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala, they remind you of what? Al-Akhira &#8211; the Last Day.  So upon the Muslim is to guard himself and to make sure that he or she strives against the desires of his self, to make sure that they place themselves in atmospheres of eemaan and this is something that we have the opportunity to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, we have to  make the house &#8211; a  house of eemaan. Make the Baith – Baith Muslim, make the house, the house of a Muslim. This is a very important factor that I heard over 50 years ago, (from Sheik Abu Bakr Jaabir al Jazairi hafidahullah), the man who had been teaching tawhid and tafseer in the Masjid of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) for well over 40 years or more in a series of lectures he did upon the corruption of the society, where he dealt with this issue that the house of a Muslim MUST be the house of a Muslim. The house of a Muslim is not a &#8216;mal ab&#8217;- not a playground.  The house of a Muslim is not a disco, the house of a Muslim is not a cinema. The house of a Muslim is where you find Qura&#8217;an and he used to say Haafidhahullah that what is this zero want by others to hear the voices of those who sing and so on so forth, music and all of this when you have some of the greatest reciters of Qura&#8217;an, the likes of, we are talking about their recitation not necessarily their Aqeedah or their Manhaj. When an individual he wants to listen to something, was concerned about the Manhaj he wouldn&#8217;t listen to anything that had any connection with music &#8211; which is the Qura&#8217;an of Shaitan. He said we have the best reciters (the likes of Tablaawi, the likes of Abdul Baasit, the likes of  Husri). We can go further to those whom we know in the present day other than al-Mishaawi, but al-Hudhaifi and the ai&#8217;imma of the various masaajid and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The house of the Muslim should have that playing, listening to the recitation of Qura&#8217;an. In this Qura&#8217;an, the house of the Muslim has in it the Qura&#8217;an, has in it the remembrance of Allaah, has in it Sajdah and Rukou, has in it serenity and peace, has in it talking of good. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said that the one who Allaah wants good for, this is from the families &#8212; the husband, wife and children, whom Allaah wants good for, he places between them Rahma. He places between them Mercy &#8211; that if there is good in them, they have between them Rahma or Mercy, so that the house becomes after the Masjid a refuge from Fitnah, a refuge from confusion, a refuge from the call to desires, a refuge from that. The house of a Muslim becomes the house of a Muslim. So who is it that comes in our house and say: bring in a television so that you can witness the Kuffar and learn how to act from the Kuffar and learn how to dress from the Kuffar and learn the ill, sick diseases of the Kuffar? Who is it that puts a gun to our head and said bring to your houses those magazines that impress you about the Kuffar.? Who is it that brings any of this and forces us to look down upon the Qura&#8217;an and let it collect dust on the shelf, and forces us not to teach our children or take 15 minutes or half an hour of the day to teach them the book of Allaah or the Sunnah of the messenger Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, or some wisdom of the salafus saalih? I don&#8217;t think any one is forced. And if you go further who is it that has us hooked up to our houses with these issues such as Satellite dishes and cable and so on and so forth and to witness things that may be even Shaitan would be ashamed of! Who is it?. No one!! So upon the believer is to make, to build, to construct environments of eemaan. This is a very important matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third cause for those who had righteousness then becoming unrighteous, who had a difficulty falling into sins and sins with the exception and then therefore after that their sins become a rule and becomes a habit. And those who had strong eemaan and now they have weak eemaan what is referred to as &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; another reason is the oppressiveness of the society that we live in. This is not just the societies in the countries of the Kuffar but even in the societies of Muslim countries. Even though the oppression is less, no doubt, but what he refers to here is, he means in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First and Foremost he is referring to the Muslims. When I read these words you will understand that. So, if that is the case with Muslims in Muslim circles, then what about the one who is surrounded by the oppressive society? What is meant by &#8216;oppressive&#8217;, is the push of the society upon an individual who is sticking to his Deen. What about that? The influence of the Kuffar, the influence of those who are evil upon this type of individual. These are the type of societies that we live in; the Muslim who is trying to stick his Deen is that he mixes with individuals who are not concerned whether or not they disobey Allah. In our case, we mix with people who are around people who are not concerned by whether or not they commit Shirk and Kufr, so what about disobedience? In the sense after Kufr and Shirk everything else is light. So you can see that he is referring to the Muslim countries first, but we have to focus also and know that if this is the case there then our condition here is even worse and so we should pay attention to that. So we mix with individuals who are not concerned with the commission of sins :</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Singing the songs;</li>
<li>listening and calling to music;</li>
<li>Smoking cigarettes or whatever;</li>
<li>Reading dirty magazines or magazines that have no benefit;</li>
<li>One whose tongue is not safe from Gheebah &#8211; backbiting, cursing, swearing and making fun and mockery of the believers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Muslim who sticks to Deen when he comes to one of these settings or is invited to a Walimah or Aqeeqah or whatever he finds all types of Munkaraat- all types of evil matters and he finds conversation taking place about matters of Dunya. Either  about trading or &#8216;Thijaarah&#8221;, buying and selling or about a person&#8217;s &#8216;wadiwa&#8217; &#8211; particular business or position that they have in the business world or about wealth or about the acquiring of properties or money or whatever. And the problems of the Dunya and others in that until it is a matter of placing into the heart based upon the conversations, based upon what people are talking about &#8212; a deep love of Dunya in the heart. A deep love of Dunya in the heart !! So therefore the heart becomes hard, and a person backs up on their sticking to the Deen of Allaah. They back up from being righteous. If this person like this has been oppressed by his environment to this degree, mixing, just mere mixing in this way affects him, if you add to that, that he&#8217;s also been tested with some wealth, he has got some money to spend, and if you add to that he may be also tested with a wife, or if it is a sister or a brother who has weak eemaan, or children that are like their father, if his weak in his eemaan, or like their mother if she is weak in eemaan, then he will not be able to be fixed and firm upon his Deen and he will leave those matters and leave being righteous and leave being upright. Then if you find that if he mixes with his kith and kin, (he is referring to the Muslim families) then what about the Kuffar, if his family members are Kuffar? And if he mixes with his kith and kin, his neighbours and his peers, he finds words that are distasteful and mockery, open mockery or hidden mockery. And he finds people who try to advise him to be balanced, that you&#8217;re going to the extreme, your thobe is too far above your ankle, why do u have to let your beard grow that much? See, the type of naseehah  he is given. Yes, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said adDeen anNaseehah &#8211; but not  this type of naseehah. This is the type of naseehah he is given to backup from what he is on. Many of them, or many  individuals are tested like this &#8212; backup, fall short and in the end it is possible for that person to lose the Dunya and the Akhira &#8212; to lose this world and the Hereafter. So this is a cause also. And that is why the first issue of being around people who are &#8216;Saalih&#8217; – who are righteous and environments that are righteous is of utmost importance because we begin to mix with those who don&#8217;t mind smoking cigarettes even though it is Haraam, they like to say Makrouh. It is what you hear all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As one student of knowledge told one of these individuals, who was smoking, he was looking at him and he said &#8220;Don&#8217;t smoke&#8221;.  The smoking individual, then inhaled a big amounts into his mouth and brought it out of his nose and said, &#8220;its makrouh yaani.&#8221; Is it Makhrou?  This is the type of mentality that you are dealing with. It is not makrouh it is Haraam. So when you mix with these type of individuals it can be dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another issue or reason that people go from being correct or upright to corruption, from being righteous to becoming unrighteous or from being strong in their belief to becoming weak in their belief is Daahf al tarbiyyah Azzaatiyyah&#8217; &#8212; their personal tarbiyyah is weak. Their personal education islamically of themselves and cultivation of themselves is weak. Because the Muslims doesn&#8217;t make sure to watch himself and guard himself and make sure that he cultivates himself and strives against himself, he will fall back upon his heels. There must be times throughout the hours of the day where it is just him and Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. There must be times where he takes a &#8220;Time out&#8221; to be by himself focused on Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala, making Dua, making Ibadah, making Tasbih, Tahmeem, wa tahleel, reflecting upon the names and qualities of Allaah and calling upon Allaah. He must have those times throughout the day, where in those times he judges himself, calls himself to account as Umar Ibn Al Khattab (Amirul Mu&#8217;mineen), the Farouq of this ummah used to say &#8220;call yourself to account before you are called  to account&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer takes some time out of the day to look at what he has done of benefit to himself of good deeds and righteousness and whatever and what has he done that is harmful to himself. And therefore make Istighfar &#8211; ask Allaah for forgiveness and make Tawbah – repent to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. He must also have some time throughout the day, and this something that one of the students of knowledge Sheikh Abu Abdurrahman Hisham Arif Hafidahullah who teaches Tawhid, Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih at Masjid Baithul Maqdis &#8211; Masjidul Aqsa  asked the brothers at the last convention of the Qura&#8217;an and Sunnah Society :  &#8220;How many hours do you read a day, some book of knowledge?&#8221; and he said &#8216;you must also in your reading also take notes, you must get into the habit of writing. For this is keeping in accordance with the Sunnah that the Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam established when he said &#8220;Keep knowledge through writing &#8211; Qayyid ul Ilm fil Kitaab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So actually physically writing down, and you find that the scholars of the past had books that they called Fawaid &#8211; benefits, a daftar if you will (a notebook) for benefit. When you hear something that is beneficial, it does not have to be under any specific title or anything else you write down the benefit. Who said this, who did this, what was this statement, what was that Umar Ibn Al Khattab said what? Wa kaza, wa kaza wa kaza &#8212; you write it down. So there must be that type of Shirh saalih al ilm and even if it was for a small period of time (half an hour of the day) what is done continuously you will see benefit. You will see benefit, you will see yourself grow and reach a level that you didn&#8217;t think that you were going to reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because as they say &#8216;a journey of a thousand, million miles begins with a footstep&#8217;. And little tiny footsteps, you look up and you say how did I get way down here or how did I get way up here? And this is the case with knowledge. So there must be times where an individual uses lil tahseelil ilm wash-shar &#8216;ee to achieve Islaamic knowledge and to teach it and to review it and to present before himself issues that he my not have learnt or knew before &#8212;  to learn something new. It is incorrect to be upon the same level of Deen and knowledge that one was 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 years ago. That you find that the brother has not made one move or the sister has not made one move, not learnt one ayah more of Qura&#8217;an, not learnt one more hadith, not learnt one more story of the Sahabah. Still can&#8217;t tell you about the Seerah – the life of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) from his birth to his death, they cant tell you that. They don&#8217;t know the battles that the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) took part in, don&#8217;t know who his wife and children, sons and daughters were, don&#8217;t know who his uncles, aunts and wet-nurses were. What is this? Yet this is Muhammed (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) who is the person we say that we follow and we don&#8217;t know, (these basic things about him). As a matter of fact it gets worse than that since many individuals may know more about an athletic individual who is into athletics, football and basketball, or maybe even worse than that, who is an entertainer, a singer, an actress or an actor. They many know what these guys like from A-Z, know where they were born, where they went to school, what their achievements up on a football field, or a basketball court, but they wouldn&#8217;t know anything about Muhammed ibn Abdullah (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)? And if you asked them about the Prophet&#8217;s Kunya, they wouldn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was surprised, I was amazed and we live in a time of amazement. I was amazed, we went to the Masjid and I gave a Khutbah called &#8220;Be like Mustafa&#8221; (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). Be like Mustafa, walk like Mustafa, talk like Mustafa, dress like Mustafa, act like Mustafa. After the Khutbah, after salah, there were a young group of children saying &#8220;Who is Mustafa&#8221;. Not knowing who is Mustafa? It is one of the names of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and that was about whom I was referring to. But if you ask them about Michael Jordan, or you ask them about Pokemon, or you ask them about any of the filth that has come out of the minds of the Kuffar that they have constructed and placed, they know about them.<br>
Where is the Tarbiyyah? There is no Tarbiyyah at all in the majority of cases. Let&#8217;s not fool ourselves. If your child wants to be more like that Mushrik, like that Kafir, dress like him, talk like him, walk like him, be like him and does not know anything about those that you say are the best generations and you make intisaad or connect yourself to the salaf-us saalih, there is no Tarbiyyah   whatsoever.  You can&#8217;t claim to say Tarbiyyah. He should want to wear his thobe to the calf because Ibn Umar wore it that way, to the shin of the leg, because Abdul Masood was like that; he should want to die on a battlefield and be killed because Sa&#8217;ad Ibn Abi Waqas was like that; Abu Bar Ibn Jarar was like that, because most of the salafs were like that. He should want to leave home and seek knowledge because Imaam Shafi was like that, Imaam Ahmed was like that. If this is not happening, if there is not a connection, an emotional tie on the level of the Salaf, and want to follow the salaf, &#8212; there is no Tarbiyah. It is not a matter that we need more Tarbiyyah but we need to establish some Tarbiyyah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it becomes a situation where in the hearts there is a love for the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and his companions, and you know when someone loves someone. For when someone loves someone they want to follow him, especially among the youth, when they like someone they want to dress like him. Look at the Fitnah that took place when that Kafir, May Allah guide him to Islam, that feminine individual called Michael Jackson his effect, the ideas on those who are living in Saudia.  I&#8217;ve seen it myself, can you imagine someone in the city of Muhammed (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) Medina, can you imagine someone who is living in Haramain, wants to move his hands, and wear his hair and have a jacket on like Michael Jackson. This is the absence of Tarbiyyah and we don&#8217;t have to go that far. We can come to our own neighbourhoods, we can look in our own Masjids &#8212; to the right, to the left and look to how individuals act and we can see whether or not if there is any importance placed on following the way of the Salafus Saalih &#8212; in reality not just in talk. So it is important that there be this matter of obtaining knowledge and a reflection and of learning new matters and of review and there should be a times where we  use the Tabliqi bidhi term &#8216;sacrifice  for dawah.&#8217; But the True Dawah not the innovative Dawah, the Dawah tul Kitab us-Sunnah, the Dawahtud Tawhid, there must be times where we have an individual effort of trying to give somebody Dawah &#8212; of the good that Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has given us. Knowing the hadith of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) when he said : &#8216;if Allaah guides upon your hands one individual, it is better for you than the red camels.&#8217; – which was the most expensive property amongst the Arabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There should be dawah and there should be times for the remembrance of Allaah. Yes, times for the remembrance of Allaah, like recitation of Quraan. All of these for what? So that one can guide oneself and preserve oneself, and make sure one is sticking to the Deen of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason for &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; misguidance after having guidance, decrease after having increase, unrighteousness after having being righteous, belittling the sins – they look at sins as light, istihaadat az zunoob &#8212; (they try to figure out if it is a Major sin &#8216;Kabair&#8217; or a minor sin &#8216;as-Saghaair&#8217;)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The salafs used to say : &#8216;don&#8217;t look whether the sins are major or minor but look at the greatness of the one who you are  disobeying.&#8217; Don&#8217;t look at whether the sin is major or minor when they split that into that Major or Minor it wasn&#8217;t for the purpose for an individual to take it lightly, just like when they slit Bid&#8217;ah up into Mukaffarah – (Bi&#8217;dah that makes you a Disbeliever) or Bid&#8217;ah Mufasikah – (Bi&#8217;dah that makes you a Faasiq); it wasn&#8217;t for the point that it is easy. Qullu Bid&#8217;ahthin Dalaalah &#8211; every Bid&#8217;ah is going astray. Similarly, all Haraam actions must be avoided. As a matter of fact it is understood that many fires are lit by the smallest pieces of wood and that pebble after pebble after pebble you have a mountain there, and the believer sees sin as related by Mujaahid in Bukhari : &#8220;As if a mountain was ready to fall upon him and a Hypocrite sees this sin as a fly all he has to do is use his hand to shoosh it away&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at matters as seemingly light is another reason why people backup after they were going forward becoming unrighteousness after having being righteous. Abdallah Ibn Mubarak (the great Imam from the Aimma of the Salaf) used to say in a piece of poetry &#8220;I saw that sins kill the heart&#8221; and the person who commits sins inherits humiliation if he continues upon those sins. And that leaving sins gives life to the heart. And the best thing that you can do for yourself is to disobey it. The best thing that you can do for yourself is to disobey yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The self wants many things, the self wants temporary satisfaction at the cost of destruction and punishment that it can&#8217;t bear. The self wants ease and relaxation and a fulfillment of desires on the spot, &#8216;ASAP&#8217;, as they say, want it now, instantly &#8212; (as soon as possible). This is how the self is, that&#8217;s why he says Khairun linafsika &#8211; it is better for yourself to disobey it. And you&#8217;ll find every time  you disobey yourself you come out better. Every time you disobey your desires you come out  better. I was planning, I started to do it but I disobeyed, You come out better. And the best thing you can do for yourself is to disobey it. So the sins, and belittling them, &#8216;al-israaru&#8217; continuing upon the sin, it is of the most important reasons or causes why a person goes bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look into it clearly, look with some clarity, be meticulous in your analysis of it and you find that many individuals who have backed up, they have no problem sinning, it&#8217;s a light thing. They listen to some music and they say : &#8216;I am listening to some music is it a Kabirah? Is it a major sin? I thought that it was okay among scholars.&#8217;… and all this foolishness. It is a matter that is disobedience to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala  and major or minor one should avoid it. Out of respect for Allaah, like in Suratun Nuh, &#8220;Would you not  have respect for Allaah?&#8221; So this is an important matter, some of us respect the creation, and can see and understand that, I won&#8217;t step on Islaam, I respect it, I won&#8217;t do this, I respect him. But this is Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s sanctuary, those things that he has forbidden. So where is the respect from not falling into that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim, Sheikhul Islaam (Rahimahullah) said &#8220;From the punishment of the sin is that it weakens ones strength or the heart in its connection in its journey to Allaah.&#8221; We explained before that we are in this world journeying to Allaah. This is a journey and it is just as the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) described Maali wad Dunya, what is meant by the Dunya? Except like a traveller who slept under a tree, just a relaxation, got up and moved on.&#8221; It&#8217;s a journey to Allaah, and it&#8217;s a journey back to our country, and our country is the Jannah, because our father Adam (alai wa sallam) came from there. No matter how many generations or how many people go somewhere else, you come from the country of your father. So you return to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah says : we have been oppressed and imprisoned by our enemy, taken prisoners of war by Iblis, now if we break from that and break from disobedience to Allaah and come  to obedience to Allaah in our journey to Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala and having Ikhlas, khawf,  having Taqwa having hope, having trust, and having submission and so on and so forth of the levels of the journey, then we will eventually get back to our country, no doubt about that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has explained the Siraat, the path. We&#8217;ve got the map, we&#8217;ve got the directions, we know the Zaad al Maad &#8211; the provision for the Hereafter, we got the provisions, it is just a matter of staying upon the path and continuing our journey. The sins are blocks and obstacles and they cause weakness in this journey, weakness in the journey of the heart to the Hereafter and obstacles and they may even cut one off from the path. The sin would be similar to a highway robber coming to you and taking your provision and kicking you off the road and leaving you in the middle of the desert. The sin would be similar to a mountain  being in your way, and you cant move it and you can&#8217;t get a around it. So it weakens it. He says this obstacle cuts off ones path of sin or weakens one, that it doesn&#8217;t do worse than that, which is to turn a person all the way around and send him travelling in a totally different direction. So the sin is a veil, and veils of darkness that stop an individual from achieving or continuing on his journey and they can turn around his search. The heart travels to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala upon this journey with the strength that Allaah  blesses it with. So if the heart becomes sick from sins and it becomes weak, this strength is gone and therefore what is the situation with its ability to continue the journey? Its ability to continue the journey is very weak. So this is Ibn Qayyim&#8217;s point, even though I said in a very articulate way, you can see that that&#8217;s the case. Belittling sins have results, disastrous, dangerous results upon individuals who belittles or looks down or thinks sins are light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First or one of the results rather is that it makes a person increase in sin. It is like a call that says, &#8216;what is this is light, let me do some more  let me fall into it some more, let me acquire some more&#8217;, and it is that which takes a person far away from the path of Tawbah. Tawbah was something close when the sin was first committed or when it was the matter of understanding the greatness of sin or how harmful it is but when it is made lighter, tawbah is something far away from the mind of the individual. And it calls an individual to have absence of avoiding the people of sin. It means to say, because the individual is involved in sin, has no problem with other individuals involved in sin. I am involved in sin, he&#8217;s involved in sin, so therefore they start to hang out with other sinners, the bad crowd, the bad guys, the bad people, the type of fellows you don&#8217;t want to be around. Talk to them, sit with them , mix with them. Sins could also cause an individual many times, of course based upon this, to stay away from the people who are righteous. I don&#8217;t want to be around the brothers who are righteous, I don&#8217;t want to see right now the brothers who have Taqwa. This alone is one of the biggest or greatest means of a person going astray after once before they were upon the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another issue of the issues or reasons of &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; unrighteousness after being righteous, being corrupt after having being one who was upright is al-ghuroor – being delusioned or having Self delusion, self delusion &#8216;wal ijaab&#8217; &#8211; astonishment or amazement with oneself. This you find among many of those who believe that they are sticking to the Kitab as-Sunnah, who believe that they are righteous, they have this ghuroor, and they have this ijaab and everyone can understand the difference between illusion and a delusion.  Illusion is when you see something and you know its not real, delusion is that you believe that something be real when it&#8217;s not. So they believe that they have this righteousness, this greatness sometimes they call this &#8216;the holier than thou attitude, and this ujoo – this astonishment with oneself, is that you find this a lot, he said no doubt that&#8217;s in the cities of knowledge, being around righteous people, show that a person has some good within him. But if this self delusion and astonishment enters upon a person, it has the effect of making this person feel they are perfect or that they are more complete than others. Therefore he doesn&#8217;t feel the need to  increase his effort. I&#8217;m doing well, I&#8217;m doing fine, I&#8217;m righteous, no need to do anymore, I attend circles of knowledge, those are the people who don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m in the Masjid other people aren&#8217;t.  So this type of ghuroor or amazement, so therefore this individual doesn&#8217;t try to do more khair, doesn&#8217;t try to do more righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person becomes astonished with oneself there comes away from his heart the fear of a bad ending. And he feels safe from being lead astray after having guidance, and this is a sign from the weakness of his self and it is one of the means of a person turning away and going the wrong direction, and getting misguided after having guidance. And when one becomes amazed and astonished with oneself he begins to become busy with the faults of others and he doesn&#8217;t try to deal with the faults of himself. And because the self needs to be dealt with so therefore this ghuroor must be dealt with, this ghuroor &#8212; this self delusion, this amazement, I&#8217;m more righteous, I&#8217;m more good, I&#8217;m on Istiqaamah, I have  more Ilm and safety from Dalalah. How can one feel safe from Dalaalah &#8212; being lead astray? There are two matters and both of them are kufr :<br>
1)    One of them is  to lose hope in the Mercy of Allaah – to give up</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2)     The other, is to feel safe from the plotting of Allaah. To feel safe from Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala punishing one for ones misdeeds. Safe !!! That is also Kufr. It is Kufr, so this has to be understood also. This has to be dealt with. How do you deal with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many righteous matters or morals that one must obtain is by doing the opposite of it. If one finds himself selfish, it is for him to become generous; If one finds Himself arrogant it is for him to be humble. Similarly, in this way he has to have humility, he has to have fear, and he has to work on the correction of his faults before starting with anyone else. Work on his faults before starting on his wife; work upon his faults before starting on his children; work upon his faults before starting on this brother and that brother, this community and that community. &#8220;Islaah&#8221; &#8211; start with oneself first and Tawbah – repenting to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ll try to wrap it up. Another reason why people go astray after having been upon guidance, going from Sunnah to Bi&#8217;dah or from righteousness to sins is their companions &#8216;as-Sadeeq wa saahib&#8217; &#8212; their companions. The people you sit with has this effect, has an affect upon the person&#8217;s path and behaviour. There is no doubt about that. If the friend that one is with looks at bad films or looks at bad magazines or listens to music and that will have an effect upon the one who is a companion with him. These type of mukhalafaat &#8211; or matters that are disobedient comes in between two companions and the companion doesn&#8217;t forbid it but rather he lets that slide, lets this one slide and pretty soon it has an effect upon him. Has an effect upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore you could have a companion also, but of course this is lesser of an evil than that, one who is short in his Ibadah &#8212; he is short in his worship so he stops doing Sunnan &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t do Sunnah Raatiba, he stops doing Sunnah raatiba. This is the effect of what? Companionship !! And it can go to such a level that if your friend backs up and if your companion backs up, you back up. So therefore, you must choose a righteous companion. The one who will help one be upon obedience to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. Like it says in the Hadith &#8216;Ar Rajlu ala deeni khaleeli&#8217; the man is upon the Deen of his friend, so look to who you befriend&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other reasons that lead to this misguidance after having being guidance, weak eemaan after having strong eemaan, and sometimes as we say Bid&#8217;ah after having being on Sunnah, Kufr and shirk after having being on eemaan and Tawhid. One of it is having weakness in ones strength or sticking and not having the patience to deal with the difficulty. The one upon the Deen of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will be tested and there will be storms of fitnah, the fitnah of desires and the Fitnah of doubt. There will be good days, there will be happy days, there will be nicest situations, there will be circumstances that are difficult. This requires a person with strength and steadfastness and sticking and patience to deal with those type of matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another matter is &#8216;Taw al amal&#8221; &#8212; having this view point that your going to live along time, when death is closer than the shoe laces!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wal-Ghuloo&#8221; &#8212; being extreme is another reason with some people. You find them extreme over night. Overnight his thobe&#8217;s to his ankle, over night he is on Sunnah, over night he has books of Aqeedah, over night, over night, over night he is so hard upon the people and extreme and the next day or two days later or a year later he doesn&#8217;t have a beard, he doesn&#8217;t even come to Masjid. &#8216;Ghuloo&#8217; &#8211; extreme. And be shadeed upon himself, placing upon ones shoulder what one cannot bear, more than one cannot bear, forgetting the fact that Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala does not place a burden upon a soul more than he can bear.  Some of us make the Deen hard, some of us that make it extreme. The prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) would not have the choice between two matters both of them being Halaal except he would chose the what? the easier. We act as if we can better than Mustafa (alaihi wa sallam). &#8220;I want the hardest.&#8221; This is not the way and this leads to a person backing up because the self can only take so much, so therefore after a year of this extremism one comes to a point of saying, &#8216;what am I doing?&#8217; &#8212; and backs up from everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also &#8216;am-Muraad al Quloob&#8217; &#8211; the illnesses of the heart , &#8216;wa afaatul Lisaan&#8217; &#8211; and the mistakes of the tongue. And illnesses of the heart are many &#8216;Riya&#8217;—to be seen, &#8216;Kibr&#8217; &#8211; pride so on and so forth, or sicknesses of the tongue like &#8216;Gheebah&#8217; &#8212; backbiting, &#8216;Nameemah&#8217; &#8211; slander so on and so forth, lying and cursing and all of this. These are also means that lead to what? a person being unrighteous after they were righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason he says is &#8216;Da&#8217;fash sha&#8217;khsiyyah&#8217; &#8212; that the person within himself has a weak personality. And therefore finds himself always following other personalities. So if he has a weakness in personalities, and his Islamic  personality is weak, he finds himself following other personalities. This will also eventually lead a person turning away after they were straight, or being misguided after they had guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reasons. We must mention some of the remedies to make it balanced Insha&#8217;allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most important issue he says is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Al-Ikhlas&#8217; &#8211; sincerity and &#8216;was-Sidq&#8217; &#8211; truthfulness with Allaah. This is the best means of achieving &#8216;Istiqaamah&#8217; &#8211; uprightness and Salah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim (Rahimullah) says, &#8220;One finds difficulty to leave that which one is used to and what is ones habit &#8211; what one leaves for other than Allaah. But the one who leaves matters of disobedience and sins and those things that are wrong for Allaah and leave them truthfully, sincerely for Allaah, he only finds difficulty in the beginning of leaving it , and this is how Allaah tests him to see if he is truthful or not or he is lying. He wants to leave his sin that he&#8217;s being doing, saying that I am sincere to Allaah, Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala may give him the opportunity and test him. He&#8217;ll find some difficulty at first, and this is to see if he is truthful. If he is truthful he will fight himself, he&#8217;ll fight his desires, he&#8217;ll strive to go against it and if he is lying that won&#8217;t be the case. He says he will find difficulty, but the one who is patient upon this difficulty &#8216;kaleelan&#8217; – a little, Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will place, in place of that desire or for that sin, a sweetness and a love, and a deliciousness for that which is right, that which is good&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An this has been narrated in many Ahadith that he who leaves looking at that which is Haraam, Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will give him (some of the Hadith says) courage and Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will give him strength and that&#8217;s what you find, those who have the most courage and the most strength is those who turn their eyes, keep their eyes away from that which Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has forbidden. He who leaves something for Allaah, Allaah will give him better than that.<br>
&#8216;Man taraka shai&#8217;in lillaah&#8217; &#8212;  Allaah gives him better than that all the time. Leave this sin, Allaah will give a righteous deed better than that &#8212; of course it&#8217;s not the sin itself, (righteousness is better) &#8212; but what he means is that Allaah will replace it with something that you could not have imagined, something that you could not have imagined, but he has to be what Sabr &#8211; Patience, it has to be a willing to go through the examination and the test.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter as mentioned before is &#8216;al-khawf min sural khaatimah&#8217; &#8211; fear of a bad ending. The Mumin-as- Sadiq the true believer must fear a bad ending and stay away from anything that will lead to that. Did you not hear what Yusuf (alai salaam) said, &#8220;Oh Alaah, cause me to die as a Muslim and place me with the righteous,&#8221; and all the Prophets of Allaah were making dua like that. They were making dua for what? for a good ending, that they die upon Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sufyaan athawri (Rahimullaah), that great Imam, that great Sheikh of Islam, cried one night, cried one night all the way till morning, (you think our crying is something?)  He did not cry for 15 minutes or half hour, cried all the way from night till morning. When he was asked, &#8220;Why are you crying or why did you cry?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I cried from having an evil end from the fear from having an evil end.&#8221; This is why he cried and called Imaam Barbahaari, the one who is the Sheikh-al-Sunnah (radiallaahu anhu)   who said &#8220;You must know that it is a must upon the servant that he has with him &#8216;as-Shafaqah abadan&#8217; &#8211; a mercy and a fear connected at all times because he doesn&#8217;t know upon what he would die, he doesn&#8217;t know how his life would end and he doesn&#8217;t know in what condition he would meet Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. Therefore, he should be doing what? Every deed of good he can, every deed of good he can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another help in this regard is to continuously do the righteous action, don&#8217;t start one action, a righteous action and then stop, i.e. start Qiyamul Layl or Tahajjud and then stop, start memorizing the Quraan and then stop, verily the deeds most loved by Allaah are those which are done regularly, (continuously) even if they are a small amount. Also taking certain times to hear admonition &#8216;Maw&#8217;idah&#8217;, the Hereafter, the grave, &#8212; not everyday &#8212; that&#8217;s not the way of the Salafus Saalih, but every so often. As Ibn Masud said, that the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) used to choose times to give us &#8216;Maw&#8217;idah&#8217; because if you do it everyday fearing that we become bored with it. And there are other means of making sure, or hoping, because no one can make sure except Allaah, but hoping that one will be upon Istiqaamah.  This is just some that we were able to mention in this sitting. We hope that it benefits us and it benefits all who listen, we ask Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala to make it sincerely for His face not having in it any Riya or summ&#8217;ah, verily Allaah is able to do all that. Wassallaahu ala nabi ina Muhammad wa&#8217;ala as-haabihee ajma een.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Introduction to his booklet: &#8220;<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa&#8217;ikah</i><br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that exists, and may the peace and blessings be upon our prophet, Muhammad, as well as upon his family and all of his Companions. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Eemaan (Faith) is a great matter, since it is the foundation upon which success in this life and the next rests on. So it is one of the most important levels of the Religion, for when the angel, Jibreel, came to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) in the presence of his Companions, he asked him about Islaam, Eemaan, and Ihsaan, saying: “O Muhammad! Inform me about Islaam.” The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: <b>“Islaam is to testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; to establish the prayer; to give the Zakaat; to fast in Ramadaan; and to perform the Hajj to the House (Ka’bah) if you are able to.”</b> So he explained Islaam as being the implementation of these five pillars: (!) The two testimonies of Faith; (2) Establishing the Prayer; (3) Giving the Zakaat; (4) Fasting in Ramadaan; (5) Pilgrimage to the Ka’bah. So the angel Jibreel told him: “You have spoken the truth. Now inform me about Eemaan.” The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Al-Qadar – the good of it and the bad of it.”</b> So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) explained that Eemaan was to believe in these six things: Belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and Al-Qadar – the good of it and the bad of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel continued: “Inform me about Ihsaan.” So the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) responded: <b>“Ihsaan is to worship Allaah as if you see Him. But if you don’t see Him, then verily, He sees you.”</b> So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) clarified that Ihsaan consists of one pillar, which is to worship Allaah as if you see Him. But if you don’t see Him, then verily, He sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the three levels of the Religion: Islaam, then Eemaan, then Ihsaan. Each one of these levels has its own set of pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A pillar is the part upon which something stands on. So the pillar of a house refers to the part upon which that house is established. So Eemaan (Faith) rests upon six of these pillars. If one of these pillars is missing, a person is no longer a believer, possessing Faith, since he lacks one of the pillars of Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Eemaan cannot be established except upon its pillars, just like a building cannot be established except upon its pillars. These six pillars (of Eemaan) are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan. Sometimes they are mentioned altogether and other times they are mentioned separately, as Allaah says: <b>“But rather piety (birr) is he who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 177] Allaah mentions five of the pillars of Eemaan in this ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what was revealed to him from his Lord and (so do) the believers – all of them believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. We do not differentiate between any of His Messengers.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 285]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions four of these pillars here. And sometimes, He just mentions two of these pillars: Belief in Allaah and the Last Day, as He says: <b>“Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabians – whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions two pillars in this ayah: Belief in Allaah and the last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for belief in Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree), then that is mentioned in His statement: <b>“Verily, We created everything with Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree).”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying: <b>“He has created everything, and assigned its Decree to it.” </b> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Belief in the Angels:</b><br>
The subject, which we are focusing on now, is the Belief in the Angels, which is one of the pillars of Eemaan. What Belief in the Angels entails is: Believing in their existence and believing in the duties that they carry out in the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the angels are one of Allaah’s creations, which He created for the purpose of worshipping Him and carrying out His orders in the universe. Allaah sends His angels in order to execute His Commands. So they are a creation from the world of the Unseen. We don’t see them, yet we believe in them with a firm resolution that doubt cannot penetrate. This is since Allaah has informed us about them, and likewise, His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) has informed us about them in such a definitive manner that causes us to believe in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What were the Angels created From? </b><br>
The Angels were created from light, as is reported in a hadeeth that Allaah created the angels from light and He created the devils from fire and He created the humans from dirt. So the angels were created from light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Attributes of the Angels: </b><br>
The angels are one of Allaah’s creations from the world of the Unseen. No one knows how many in number they are, their manner of being or their natures except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>From their Attributes: </b><br>
<b>First: </b>They are the greatest of Allaah’s armies. Allaah says: <b>“And to Allaah belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth.”</b> [Surah Al-Fat’h: 4] And whilst talking about the guardians of the Hellfire, He mentioned: <b>“Over it are nineteen (angels).”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 30] And He says: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire, and We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this means that there are nineteen angels guarding the Hellfire – they maintain it, guard it, kindle it and are entrusted with its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one of the disbelievers heard of the number of angels that are guarding the Hellfire, he said, as if to mock their amount: “I will suffice you over them” – meaning if he enters the Hellfire, he will confront them, overpower them and get out of the Hellfire. He said this in order to mock and ridicule, so Allaah refuted them by saying: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31] This means they will not be from among the humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this person claims that he is strong and that he is able to fight against a number of humans, he will not be able to fight against even one of the angels. Allaah says: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31] This means: “We did not make them humans or jinn.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “And We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve, in order that the people of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in Faith, and so that no doubts may be left for the people of the Scripture and the believers, and so that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the disbelievers may say: ‘What did Allaah intend by this example.’”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they lie and seek to belittle this number. How can this great Hellfire, which contains all of these creatures, only be maintained by nineteen? Allaah says: <b>“And We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one knows the greatness of the angels and no one knows what Allaah has with Him from armies in the heavens and the earth except for Allaah. Neither these disbelievers nor anyone else knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>The angels have great physical composure, as Allaah mentioned this about them in His saying: <b>“All praise is for Allaah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth – who made the angels messengers with wings – two or three or four.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that there are some angels that have two wings, some that have three and some that have four. And there are some angels that have more wings than that, for the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw the angel Jibreel and he had 600 wings – each wing blocking the horizon. This is just one of the many angels that exist. Allaah described him as being mighty in power, as He says: <b>“He (Muhammad) has been taught (this Qur’aan) by one mighty in power.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 5] He is referring to Jibreel. <b>“Free from any defect, then he rose (and became stable).”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 6] This means that he possesses strength and a beautiful appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: </b>The angels possess great power, by Allaah’s permission. What indicates their great strength is that if Allaah commands just one of them, then indeed he is able to let out an awful cry in the world, thus destroying the creation, as occurred with the people of Thamood, who were seized by a loud scream. Jibreel unleashed one powerful scream upon them: <b>“Verily, We sent against them a single sayhah (awful cry), and they became like the dry straw of fences.”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their hearts ceased to function within their bodies and as a result they died and became like dry straw. It was from the custom of the Arabs that when they would settle in a place, they would gather sticks of wood and make fences to surround their sheep and cattle. These fences would eventually dry up and become pieces of straw. So in spite of Thamood’s power and might, they became like dried-up straws as a result of one loud cry from one of the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also commanded Jibreel to raise up the towns of the people of Loot – and they were seven cities in which could be found humans, buildings, goods and animals. He carried them on one side of his wing and raised these cities until the (other) angels heard the barking of dogs and the crowing of roosters. Then he overturned them and Allaah caused the earth to swallow them up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example of the mighty power of the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the angel Israafeel, the angel that is entrusted with blowing the Trumpet. What is meant by the Trumpet is a horn that will gather the souls of the son of Aadam (i.e. humans), from the first of them to the last of them. Then Israafeel will blow one time on the Trumpet, and the souls will fly about due to this blow of the horn, going back to their bodies. This is known as the Blow of Resurrection (<i>Nafkhat-ul-Ba’ath</i>). Prior to this, he will strike the Blow of Destruction (<i>Nafkhat-us-Sa’aq</i>), so everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth will die except for he whom Allaah wills. Allaah says: <b>“And the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and in the earth will swoon away except for he whom Allaah wills.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Swooning away means to die. Then he will blow on the Trumpet again, which is known as the Blow of Resurrection, <b>“and behold, they will be standing, looking.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just one of Allaah’s angels, and this is just one of his duties, which Allaah has ordered him to carry out. So therefore, the angels are one of Allaah’s great creations. He created them so that they may worship Him and carry out His commands. Allaah says: <b>“Rather, they are honorable slaves. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command. He knows what is before them and what is after them. and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</b> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 26-28]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><strong>Question</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Islaamic Bank has shares for sale and the value of each share is one hundred and ten US dollars ($110). And that which we have understood is that the bank in question does not trade in ribaa and that the money from the sale of the shares will be used in trading activities which are free from any dealings in interest. The profits will then be divided amongst the shareholders. So out of concern of falling into that which is impermissible, we request you to give a fatwa about whether this is permissible or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to have shares in a bank which does not trade in ribaa, and the profits which accrue from these shares are the result of trading which is not haraam , so it is halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling about having shares in companies and banks&#8217;? And is it permissible for a shareholder (in a company or a bank) to sell shares, specifically after he has become a shareholder himself, to offices dealing in buying and selling (stockbrokers)? And from that which is possible is selling them (the shares) for more than the price that the shareholder paid. So what is the ruling about the profit which the shareholder makes every year from the value of the shares bought?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having shares in banks and companies that trade in ribaa is not permissible. And if the shareholder wants to rid himself of any ribaa in his shareholding, then he should sell his shares at market value and take the initial investment only. The rest he should give in charity, and it is not permissible for him to take anything from the profits of his shareholding or interest. However, if the shareholding was in a company which does not trade in ribaa, then it&#8217;s profits are halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">By al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overview</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee?<br>
He is from amongst the senior (eldest) students of Imaam Muqbil Ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah), to the extent that Shaykh Muqbil referred to Shaykh Muhammad as &#8216;my khaleefah.&#8217; His specialty is in Fiqh (Islaamic jurisprudence), and he has a centre of Islaamic studies in Hudaydah, Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Lecture :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee states, &#8216;If the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards gaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned and carries these legislated means out, he will have gained what has been promised to him. Sometimes these doors are called the door towards attaining sustenance or the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the doors are :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness in the Religion) : Allaah says, &#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217; So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, a door from the doors of sustenance.<br>
2. Eemaan (Faith) : al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief of difficulty, a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision). &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and his books, and his angels, the last day, qadr (divine decree), its good and it&#8217;s bad, the Qur&#8217;aan, the Rasool (Messenger), the pure prophetic Sunnah and what is contains.<br>
3. Taqwaa (Fear and consciousness of Allaah) : &#8216;And if the people of the towns had Taqwaa and had piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn..&#8217; Whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah provides for him from where he would never have expected, where his mind would never have though about. However, Taqwaa of Allaah provided these means for him and gave him ease.<br>
4. Tawakkal ilallaah (having trust in Allaah) : If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.<br>
5. Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : Not giving shukr decreases one&#8217;s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. &#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.&#8217;<br>
6. Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : A person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br>
7. Zakaat (Charity) : It is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with Zakaat, it is from the five pillars of Islaam. Give Zakaat from the apparent and the non-apparent, from the jewellery and possessions.<br>
8. Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : &#8216;Spending on one&#8217;s parents, family and companions. The angels make du&#8217;aa for the one who spends, that Allaah replenishes them, and another makes du&#8217;aa that the one who refrains from spending that his wealth is destroyed. Allaah says &#8216;whoever does even an atoms worth he will see it and whoever spends in the path of Allaah, Allaah will replace it&#8217;.<br>
9. Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) : Allaah says, &#8216;Call on Me and I will answer you&#8217;. Allaah orders us to supplicate; supplication should be made for one&#8217;s rizq. &#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this life and the hereafter and save us from the Fire&#8217;. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to say this du&#8217;aa.<br>
10. al-Birr (The Righteous) : A door from the doors of relief, &#8216;Verily the pious people will be in the paradise and the evil doers will be in the hellfire Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) stated that this ayah refers to the dunyaa (worldly life), the barzakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aakhirah (hereafter) contrary to what people comprehend.<br>
11. Material Means : The means from the material means are also from the means of sustenance but self-control must be observed, knowing that dependency is upon Allaah alone. It is merely a means by which you work. We Should say &#8216;O Allaah, this is the means by which you provide for me if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah provided we wouldn&#8217;t have used it. When Maryam (alayhis-salaam) was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says &#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm before you and it will provide ripe dates for you. We are not dervishes who do nothing, we work by the means but we do not go by means which are unlegislated by Allaah. Many of those who are obsessed with their means fall to diabetes and Cancer, their minds obsessed with their work.<br>
12. Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : And if only they had established the Toraah and the Injeel, they would have eaten from above them and under their feet.&#8217; If this is in regards to those who should have held on to the scriptures then it is pivotal to hold on to the book and the Sunnah. We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mention the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura&#8217;an and of the Messenger has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called &#8216;Abwaabur Rizq&#8217; or &#8216;Abwaabul Furaj&#8217; i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say &#8216;Abwaabul Rizq&#8217; – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say &#8216;Asbaabur Rizq&#8217; i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura&#8217;an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :<br>
1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah) : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says,<br>
&#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217;<br>
So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the &#8216;Asbaab-al-Shar&#8217;eeah&#8217; – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn&#8217;t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We made all things living from water.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :<br>
&#8216;and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.&#8217;<br>
And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That is verily those who say, &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, &#8216;have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.<br>
Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Maad&#8217; that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid&#8217;ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no &#8216;liwaath&#8217; &#8212; no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no &#8216;shahaadatuz zoor&#8217; &#8212; bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn&#8217;t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.<br>
And the second means is Eemaan and Taqwa : i.e the second and third. Now we have three means, Eemaan and Taqwa. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :<br>
&#8221;And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwaa or piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied or denied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn. Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the plan of Allaah except the people who are losers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first three means he returns he says with the ayah : walaw anna ahlal Qura ..&#8217; and &#8216;Qura&#8217; here encompasses al-Qura wal Mudah. i.e the word Qura means villages and he says this ayah encompasses both villages and cities. And Makkah is the Ummul Qura as you know. This is not specific to villages but on the contrary villages, cities and all. He repeats the ayah :<br>
&#8216;If only the people of the cities had believed and had taqwa, We would have opened for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;<br>
Henceforth al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty, and a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision) and a means from the means Rizq. &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and His Books, and His angels, the Last Day and in Qadr (Divine decree), its good and its bad, the belief or Eemaan in the Qur&#8217;aan and in what the Qur&#8217;aan contains, Eemaan in the Rasool (Messenger) and what he came with from Allaah, Eemaan in the pure prophetic Sunnah and what it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If they believed and had piety, We would have opened up for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He said (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :<br>
&#8216;And whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah makes for him a way out and provides for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br>
The Sheikh reiterates that &#8216;He would have provided for him from where he never would have expected – from where his mind would never have thought about it. And hence not expecting that he would find this prepared blessing, the blessed sustenance from this source. However, taqwa of Allaah prepared for him these different ways and made ease for him the means.&#8217;<br>
The Sheikh reiterates: &#8216;He would make for him a way out and provide for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br>
We want rizq. However we lost gaining it by its legislated ways except whom Allaah has had mercy on. Rizq by lying and playing and zig zagging, stealing and deceit, evil plotting : &#8216;O people&#8217; the Sheikh implores : Is this the way to get rizq? You are right now spreading up the establishment, you are right now speeding up the establishment of punishment on yourself and torment if you disobey Allaah. Therefore why not hold onto the deen and have glad tidings of good and have glad tidings of relief from hardship?<br>
So right now we have three doors : Al-Istiqaamah, al-Eemaan and Taqwa.<br>
The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) &#8216;If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.&#8217;<br>
At-tawakkal alallaah – &#8216;having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.<br>
He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds. That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don&#8217;t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :<br>
&#8216;And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.&#8217;<br>
He is talking about the &#8216;Lawh al Mahfudh&#8217; &#8212; the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.<br>
&#8216; We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates : Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don&#8217;t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don&#8217;t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the &#8216;Musabbibul Asbaab&#8217; – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him. Do cupping for him or cauterization (healing with fire).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said : &#8216;A cure is in three things. In drinking a little bit of honey, or in the line that a person who does cupping draws (puts marks on your skin) or in the using of the fire (cauterization).&#8217; And this is in Bukhari in the Book of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn&#8217;t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn&#8217;t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you&#8217;ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then said something that was not clear and he continued. He made distrust and greed and toil and adverse hardship and they lost the Deen except whom Allaah had mercy on. Now we have four means from the means of sustenance.<br>
The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : &#8216;And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these day Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying &#8216;what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough&#8217;. The people they have and they have and you didn&#8217;t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn&#8217;t for Allaah it wouldn&#8217;t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni&#8217;maah. If it didn&#8217;t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don&#8217;t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh reiterates : &#8216;If you give thanks, We will increase you.&#8217; If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana&#8217;a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah. The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don&#8217;t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don&#8217;t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, &#8216;Spend not on those who are around Allah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don&#8217;t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them :<br>
And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don&#8217;t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don&#8217;t believe except in material things. They don&#8217;t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr &#8212; always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :<br>
&#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah.&#8217;<br>
It is a saying of the Prophet : &#8216;So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn&#8217;t thank Allaah doesn&#8217;t thank the people. &#8216;It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazakallaahu khaira. Don&#8217;t&#8217; say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn&#8217;t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn&#8217;t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.<br>
Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don&#8217;t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn&#8217;t it? It is ni&#8217;maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal? The ni&#8217;mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :<br>
[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) (2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) (3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) (4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br>
Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni&#8217;mah. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alon, you don&#8217;t make vows except for Allaah, and you don&#8217;t swear except by Allaah and you don&#8217;t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.<br>
There must be a firm holding on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and their must be obedience to the Messenger if we want success and salvation in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. So Ash-Shukr is the fifth.<br>
And the sixth : Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : Because Allaah says :<br>
&#8216;Whoever who turns away from the dhikr of Ar-Rahman, We would put for him a shaitaan to be a companion for him.&#8217;<br>
He says :<br>
&#8220;And whoever turns away from My remembrance then verily for him is a wretched life. And We will raise him up on the Day of Judgement blind. He will say, &#8216;O Lord why did you raise me up blind when I used to be able to see?&#8217; He will say that it is the same way that My ayath had come to you and you forgot them and this day, you will be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he went away from the remembrance of Allaah and his obedience, Allaah punished him with a wretched life, hard life, tiresome. However, if he was the opposite i.e if he didn&#8217;t turn away from the remembrance of Allaah on the contrary took towards the remembrance of Allaah and took towards the obedience of Allaah, he will not in this case have wretched life but a pleasant and comfortable life of course. Henceforth pay attention. Those who turn away do not have reward and those who turn to Allaah have a reward i.e. a person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br>
The Sheikh reiterates :<br>
&#8216;Whoever turns away from My remembrance then for him is a wretched life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He turned away from the remembrance of Allaah and the thanks of Allaah and the obedience of Allaah so Allaah punished him with a wretched life. He doesn&#8217;t attain his morsel of livelihood except after a day of great hardship – after having reached the verge of death, after having had a toil of a donkey and the toil of a camel and having seen different forms of death repeatedly, he attains his morsel of livelihood or drink of water. However, if he obeyed Allaah all of his affairs would have been good, his life and livelihood would have been pleasant, comfortable, pure, blessed and henceforth zikrullaah and holding fast to the obedience of Allaah, you will tread in steadfastness and goodness and comfort with the blessing of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala). This is the sixth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh is Zakaat (Charity) : As the Prophet said (reported by Hakim) : If they didn&#8217;t stop preventing from paying their zakaat of their monies except that the rain from the skies was prevented from them. And if it was not for the animals, rain wouldn&#8217;t have fallen upon them. It is a long hadith but this part of the hadith is the point of discussion. &#8216;That they did not prevent from paying their zakaat, of their monies, except that the water from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not have rained upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadith it is clear that if they prevent from giving their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. And if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not fall upon them at all. It does however rain on them &#8212; a mercy from Allaah due to the animals and due to the babies who are not responsible. Therefore not paying zakaat is a means of the prevention of rain from the sky. And if the rain is prevented from the sky, poverty takes place and torment and destruction over the people of the land. So fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of the properties, the apparent and the non-apparent, (the Daahir and the Baatin) &#8212; the non-apparent meaning the gold and the silver in jewellery and these other cash commodities in their different known currencies; and the apparent meaning the cows and sheep and camels and agricultural products. These things that are seen in front of the people. So it is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of his properties : apparent and non-apparent properties. Because zakaat is a pillar from the five pillars of Islaam. And Allaah had made the things that should be spent on in the 8 categories mentioned in surah at-Tawbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Read the ayah. He does not mention it in full. However, I will mention it. In the ayah sadaqaath here means zakaat. They are only for the fuqaraah and the masakeen, (which is a degree higher than a fakeer) and those employed to collect the funds, and to attract the hearts of those who have been attracted to Islaam, to free the captives, to free those in debts and for Allaah&#8217;s cause and for the wayfarer. A duty imposed upon Allaah and Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the people stopped paying their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. The correct statement from the people of knowledge that jewellery of women from gold and silver if it reaches the limits from where one pays the zakaat , then zakaat is upon it if it reaches that limit and one year has passed on that limit. Nasaab or the least amount on which the zakaat should be paid is 80g of gold and 400g from silver. So if the husband owns it, he gives the zakaat. And if the wife owns it she gives the zakaat which is obligatory every year. So, if it is less than 80g maybe 76g and she does not have cash properties then, it is not upon her to pay zakaat. However if it is 76g for instance and she has cash worth such and such grams, then she has to pay zakaat because she has from this cash what would make up for the deficiency in silver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : If people did not stop paying their zakaat, except that the rain from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals rain would not have fallen upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth door of sustenance : Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : Charitable donations, and nafaqaath (regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, your uncles and aunts, your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the door of sustenance. And it has come in the saheehain from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah said : There is not a day that the slaves wake up in it .. everyday that the servant wakes up except that two angels come down and say : one of them says to the other &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that spends , give him something to replace it;&#8217; and he says to the other one : &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that holds back a type of destruction.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said : &#8216;Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says: &#8216;fa mai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it. And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) also says, &#8216;whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of &#8216;He will replace it?&#8217; i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don&#8217;t think that is the end and that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so.&#8217; So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, &#8216;may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?&#8217;<br>
He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: &#8216;Why do you ask?&#8217;<br>
He said: &#8221; I hears a voice from the clouds saying, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?&#8217;<br>
So the owner of the garden says : &#8216;When I plant and then I harvest, I give one-third for me and my family and I take 1/3rd and I give it in charity. i.e I take 1/3rd and roll it back into my garden.<br>
Look at this. What is required from him is only a 10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than give one from 10 or ½ from 10, he gave from 3. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbours. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn&#8217;t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green masha&#8217;Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. They must have had a good reason because their neighbour&#8217;s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress – as-Sadaqa. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Even if they read the Qur&#8217;aan – however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that. We have eight now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth door is ad-Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) &#8212; Don&#8217;t forget ad-Du&#8217;aa O&#8217; Servants of Allah. Its affair is enormous. And your Lord said : &#8216;Call on me and I will answer you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Du&#8217;aa is if you said something like :<br>
&#8216;Allahummar-ziqni&#8217; &#8212; O Allaah provide for me.<br>
Rizqan Halaalan&#8217; – a Halaal rizq.<br>
&#8216;Tayyiban&#8217; – pure<br>
&#8216;Mubarakan&#8217; &#8212; blessed<br>
&#8216;And make what you provided for us something a means of help – that would help us in your obedience.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;O Allaah it is your rizq that is pure and halaal.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;O Allaah make me be free with your halaal &#8212; from having to deal with anything that is haraam. To be free from needing anything except your bounty.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have supplicated to Allaah asking for good sustenance because he ordered you to supplicate.<br>
Allaah ordered you to supplicate and He has promised you that He will answer. And what do you think, du&#8217;aa is for something else and not for rizq? No, it is even for rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions from the supplications from His righteous slaves : &#8216;O Allaah give us in this world the good and in the Hereafter the good and save us from Fire.&#8217; – And from the good of the Dunya is halaal sustenance that helps you in the obedience of Allaah. And the Hadith of Anas in the saheehain that he said : &#8216;Every time the Prophet used to make dua, he used to make dua with this du&#8217;aa :<br>
Rabbana Aaathina fid-Dunyaa hasana wafil Aaakhirathi hasana wa kina azaabannaar.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this world and the good in the Hereafter and save us from the<br>
Hell-Fire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, du&#8217;aa its affair is great. So supplicate to your Lord to give you good sustenance and halaal provision and pure sustenance, blessed provision and beneficial sustenance and you should ask Him to satisfy you with halaal and not with haraam and to make you satisfied with His bounties and not in need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say in between the two sajdaas in salaah :<br>
Rabbigh firli warhamni, wajburni, ….<br>
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me and have mercy on me, make me firm, guide me, comfort me and sustain me.&#8217;<br>
Between the two sajdaas in every salaah and sometimes he would say<br>
&#8216;Rabbighfir lee, Rabbigh firlee.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me, O Allaah forgive me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how many hadiths with regard to seeking rizq or sustenance from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and this is considered from the means as you have heard from the legislated means. So now we have nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is al-Birr (The Righteous) – &#8216;Al-Birr al Waalidain&#8217; having piety towards the parents, its affair is great. And it is a door from the doors of relief from grief, and it is a door from the doors of rizq and it is a means from the means of rizq. Allaahu (azzawajal) says :<br>
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem. Wa innal fujjaara lafee jaheem.&#8217;<br>
&#8216;Verily the (Abraar) the pious people are going to be in Paradise and the (Fujjaar) the wicked, evil doers will be in the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) mentions in his book &#8216;Madaarijus Saadiqeen&#8217; – the people who check the course &#8212; in the first volume that the one that thinks that Naeem and Jaheem i.e the Paradise and the Fire in this ayah will only be on the Day of Judgement, then he has misconstrued the ayah. The ayah is general. So the abraar are in Naeem&#8217; in the Dunya (worldly life), and the Barzaakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aaakhirah (Hereafter). And the Fujjaar – the wicked, evil doers are in Jaheem in the Dunya (worldly life), in the Barzaakh and in the Aakhirah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Naeem, the pleasantry of the Dunya is good provision, halaal provision, pure sustenance, that is a help for you to do righteous deeds. In that case, then be righteous to your parents and ya subhanAllaah. This is something that is tested and proven to be true. Just by if you did good to your parents and by being righteous to them, help them and ask from them du&#8217;aa except that Allaah will provide for you good and fast sustenance as the Prophet said in Saheeh al-Jaami : &#8216;there are two subjects whose punishments are made to come fast. Al-Baghi i.e infringement upon people&#8217;s rights and &#8216;uqooq&#8217; i.e being disobedient to the parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who infringes on the rights of the people, infringes on the rights of the people with oppression, infringes on the rights of the people by insult, infringes on their rights by striking physically, infringes on their rights with transgression and taking their money or striking their bodies or insulting their honour. This &#8216;baab&#8217; or affair &#8212; its punishment comes in this life and fast, i.e. before the Aakhirah and just like this &#8216;al-Uqooq&#8217; – disobedience to the parents. The punishment of disobedience to parents comes fast and the opposite is the same al-Birr and Adl and Insaaf. i.e justice / equity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insha-Allaah you will take the reward now and later. This is the developed understanding of the Hadith and the ayah:<br>
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem&#8221; – Verily the pious people or the people that are the righteous are in the Paradise. So there are &#8216;Naeem&#8217; in their Dunya and their Aakhirah. And from the Naeem is self-contentment. Even if what is in his position is minute. Allaah has given him &#8216;an-Naeem&#8217; in the dunya – he feels contentment with that. He is not like the one that was victim to bankruptcy, feels that he has nothing in his pocket – bankruptcy, he has a lot of burden, always thinking, always angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, the power of Imaan makes him content and comfortable. Allaah is the One who created me and He has been responsible for my sustenance. You have the Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Masood in the Saheehain and it has been mentioned in the 40 Hadith of Imaam Nawawi : Allaah creates the soul in the womb in the fourth month and in the fourth month he sends an angel to write four words : what his sustenance would be, what his work would be, when he would die and whether he would be happy or miserable.<br>
When you are in the stomach of your mother in the fourth month, when the spirit is blown in, this angel is ordered in the writing of these four things and from these is sustenance, how much provision you will get so you will live in the dunya, the measuring of what Allaah has written for you and your rizq in the dunya is the measuring of what Allaah measured for you of rizq and whether you are going to be happy or miserable, what is the appointed time for death and the reason &#8211;– so you walk on a path that Allaah has written for you Azzawajal, you walk on it with your choice because Allaah did not oppress anyone. As He said: &#8216;And I surely am not an oppressor for the servants.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Imaan : the believer in Allaah and the believer in His deen and Shariah, then she should do what is from Imaan – Imaan in al-Qadr &#8212; the good of it and the bad of it. And that Allaah has decreed his sustenance and that his endeavour does not speed up anything and his slowness doesn&#8217;t delay anything in this affair and that the affair is in the hands of Allaahu ta&#8217;ala. So what He wills it is and what He didn&#8217;t, it will not come out to anything. However it is this person who reads the Book of Allaah and ponders over the Book of Allaah and always reads the Sunnah of the Messenger (alaihissalaatu wassalam) and ponders always upom the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is Material Means : The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don&#8217;t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. Whether you were created for the purpose of Allaah (azzawajal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him. And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –&#8211; the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox &#8212;- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by. As you would say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.&#8217;<br>
In the same way you say : &#8216;O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You don&#8217;t depend upon the means. Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah &#8212; and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : &#8216;Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.&#8217; There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes &#8212; people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means &#8212; in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, &#8216;we steal&#8217; and this is a means. The other may say, &#8216;we fornicate&#8217; and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says &#8216;this is a means&#8217; or cheats and deceives and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;<br>
(Even though Allah has informed us thus).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab &#8212; the praying place of the private room, he found her supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this?<br>
She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling &#8216;miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a &#8216;bazzaar&#8217; and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is &#8216;al-Kayyaal&#8217; &#8212; he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a &#8216;sayy aathi&#8217; &#8212;- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them &#8212; his head is filled with problems and he doesn&#8217;t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. And the most important thing is self-contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh door to the doors of sustenance is Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : Holding fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah is considered one of the doors from the doors of sustenance. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) said about the people of the Book : &#8216;that only if they had established the Toraah and the Injeel (what was revealed to them from their Lord) they would have eaten from above them and from under their feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so for the one who holds onto the Tauraat and the Injeel. Then for the one who holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah this the given priority because the Book and the Sunnah is better than the heavenly books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then we have mentioned 12 doors and means from the means of rizq and from this 11 are spiritual and one was physical or material. Material means we mentioned that we should do work that is halaal, not to waste the time of salaah, he sells or buys or manufactures We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mentioned the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever likes that his rizq is widened for him and his life is expanded then he should join family ties. Joining the ties is increase in one&#8217;s rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Hadith of Anas : There used to be 2 brothers at the time of the Messenger and one of them used to work to earn a living and the other one used to go and seek knowledge from the Prophet and he used to worship Allaah. So the one who earned a living complained about his brother to the Prophet and so the Prophet said : &#8216;May be you are giving sustenance to him. i.e may be Allaah made your sustenance plentiful because of you spending upon your brother.&#8217; So the sheikh reiterated saying: maybe you are given rizq because of him. And he said that this might enter under the category of spending on the student on knowledge. So one of the ways of joining ties of relationships is to spend. With this the Sheikh ends the remainder some of the many means of attaining sustenance and getting relief from distress. Wa sallaahu ala nabee ina Muhammad wa &#8216;ala Aaalihi wasahbihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I finally advice myself and you with the taqwa of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to hold fast to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger . May Allaah give us all tawfeeq and He affirms us on His deen and makes us upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling on Insurance, wether it be life insurance or property insurance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insuring one&#8217;s life and property is forbidden; it is not permissible due to the fact that Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation) and usury are involved therein. And Allah &#8211; the Almighty the All-Powerful &#8211; has forbidden all types of dealings that involver usury and dealings in which there is Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation), as a mercy for the (muslim) community and a protection for them for what is harmful to them. Allah &#8211; Most Glorified, Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;where as Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba&#8221; (usury). Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he forbade selling AL-Gharar. And Allah is the granter of success.</p>
