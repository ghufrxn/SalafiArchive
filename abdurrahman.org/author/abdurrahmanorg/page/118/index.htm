		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 6: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Fasting (Kitab Al-Sawm) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>After prayer the second obligatory duty which every Muslim is required toper- form is that of fasting during the month of Ramadan. The word sawm which has been used in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith for fasting means&#8221; to abstain&#8221; ; thus a horse that abstains from moving about or from eating the fodder is said to be sa&#8217;im. In the technical language sawm signifies fasting or abstaining from food and drink and sexual intercourse from the dim beginning of dawn till sunset. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Fasting as an institution for the purification of the soul is common to all Divine religions. The writer of the article on&#8221; Fasting&#8221; in the Encyclopadia Britannica states that&#8221; it would be difficult to name any religious system of any description in which it is wholly unrecognized.&#8221; This institution was well established among the Jews and the Christians. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The records of the Hadith bear ample testimony to the fact that fasting was a common religious practice among the pre-Islamic Arabs too, and they used to observe fast on the tenth of Muharram because it was on this very day that Allah saved Moses and his companions from the clutches of the Pharaoh who was drowned in the sea along with his army. The Arabs and other people too were familiar with fasting as an act of penitence or of propitiation or a preparatory rite before some act of sacramental eating or an initiation or a mourning ceremony. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In Islam fasting is primarily an institution for a spiritual discipline and selfcontrol. It is in fact an exercise in religious devotion in the form of cheerful and willing renunciation, for a definite period, of all the appetites of flesh lawful in themselves (the unlawful ones being ruled out of course). The Qur&#8217;an says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>0 ye who believe! prescribed unto you is fasting even as it was prescribed unto those before you. that haply you may become God-conscious (ii. 183). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Of all the creation of God only man deviates from His path. We will find that two things are mainly responsible for this: the love for material possessions and the tempta- tions of the flesh. Islam has, through the institutions of Zakat and Sadaqat, purged the hearts of its followers from the love of wealth, and has inculcated in him the habit to part with it readily for the sake of God. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Fasting has been ordained as a religious duty for the Muslims for subduing their lust and keeping their appetites well within reasonable bounds so that man may not become their slave and lose control over himself. The Qur&#8217;an clearly states that a man cannot attain salvation unless he learns to restrain his self from low desires.&#8221; And as for him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains himself from low desires, Paradise is surely the abode&#8221; (lxxix. 40-41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The exercise of abstaining from things otherwise lawful in the ordinary course of life, at the behest of Allah, strengthens man&#8217;s morality and self-control and deepens in him the consciousness of the Lord. This is what distinguishes fasting in Islam from fasting in other religions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It should also be borne in mind that fasting does not aim at inflicting punishment upon people or sadding upon them unbearable burdens. The underlying idea behind it is to teach moderation and spiritual discipline so that human temptations may not become so wild and uncontrollable as to flout the commands of the Great Master. To be a true servant of Allah, it is essential that man should be able to conform his behaviour to the moral and spiritual discipline embodied in the Shari&#8217;ah of Islam. One cannot achieve this end if one finds oneself helpless before untamed and turbulent desires. Fasting is indispensable for this moral and spiritual training. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another distinguishing feature of Islamic fasting is that it does not train a person for complete renunication but for perfect and cheerful obedience to the Lord All those things from which man is commanded to abstain during fast, e. g. eating, drinking and sexual intercourse, become permissible for him at the end of the fast. This shows that Islam does not look down upon the appetite of flesh as something ignoble and thus fit to be exterminated root and branch from the human soul. According to Islam, there is nothing profane or ignoble in human personality: both soul and body are sacred and worthy of respect. No aspect is to be ignored and no urge is to be completely curbed. What is required is to keep all these urges well within their proper limits so that none of them transgresses natural bounds and becomes the source of trouble. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>That fasting is an institution for moral elevation can be judged from the fact that Allah does not impose check only upon eating, drinking and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset, but also exhorts His servants to refrain from other foul acts, for ex- ample, backbiting, indulging in foul speech, telling lies, etc. Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If one does not abandon falsehood and other actions like it, God has no need that one should abandon one&#8217;s food and drink (Sahih Bukhari). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The social aspect of fasting in Ramadan is that the whole atmosphere is permeated with religious piety and devotion to Allah. There is one extra congregational prayer, Tarawih, during the night, in which the Qur&#8217;an is recited and the Muslim is reminded of the fact that it was in the month of Ramadan that the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an commenced. The sadaqqt are also given with greater zeal and fervour in this month. Thus the whole Muslim society is inspired by the love of God. Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When Ramadan begins, the gates of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are locked, and the devils are chained (Bukhari and Muslim). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Muhammad Asad, while elucidating the spiritual and moral significance of fast says:&#8221; Twofold I learned, is the purpose of this month of fasting. One has to abstain from food and drink in order to feel in one&#8217;s body what the poor and hungry feel: thus social responsibility is being hammered into human consciousness as a religious postulate. The other purpose of fasting during Ramadan is self-discipline, an aspect of individual morality strongly accentuated in all Islamic teachings (as, for instance, in the total prohibition of all intoxicants, which Islam regards as too easy an avenue of escape from consciousness and responsibility). In these two elements-brotherhood of man and Individual self-discipline -I began to discern nhe outline of Islam&#8217;s ethical out look&#8221; (Road to Mecca, London, 1954, p. 188). </span></p>

I (Fadl) arrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said: When did you see it? I said.: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it yourself? -I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they observed fast and Mu&#8217;awiya also observed fast, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday night. So we would continue to observe fast till we complete thirty (lasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sightidg of the moon by Mu&#8217;awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has commanded us. Yahya b. Yahya was in doubt (whether the word used in the narration by Kuraib) was Naktafi or Taktafi.</span></p>

So we came to Abu Huraira and Abu Bakr had been with us throughout and &#8216;Abd al-Rahman made a mention of it to him, whereupon Abu Huraira said: Did they (the two wives of the Holy Prophet) tell you this?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters that breaking of fast (in a journey) is the final of the two commands (whether one may fast or one may break it), and it is the last command of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) which is to be accepted as final. Zuhri said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) marched on Mecca on the morning of 14th of Ramadan (lit. when thirteen nights had passed).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Ibn&#8217;Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) arrived in Medina and found the Jews observing fast on the day of &#8216;Ashura. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to them: What is the (significance) of this day that you observe fast on it? They said: It is the day of great (significance) when Allah delivered Moses and his people, and drowned the Pharaoh and his people, and Moses observed fast out of gratitude and we also observe it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: We have more right, and we have a closer connection with Moses than you have; so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) observed fast (on the day of &#8216;Ashura), and gave orders that it should be observed.</span></p>

I said: &#8216;Messenger of Allah, there is nothing with us. Thereupon he said: I am observing fast. She said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went out, and there was a present, for us and (at the same time) some visitors dropped in. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came back, I said to him: Messenger of Allah, a present was given to us, (and in the meanwhile) there came to us visitors (a major Portion of it has been spent on them), but I have saved something for you. He said: What is it? I said: It is hais (a compound of dates and clarified butter). He said: Bring that. So I brought it to him and he ate it and then said: I woke up in the morning observing fast. Talha said: I narrated this hadith to Mujahid and he said: This (observing of voluntary fast) is like a person who sets apart Sadaqa out of his wealth. He may spend it if he likes, or he may retain it if he so likes.</span></p>

We sent a messenger to him (in his house in order to inform him about our arrival) and he came to us. There was a mosque near the door of his house, and we were in that mosque, till he came out to us. He said: If you like you may enter (the house) and, if you like, you may sit here (in the mosque). We said: We would rather sit here and (you) relate to us. He (Yahya) then narrated that &#8216;Abdullah b Amr b. al-&#8216;As (Allah be pleased with them) told him: I used to observe fast uninterruptedly and recited the (whole of the) Qur&#8217;an every night. It (the uninterrupted fasting and recital of the Qur&#8217;in every night) was mentioned to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) or he sent for me, and I went to him and he said to me: I have been informed that you fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur&#8217;An) every night. I said: Apostle of Allah, it is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good, whereupon he said: It suffices for you that you should observe fast for three days during every mouth. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this. He said: Your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you; so observe the fast of David, the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), for he was the best worshipper of Allah. I said: Apostle of Allah, what is the fast of David? He said: He used to fast one day and did not fast the other day. He (also) said: Recite the Qur&#8217;an during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it in twenty days; recite it in ten days. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it every week, and do not exceed beyond this, for your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you. He (&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;As) said: I was hard to myself and thus I was put to hardship. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told me: &#8216;You do not know you may live long (thus and bear the hardships for a long time), and I accepted that which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told me. When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the conces- sion (granted by) the Apostle of Allah (may-peace be upon him). This hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Abu Kathir with the same chain of transmitters and he made this addition after these words: During every month, (fasting) for three days, there is for you ten times for every good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a reward for full thirty days). I said: What is the fast of the Apostle of Allah, David? He said: Half of the age (observing fast on alternate days for the whole life). And in the hadith no mention has been made of the recital of the Qur&#8217;an, and he did not say: Your visitor has a right upon you, but (instead) he said: Your son has a right upon you.</span></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: He used to fast one day and break it on the other day, and he did not run (from the battlefield) as he encountered (the enemy).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abdullah b. Amr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to me: &#8216;Abdullah b. Amr, you fast continuously and stand in prayer for the whole of night. If you do like that, your eyes would be highly strained and would sink and lose sight. There is no (reward for) fasting (for him) who fasts perpetually. Fasting for three days during the month is like fasting, the whole of the month. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Observe the fast of David. He used to fast one day and break (the other) day. And he did not turn back in the encounter.</span></p>

When (these nights) were over, he commanded to strike the tent. Then it was made manifest to him that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was in the last ten nights (of Ramadan), and commanded to pitch the tent (again). He then came to the people and said: O people, Lailat-ul-Qadr was made manifest to me and I came out to inform you about it that two persons came contend- ing with each other and there was a devil along with them and I forgot it. So seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan. Seek it on the ninth, on the seventh and on the fifth. I (one of the narrators) said: Abu Sa&#8217;id, you know more than us about numbers. He said: Yes, indeed we have better right than you. I said: What is this ninth, seventh, and fifth?

He (once) decided to observe i&#8217;tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. Zainab (the wife of the Holy Prophet) commanded that a tent should be pitched for her. It was pitched accordingly. And some other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) commanded that tents should be pitched for them too. And they were pitched. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) offered the morning prayer, he looked and found (so many) tents. Thereupon he said: What is this virtue that these (ladies) have decided to acquire? He commanded his tent to be struck and abandoned i&#8217;tikaf in the month of Ramadan and postponed it to the first ten days of Shawwal.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 5: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Zakat (Kitab Al-Zakat) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Of the five fundamentals of Islam, Zakat occupies the second positioin, the first being prayer (salat). This word is derived from Zakd, which means it (a plant) grew. The second derivative of this word carries the sense of purificatin, e. g. Qad aflaha man zakkaha (he is indeed successful who purified himself). The other word used for zakat both in the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith is sadaqa which is derived from sidq (the truth). Both these words are highly meaningful. The spending of wealth for the sake of Allah purifies the heart of man of the love of material wealth. The man who spends it offers that as a humble gift before the Lord and thus affirms the truth that nothing is dearer to him in life than the love of Allah and that he is full prepared to sacrifice everything for His sake. Secondly, zakat is the most effective measure to improve the economic condition of the have-nots. It is not, however, a mere tax, but a form of worship whereby a man comes close to his Lord. The Muslims have, therefore, been enjoined to pay zakat with the same sense of earnestness and devotion in which the seeker of the Lord observes the prayer. The primary motive of zakat is religious and spiritual, while the social and economic aspects are subservient to it. Its social significance is that it awakens in man the sense of brotherhood with less fortunate members of society, and stirs his moral conscience to make sacrifice for their sake. From the economic point of view it discourages hoarding and concentration of wealth and helps its steady and constant flow from the rich to the poor. It is in fact a good means of providing purchasing power to the poor, for ameliorating their hard lot and enabling them to stand on their own legs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It should also be remembered that zakat or sadaqa in Islam is not a voluntary act of charity which a rich man gives to the poor out of his own sweet will, but it is an obligatory act which every Muslim is enjoined upon to perform if he is sincere in his belief in God and the Hereafter. Thus there is no burden of obligation on one who receives zakat, but a sense of thankfulness and gratitude on the part of the giver, since he has been enabled by the recipient to discharge his obligation that he owes to God and society. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O Prophet), take sadaqa (zakat) out of their property-thou wouldst cleanse them and purify them thereby (Qur&#8217;an, ix. 103). And away from it (the Hell) shall be kept the most faithful to duty who gives his wealth, purifying himself (xcii. 17-18). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So much is the importance of zakat in Islam that it has been mentioned at eightytwo places in the Qur&#8217;an in close connection with prayer. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) knew its basic importance in Islam. It is a known fact that after the death of the Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) when some of the tribes, who believed in the oneness of God and observed prayer, refused to pay zakat, the first Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him), in an answer to the advice of Hadrat &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) to show tolerance towards such people. said in explicit terms, By Allah, I would definitely wage war against them who dissociate prayer from Zakat. Zakat is paid on the surplus of wealth which is left over after the passage of a year. It is thus a payment on the accumulated wealth. Leaving aside animals and agricultural yield, zakat is paid at almost a uniform rate of two and a half %. The minimum standard of surplus wealth over which zakat is charged is known as Nisab. It differs with different kinds of property, the most important being 200 dirhams or 521 tolas (nearly 21 oz.) In case of silver, and 20 mithqals or 71 tolas (nearly 3 oz.) in case of gold. The nisab of cash is the same as that of gold and silver. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>As regards the persons to whom zakat is to be paid, they have been clearly described in the Holy Qur&#8217;an: Alms are only for the poor, the needy, the officials charged with the duty of collection, those whose hearts are inclined to truth, the ransoming of captives, those in debt, in the way of Allah, and the wayfarer (ix 60). </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: If any owner of gold or silver does not pay what is due on him, when the Day of Resurrection would come, plates of fire would be beaten out for him; these would then be heated in the fire of Hell and his sides, his forehead and his back would be cauterized with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) repeated during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the camel? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner of the camel does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him, as extensive as possible, (he will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep? He said: It any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them would be made to return to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment would be pronounced among the servants. And he would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse? Upon this he said: The horses are of three types. To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field. And whatever thing do these eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as would also the amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?, Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: No owner of the treasure who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but (his hoards) would be heated in the Fire of Hell and these would be made into plates and with these his sides, his forehead would be cauterised till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day, the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path, leading either to Paradise or to Hell. And no owner of the camels who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him and they (the camels) would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path leading him to Paradise or leading him to Hell. And no owner of the (cattle and) goats who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him, he would find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or with broken horns, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs and they would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants, during a day the extent of which would be fdty thousand years, and he would see the paths leading to Paradise or to Hell. Suhail said: I do not know whether he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), what about the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As regards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden. They said: Messenger of Allah, what about asses? He said: Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to it except this one comprehensive verse:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7).</span></p>

And there would be more (among this flock of sheep and goat) without horns or with broken horns. And no owner of the treasure who does not pay its due but his treasure would come on the Day of Resurrection like a bald snake and would pursue him with its mouth open, and when it would come near he would run away from it, and he would be called thus:&#8221; Take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it.&#8221; When he would find no way out he would put his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a he-camel.

My friend Abu&#8217;l-Qasim (Muhammad) (may peace he upon him) called me and I responded to him, and he said: Do you see Uhud? I saw the sun (shining) on me and I thought that he would send me on an errand for him. So I said: I see it. Upon this he said: Nothing would delight me more than this that I should have gold like it (equal to the bulk of Uhud), and I should spend it all except three dinars. (How sad it is) that they hoard worldly riches, and they know nothing. I said: What about you and your brothers Quraish? You do not go to thein for any need and do not accept anything from them. He said: By Allah, I neither beg anything from them (from worldly goods), nor do I ask them anything about religion till I meet my Allah and His Messenger.</span></p>

Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an): &#8216;&#8221; 0 people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being&#8221; to the end of the verse,&#8221; Allah is ever a Watcher over you&#8221; (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:&#8221; Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah&#8221; (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa&#8217; of wheat, some a sa&#8217; of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.</span></p>

And there came another man with more than this. The hypocrites said: Verily Allah does not stand in need of the charity of this, and the second one has done nothing but only made a show (of his charity). Then this verse was revealed.&#8221; Those who scoff at the voluntary givers of charity among the believers as well as those who cannot find anything (to give) but with their hard labour&#8221; (ix. 80). And Bishr did not utter the word Muttawwi&#8217;in.</span></p>

He again said: Qabisa, begging is not permissible but for one of the three (classes) of persons: one who has incurred debt, for him begging is permissible till he pays that off, after which he must stop it; a man whose property has been destroyed by a calamity which has smitten him, for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support life, or will provide him reasonable subsistence; and a person who has been smitten by poverty. the genuineness of which is confirmed by three intelligent members of this peoples for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support him, or will provide him subsistence. Qabisa, besides these three (every other reason) for begging is forbidden, and one who engages in such consumes that what is forbidden.</span></p>

Upon this I said: Messenger of Allah, I swear by God, the others besides them were more deserving than these (to whom you gave charity).

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, left a person and he did not give him any. thing. and he seemed to me the most excellent among them (and thus deserved the gifts more than anyone else).

He (the Messenger of Allah) said: He may be a Muslim.

Upon this a person said: By Allah, neither justice has been done In this distribution (of spoils), nor has the pleasure of Allah been sought in it. I (the Narrator ) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about it. so I came to him and informed him about what he had said. &#8211; The colour of his (the Prophet&#8217;s) face changed red like blood and he then said: Who would do justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice? He further said: May Allah have mercy upon Moses; he was tormented more than this, but he showed patience. I said: Never would I convey him (the Holy Prophet) after this (unpleasant) narration.</span></p>

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have done it with a view to con- cillating them. Then there came a person with thick beard, prominent cheeks, deep sunken eyes and protruding forehead and shaven head. He said: Muhammad, fear Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If I disobey Allah, who would then obey Him? Have I not been (sent as the) most trustworthy among the people of the-world? -but you do not repose trust in me. That person then went back. A person among the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to some, it was Khalid b. Walid who sought the permission. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), said: From this very person&#8217;s posterity there would arise people who would recite the Qur&#8217;an, but it would not go beyond their throat; they would kill the followers of Islam and would spare the idol-worshippers.

Abu Talib sent to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from Yemen some gold alloyed with clay in a leather bag dyed in the leaves of Mimosa flava. He distributed it among four men. &#8216;Uyaina b. Hisna, Aqra&#8217; b. Habis and Zaid al-Khail, and the fourth one was either Alqama b. &#8216;Ulatha or &#8216;Amir b. Tufail. A person from among his (Prophet&#8217;s) Companions said: We had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons). This (remark) reached the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) upon which he said: Will you not trust me, whereas I am a trustee of Him Who is in the heaven? The news come to me from the heaven morning and evening. Then there stood up a person with deep snnken eyes, prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, thick beard, shaven head, tucked up loin cloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe to thee. do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth? That man then returned. Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the prayer. Khalid said: How many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was going back. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of this (man) who would recite the Qur&#8217;an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats; they would (hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow passes through the prey.

Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khwarij. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur&#8217;an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an thinking that it sup- ports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Apostle (may peace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. &#8216;Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khwarij when we encountered them. He (&#8216;Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by Hadrat &#8216;Ali) on that day. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then (&#8216;Ali&#8217;s companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He (Hadrat &#8216;Ali) then pronounced Allah-O-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) conveyed it. Then there stood before him &#8216;Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath.</span></p>

Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) they said,&#8221; There is no command but that of Allah.&#8221; Upon this &#8216;Ali said: The statement is true but it is intentionally applied (to support) a wrong (cause). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him described their characteristics and I found these characteristics in them. They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah us one black man among them (Khwarij). One of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) killed them, he said: Search (for his dead body). They searched for him, but they did not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spoken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. &#8216;Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Ubaidullah said: And, I was present at (that place) when this happened and when &#8216;Ali said about them. A person narrated to me from Ibn Hanain that he said: I saw that black man.</span></p>

As they were talking about it there came &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib and stood before them, and they made a mention of it to him. &#8216;Ali b.

They set out and &#8216;Ali lay on the bed. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) offered the noon prayer. we went ahead of him to his apartment and stood near it till he came out. He took hold of our ears (out of love and affection) and then said: Give out what you have kept in your hearts. He then entered (the apartment) and we also went in and he (the Holy Prophet) was on that day (in the house of) Zainab b. jahsh. We urged each (of us) to speak. Then one of us thus spoke: Messenger of Allah, you are the best of humanity and the best to cement the ties of blood-relations. We have reached the-marriageable age. We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat. and we would pay you just as thin people (other collectors) pay you, and get our share as others get it. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silence for a long time till we wished that we should speak with him (again), and Zainab pointied to us from behind the curtain not to talk (any more). He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of Muhammad (to accept) sadaqat for they are the impurities of people. You call to me Mahmiya (and he was in charge of khums, i. e, of the one-fifth part that goes to the treasury out of the spoils of war), and Naufal b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib. They both came to him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said to Mahmiya: Marry your daughter to this young man (i. e. Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas), and he married her to him And he said to Naufal b.

He (the Jew) said. What would be their food alter this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: A bullockwhich was fed in the different quarters of Paradise would be slaughtered for them. He (the Jew) said: What would be their drink? He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would be given drink from the fountain which is named&#8221; Salsabil&#8221;. He (the Jew) said: I have come to ask you about a thing which no one amongst the people on the earth knows except an apostle or one or two men besides him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Would it benefit you if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I would lend ears to that. He then said: I have come to ask you about the child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The reproductive substance of man is white and that of woman (i. e. ovum central portion) yellow, and when they have sexual intercourse and the male&#8217;s substance (chromosomes and genes) prevails upon the female&#8217;s substance (chromosomes and genes), it is the male child that is created by Allah&#8217;s Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you are an Apostle. He then returned and went away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He asked me about such and such things of which I have had no knowledge till Allah gave me that.</p>

Abbas said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Place your lower garment on your shoulder (so that you may protect yourself from the roughness and hardness of stones). He (the Holy Prophet) did this, but fell down upon the ground in a state of unconciousness and his eyes were turned towards the sky. He then stood up and said: My lower garment, my lower garment; and this wrapper was tied around him. In the hadith transmitted by Ibn Rafi&#8217;, there is the word:&#8221; On his neck&#8221; and he did not say:&#8221; Upon his shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Purification (Kitab Al-Taharah) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have read in the first Book that the love of Allah is the highest aim of a true believer. It is for the achievement of this single end that he affirms his faith in Him by renouncing all other types of godhood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love of God is not something inert or lifeless; it is dynamic in the sense that it calls for a complete change in the life of man: change in his thoughts and ideas and change in his conduct and behaviour. One who claims to be a believer in Allah has to make a good deal of effort with a view to pleasing his: lord. He has to purify his soul from all evil thoughts and fancies so that the love of God should reside in it. Unless the soul is purged of all impurities one cannot achieve salvation. This is known as Tahdrah in Islam, and it is the foundation-stone of Imin. This high objective of the purification of the soul requires intentional and deliberate efforts and a good deal of sacrifice on the part of man, and the most elementary stage in this sacred path is the cleanliness of body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By enjoining cleanliness of body upon man Islam awakens him to the realisation of the fact that when impurities on the body of a man produce such unhealtby effects on his physical being and corrode his mental health, how miserable his life would be when his soul is polluted with impurities. The process of the purification of the soul should, therefore, start with the purification of the body.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Malik at-Ash&#8217;ari reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Cleanliness is half of faith and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fills the scale, and Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah) and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fill upwhat is between the heavens and the earth, and prayer is a light, and charity is proof (of one&#8217;s faith) and endurance is a brightness and the Holy Qur&#8217;an is a proof on your behalf or against you. All men go out early in the morning and sell themselves, thereby setting themselves free or destroying themselves.</p>

He said Ibn &#8216;Umar, why don&#8217;t you prayto Allah for me? He said: I heard of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: Neither the prayer is accepted without parification nor is charity accepted out of the ill-gotten (wealth), and thou wert the (governor) of Basra.</p>

I took hold of it and I went out with him. (I stopped but) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded on till he was out of my sight. He relieved himself and then came back and he was wearing a tight-sleeved Syrian gown. He tried to get his forearms out. but the sleeve of the gown was very narrow, so he brought his hands out from under the gown. I poured water over (his hands) and he performed ablution for prayer, then wiped over his socks and prayed.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 92:</p>
<h3 align="center">Holding Fast to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.092.373"></a>Volume 9, Book 92, Number 373:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 374:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard &#8216;Umar speaking while standing on the pulpit of the Prophet in the morning (following the death of the Prophet), when the people had sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr. He said the Tashah-hud before Abu Bakr, and said, &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du (then after) Allah has chosen for his Apostle what is with Him (Paradise) rather than what is with you (the world). This is that Book (Quran) with which Allah guided your Apostle, so stick to it, for then you will be guided on the right path as Allah guided His Apostle with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 375:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet embraced me and said, &#8220;O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book (Quran).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abal Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Barza said, &#8220;(O people!) Allah makes you self-sufficient or has raised you high with Islam and with Muhammad</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Bin &#8216;Umar wrote to &#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan, swearing allegiance to him: &#8216;I swear allegiance to you in that I will listen and obey what is in accordance with the Laws of Allah and the Tradition of His Apostle as much as I can.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Al-Musaiyab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have been sent with &#8216;Jawami-al-Kalim &#8216; (the shortest expression with the widest meaning) and have been made victorious with awe (cast in my enemy&#8217;s hearts), and while I was sleeping, I saw that the keys of the treasures of the world were placed in my hand.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle has gone, and you people are utilizing those treasures, or digging those treasures out.&#8221; or said a similar sentence.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 379:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There was no prophet among the prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I was given was the Divine Inspiration which Allah revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other prophet on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Shaiba in this Mosque (Al-Masjid-Al-Haram), and he said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar once sat beside me here as you are now sitting, and said, &#8216;I feel like distributing all the gold and silver that are in it (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba) among the Muslims&#8217;. I said, &#8216;You cannot do that.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Your two (previous) companions (the Prophet and Abu Bakr) did not do it. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;They are the two persons whom one must follow.'&#8221; (See Hadith No. 664, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;Honesty descended from the Heavens and settled in the roots of the hearts of men (faithful believers), and then the Quran was revealed and the people read the Quran, (and learnt it from it) and also learnt it from the Sunna.&#8221; Both Quran and Sunna strengthened their (the faithful believers&#8217;) honesty. (See Hadith No. 208)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best talk (speech) is Allah&#8217;s Book &#8216;Quran), and the best way is the way of Muhammad, and the worst matters are the heresies (those new things which are introduced into the religion); and whatever you have been promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape (it).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet when he said (to two men), &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;All my followers will enter Paradise except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who will refuse?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;There is an example for this companion of yours.&#8221; One of them said, &#8220;Then set forth an example for him.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;His example is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet.&#8221; Then the angels said, &#8220;Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; And then they said, &#8220;The houses stands for Paradise and the call maker is Muhammad; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8220;O the Group of Al-Qurra! Follow the straight path, for then you have taken a great lead (and will be the leaders), but if you divert right or left, then you will go astray far away.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, &#8216;O people! I have seen the enemy&#8217;s army with my own eyes, and I am the naked warner; so protect yourselves!&#8217; Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at night proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the Quran and the Sunna), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr was elected as a Caliph after him, some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How dare you fight the people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, I have been ordered to fight the people till they say &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; And whoever says: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; waves his wealth and his life from me unless he deserves a legal punishment lusty, and his account will be with Allah! Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, I will fight him who discriminates between Zakat and prayers, for Zakat is the Compulsory right to be taken from the wealth By Allah, if they refuse to give me even a tying rope which they use to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah, It was nothing, except I saw that Allah had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to the fight, and I came to know for certain that was the truth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa bin Badr came and stayed (at Medina) with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn who has one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Quran by heart) were the people of Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?&#8221; His nephew said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for &#8216;Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers!&#8221; Allah said to His Apostle &#8216;Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).&#8217; (7.199) and this person is among the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him, and &#8216;Umar said to observe (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to &#8216;Aisha during the solar eclipse. The people were standing (offering prayer) and she too, was standing and offering prayer. I asked, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; She pointed towards the sky with her hand and said, Subhan Allah!&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Is there a sign?&#8221; She nodded with her head meaning, yes. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished (the prayer), he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;There is not anything that I have not seen before but I have seen now at this place of mine, even Paradise and Hell. It has been revealed to me that you people will be put to trial nearly like the trial of Ad-Dajjal, in your graves. As for the true believer or a Muslim (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which of the two (words Asma&#8217; had said) he will say, &#8216;Muhammad came with clear signs from Allah, and we responded to him (accepted his teachings) and believed (what he said)&#8217; It will be said (to him) &#8216;Sleep in peace; we have known that you were a true believer who believed with certainty.&#8217; As for a hypocrite or a doubtful person, (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which word Asma&#8217; said) he will say, &#8216;I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said the same.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave me as I leave you) for the people who were before you were ruined because of their questions and their differences over their prophets. So, if I forbid you to do something, then keep away from it. And if I order you to do something, then do of it as much as you can.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most sinful person among the Muslims is the one who asked about something which had not been prohibited, but was prohibited because of his asking.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet took a room made of date palm leaves mats in the mosque. Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed in it for a few nights till the people gathered (to pray the night prayer (Tarawih) (behind him.) Then on the 4th night the people did not hear his voice and they thought he had slept, so some of them started humming in order that he might come out. The Prophet then said, &#8220;You continued doing what I saw you doing till I was afraid that this (Tarawih prayer) might be enjoined on you, and if it were enjoined on you, you would not continue performing it. Therefore, O people! Perform your prayers at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsory congregational) prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 229,Vol. 3) (See Hadith No. 134, Vol. 8)</p>
<hr>

Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then another man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

After finishing it with Taslim, he stood on the pulpit and mentioned the Hour and mentioned there would happen great events before it. Then he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to ask me any question, may do so, for by Allah, you will not ask me about anything but I will inform you of its answer as long as I am at this place of mine.&#8221; On this, the Ansar wept violently, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on saying, &#8220;Ask Me! &#8221; Then a man got up and asked, &#8221;Where will my entrance be, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;(You will go to) the Fire.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Hudhaifa got up and asked, &#8220;Who is my father, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; The Prophet then kept on saying (angrily), &#8220;Ask me! Ask me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar then knelt on his knees and said, &#8220;We have accepted Allah as our Lord and Islam as our religion and Muhammad as an Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle became quiet when &#8216;Umar said that. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, Paradise and Hell were displayed before me across this wall while I was praying, and I never saw such good and evil as I have seen today.&#8221;</p>

Inform us bout the spirit.&#8221; The Prophet stood up for a while, waiting. I realized that he was being Divinely Inspired, so I kept away from him till the inspiration was over. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;(O Muhammad) they ask you regarding the spirit, Say: The spirit its knowledge is with my Lord (i.e., nobody has its knowledge except Allah)&#8221; (17.85) (This is a miracle of the Qur&#8217;an that all the scientists up till now do not know about the spirit, i.e, how life comes to a body and how it goes away at its death) (See Hadith No. 245, Vol. 6)</p>

Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;You intended only to oppose me.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet whereupon there was revealed: &#8216;O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.&#8217; (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8216;Thence forward when &#8216;Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even fail to make the Prophet hear him, in which case the Prophet would ask him (to repeat his words).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi and said, &#8220;If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. &#8216;Asim returned and informed &#8216;Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Allah had already revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses (in that respect), after &#8216;Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;Allah has revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses regarding you and your wife.&#8221; The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li&#8217;an. The Prophet said (to the people). &#8220;Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he (&#8216;Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.&#8221; &#8216;Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I proceeded till I entered upon &#8216;Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &#8221; &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d ask your permission to come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &#8220;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them to enter. Al-&#8216;Abbas said &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Uthman and his companions said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,&#8217; and by this Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself?&#8221; On that the group said, &#8220;He verily said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said so?&#8221; They both replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah&#8217;s Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: &#8216;What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition&#8230; &#8216; (59.6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that property was totally meant for Allah&#8217;s Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah&#8217;s wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; Both of them replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; and took over all the Prophet&#8217;s property and disposed of it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and you were present then.&#8221; Then he turned to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, &#8216;I said: I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O &#8216;Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew&#8217;s property; and this (&#8216;Ali) came to me asking for his wives share from her father&#8217;s property, and I said to you both, &#8216;If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you both said, &#8216;Give it to us on that (condition).&#8217; So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?&#8221; The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, didn&#8217;t I give you all that property on that condition?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf.&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</p>

I was a poor man, and used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach, and the Muhajirin (emigrants) used to be busy trading in the markets, and the Ansar used to be busy looking after their properties. One-day I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Who will spread his Rida&#8217; (a garment covering the upper part of the body) till I finished my speech and then fold it, (i.e. wrap it over your body), in which case he will never forget anything he had heard from me.&#8221; So I spread my garment which I was wearing; and by Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, ever since, I have never forgotten whatever I heard from him (the Prophet)&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 119, Vol. 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allah&#8217;s Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, &#8220;Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.&#8221; (99.7-8)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet (Hadith 456).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet about the periods: How to take a bath after the periods. He said, &#8220;Take a perfumed piece of cloth and clean yourself with it.&#8221; She said,&#8217; &#8220;How shall I clean myself with it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself&#8221; She said again, &#8220;How shall I clean myself, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself with it.&#8221; Then I knew what Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant. So I pulled her aside and explained it to her.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um Hufaid bint Al-Harith bin Hazn presented the Prophet with some butter, dried yoghurt (curd milk) and mastigures as a gift. The Prophet then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has eaten garlic or onion, should keep away from us, or should keep away from our mosque and should stay at home.&#8221; Ibn Wahb said, &#8220;Once a plate full of cooked vegetables was brought to the Prophet at Badr. Detecting a bad smell from it, he asked about the dish and was informed of the kinds of vegetables in contained. He then said, &#8220;Bring it near,&#8221; and so it was brought near to one of his companions who was with him. When the Prophet saw it, he disliked eating it and said (to his companion), &#8220;Eat, for I talk in secret to ones whom you do not talk to.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 459:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lady came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she talked to him about something, and he gave her some order. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should not find you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you should not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.&#8221; Ibrahim bin Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;As if she meant the death (of the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 460:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and then explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to the Muslims). &#8220;Do not believe the people of the Book, nor disbelieve them, but say, &#8216;We believe in Allah and whatever is revealed to us, and whatever is revealed to you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 461:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Quran) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, &#8216;It is from Allah,&#8217; to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed. He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), &#8220;Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.&#8221; The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of &#8216;Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he said, &#8220;What do you suggest me regarding those people who are abusing my wife? I have never known anything bad about her.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said: When &#8216;Aisha was told of the slander, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will you allow me to go to my parents&#8217; home?&#8221; He allowed her and sent a slave along with her. An Ansari man said, &#8220;Subhanaka! It is not right for us to speak about this. Subhanaka! This is a great lie!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah in a gathering saying, &#8220;We, the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, &#8220;Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, &#8220;When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to &#8216;Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?&#8217; (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said, &#8216;You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.&#8217; So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah Al Muzam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform (an optional) prayer before Maghrib prayer.&#8221; (He repeated it thrice) and the third time he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to offer it can do so,&#8221; lest the people should take it as a Sunna (tradition). (See Hadith No. 277, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 466:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Quran as long as you are in agreement as to its interpretation and meanings, but when you have differences regarding its interpretation and meanings, then you should stop reciting it (for the time being.) (See Hadith No 581, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as your hearts are in agreement as to its meanings, but if you have differences as regards its meaning, stop reading it then.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Quran, so Allah&#8217;s Book is sufficient for us.&#8221; The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, &#8220;Come near so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while some of them said what &#8216;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &#8220;Go away and leave me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&#8217;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a very kind man  and when he realized our longing for our families, he asked us about those whom we had  left behind. When we informed him, he said, &#8220;Go back to your families and stay with  them and teach them (religion) and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet mentioned  things some of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, &#8220;Pray as you have  seen me praying, and when it is the time of prayer, one of you should pronounce the call  (Adhan) for the prayer and the eldest of you should lead the prayer. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen, he said to him,  &#8220;You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing  to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that  Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if  they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is  to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that,  then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh! Do you know what Allah&#8217;s  Right upon His slaves is?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;To worship Him (Allah) Alone and to join none in worship with Him  (Allah). Do you know what their right upon Him is?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know best.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Not to punish them (if they do so).&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): &#8216;Say (O  Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it  was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that  the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man  who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the  Sura 112): &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; &#8216; (112.1) When they  returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them),  &#8220;Ask him why he does so.&#8221; They asked him and he said, &#8220;I do so because it  mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&#8221; The  Prophet; said (to them), &#8220;Tell him that Allah loves him&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 474: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama bin Zaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet when suddenly there came to him a  messenger from one of his daughters who was asking him to come and see her son who was  dying. The Prophet said (to the messenger), &#8220;Go back and tell her that whatever Allah  takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, and everything with Him has a limited fixed  term (in this world). So order her to be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; But  she sent the messenger to the Prophet again, swearing that he should come to her. So the  Prophets got up, and so did Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada and Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal (and went to her). When  the child was brought to the Prophet his breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were  in a water skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon  Sa&#8217;d said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;This is mercy which Allah has put in the heart of His slaves, and Allah bestows His  mercy only on those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 373,  Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The keys of the unseen are five and  none knows them but Allah: (1) None knows what is in the womb, but Allah: (2) None knows  what will happen tomorrow, but Allah; (3) None knows when it will rain, but Allah; (4)  None knows where he will die, but Allah (knows that); (5) and none knows when the Hour  will be established, but Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

Qad! (enough! enough!)

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to invoke Allah at night, saying, &#8220;O  Allah: All the Praises are for You: You are the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth.

I surrender myself to You, and I believe in You and I depend upon You, and I repent  to You and with You (Your evidences) I stand against my opponents, and to you I leave the  judgment (for those who refuse my message). O Allah! Forgive me my sins that I did in the  past or will do in the future, and also the sins I did in secret or in public.

You are not calling a deaf or an absent person,  but you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near.&#8221; Then he came to me while  I was saying in my heart, &#8220;La hawla wala quwwatta illa billah (There is neither might  nor power but with Allah).&#8221; He said, to me, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Say, &#8216;La  hawla wala quwwata illa billah (There is neither might nor power but with Allah), for it  is one of the treasures of Paradise.&#8221; Or said, &#8220;Shall I tell you of it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As-Salami: Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to teach his companions to  perform the prayer of Istikhara for each and every matter just as he used to teach them  the Suras from the Quran He used to say, &#8220;If anyone of you intends to do some thing,  he should offer a two rakat prayer other than the compulsory prayers, and after finishing  it, he should say: O Allah! I consult You, for You have all knowledge, and appeal to You  to support me with Your Power and ask for Your Bounty, for You are able to do things while  I am not, and You know while I do not; and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah If  You know It this matter (name your matter) is good for me both at present and in the  future, (or in my religion), in my this life and in the Hereafter, then fulfill it for me  and make it easy for me, and then bestow Your Blessings on me in that matter. O Allah! If  You know that this matter is not good for me in my religion, in my this life and in my  coming Hereafter (or at present or in the future), then divert me from it and choose for  me what is good wherever it may be, and make me be pleased with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No.  391, Vol. 8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah will gather the believers on  the Day of Resurrection in the same way (as they are gathered in this life), and they will  say, &#8216;Let us ask someone to intercede for us with our Lord that He may relieve us from  this place of ours.&#8217; Then they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;O Adam! Don&#8217;t you see the people  (people&#8217;s condition)? Allah created you with His Own Hands and ordered His angels to  prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all the things. Please intercede for us  with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not  fit for this undertaking&#8217; and mention to them the mistakes he had committed, and add,  &#8220;But you d better go to Noah as he was the first Apostle sent by Allah to the people  of the Earth.&#8217; They will go to Noah who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking,&#8217;  and mention the mistake which he made, and add, &#8216;But you&#8217;d better go to Abraham, Khalil  Ar-Rahman.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will go to Abraham who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for  this undertaking,&#8217; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &#8216;But you&#8217;d better go  to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and to whom He spoke directly&#8217; They will go to  Moses who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking,&#8217; and mention to them the  mistakes he made, and add, &#8216;You&#8217;d better go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle and  His Word (Be: And it was) and a soul created by Him.&#8217; They will go to Jesus who will say,  &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad whose sins of the past  and the future had been forgiven (by Allah).&#8217; So they will come to me and I will ask the  permission of my Lord, and I will be permitted (to present myself) before Him. When I see  my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in  prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise your  head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your  request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will then raise my  head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will  intercede.

Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain  kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise, I will return  again, and when I see my Lord, I will fall down (in prostration) and He will leave me (in  prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise your head and  speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and  intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will then praise my Lord with  certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to  intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into  Paradise. I will come back and say, &#8216;O my Lord! None remains in Hell (Fire) but those whom  Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned therein and for whom eternity in Hell (Fire) has become inevitable.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;There will come out of Hell (Fire)  everyone who says: &#8216;La ilaha illal-lah,&#8217; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of  a barley grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &#8216; La ilaha  illal-lah,&#8217; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain.

Should we not inform the people of that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;There are  one-hundred degrees in Paradise which Allah has prepared for those who carry on Jihad in  His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and  the Earth, so if you ask Allah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaus, for it is the last  part of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise, and at its top there is the Throne of  Beneficent, and from it gush forth the rivers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I entered the mosque while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting  there. When the sun had set, the Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Dharr! Do you know where this  (sun) goes?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It  goes and asks permission to prostrate, and it is allowed, and (one day) it, as if being  ordered to return whence it came, then it will rise from the west.&#8221; Then the Prophet  recited, &#8220;That: &#8220;And the sun runs on its fixed course (for a term  decreed),&#8221; (36.38) as it is recited by &#8216;Abdullah. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Ali was in Yemen, he sent some gold in its ore to the  Prophet. The Prophet distributed it among Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habis Al-Hanzali who belonged to  Bani Mujashi, &#8216;Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, &#8216;Alqama bin &#8216;Ulatha Al-&#8216;Amiri, who belonged to  the Bani Kilab tribe and Zaid AI-Khail At-Ta&#8217;i who belonged to Bani Nabhan. So the Quraish  and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He gives to the chiefs of Najd and leaves  us!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I just wanted to attract and unite their hearts (make  them firm in Islam).&#8221; Then there came a man with sunken eyes, bulging forehead, thick  beard, fat raised cheeks, and clean-shaven head, and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Be afraid of  Allah! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Allah). He  trusts me over the people of the earth, but you do not trust me?&#8221; A man from the  people (present then), who, I think, was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill  him, but the Prophet prevented him. When the man went away, the Prophet said, &#8220;Out of  the offspring of this man, there will be people who will recite the Quran but it will not  go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the  game, and they will kill the Muslims and leave the idolators. Should I live till they  appear, I would kill them as the Killing of the nation of &#8216;Ad.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out to us on the night of the full  moon and said, &#8220;You will see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection as you see this  (full moon) and you will have no difficulty in seeing Him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 532c: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yazid Al-Laithi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the  sun when there are no clouds?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of  Resurrection, and say, &#8216;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that  thing),&#8217; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the  moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he  will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or  its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say,  &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will (deny Him and) say, &#8216;We will stay here till our Lord comes,  for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&#8217; So Allah will come to them in His  appearance which they know, and will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;You are our  Lord,&#8217; so they will follow Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&#8217; I and my  followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except  the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &#8216;O Allah, save!  Save!&#8217; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan  (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&#8217;dan? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan, but none  knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to  their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil)  deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be  punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He  will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to  take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom  Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the  right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks  of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except  the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of  prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of  life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the  mud of the torrent. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and  there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the  people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from  the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&#8217; So he will invoke  Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &#8216;If I  grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will reply, &#8216;No, by Your Power,  (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&#8217; He will give his Lord whatever promises and  covenants Allah will demand. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he  will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish  him to remain quiet, then he will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&#8217;  Allah will say to him, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never  ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How  treacherous you are!&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my lord,&#8217; and will keep on invoking Allah till He  says to him, &#8216;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will  reply, &#8216;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then  Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise,  Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures  whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he  will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your  covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been  given?&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How treacherous you are! &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The man will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most  miserable of Your creation,&#8217; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh  because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him,  &#8216;Enter Paradise,&#8217; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &#8216;Wish for anything.&#8217;  So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself  will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &#8216;(Wish for) so-and-so.&#8217; When there  is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &#8216;This is for you, and its equal (is for you)  as well.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yazid added: Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri who was present  with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that  Allah had said, &#8220;That is for you and its equal as well,&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri  said, &#8220;And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I do not  remember, except his saying, &#8216;That is for you and its equal as well.'&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id  Al-Khudri then said, &#8220;I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, &#8216;That is for you,  and ten times as much.&#8217; &#8216; Abu Huraira then added, &#8220;That man will be the last person  of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on  the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun  and the moon when the sky is clear?&#8221; We said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you  will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in  seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Somebody  will then announce, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&#8217; So the companions  of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and  the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain  those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some  of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a  mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &#8220;What did you use to worship?&#8217; They will  reply, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are  liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&#8217; They will reply,  &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; Then it will be said to them &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they  will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &#8216;What did you  use to worship?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Messiah, the son of  Allah.&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do  you want (now)?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; It will be said to  them, &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who  used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be  said to them, &#8216;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We  parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we  heard the call of one proclaiming, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#8217;  and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#8217; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other  than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#8216;I am your Lord,&#8217; and they  will say, &#8216;You are not our Lord.&#8217; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and  then it will be said to them, &#8216;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#8217; They  will say. &#8216;The Shin,&#8217; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer  will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him  just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate  but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to  prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&#8221; We, the companions of the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8220;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are  clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and  has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&#8217;dan.  Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others  as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe  without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall  down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the  bridge).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming  from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding  with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will say, &#8216;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they)  used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Go  and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one  (gold) Dinar.&#8217; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go  to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle  of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will  return, and Allah will say (to them), &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you  find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&#8217; They will take out whomever they will  recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose  heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will  take out all those whom they will recognize.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: If you do not believe  me then read the Holy Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or  a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&#8217; (4.40) The Prophet added,  &#8220;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the  Almighty (Allah) will say, &#8216;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of  the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they  will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the  torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the  side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those  people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden)  necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say,  &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise  without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for  themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its  equivalent as well.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are Adam, the  father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His  Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all  things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place  of ours? Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will mention his mistakes  he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He  will add, &#8216;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&#8217; The  people will go to Noah who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking&#8217; He will mention  his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&#8217; He will say  (to them), &#8216;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&#8217; They will go to Abraham who will say, &#8216;I am  not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say  (to them). &#8216;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and  brought near Him, for conversation.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will go to Moses who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to  them), &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His  Word.&#8217; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been  forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&#8217;s permission to enter  His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration  before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will  say, &#8216;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede,  for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&#8217;  Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me.  Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them  out and make them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the  Prophet said, &#8220;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter  Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I  will be permitted. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before  Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and  then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and  intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&#8217;  &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He  has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a  certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada  added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8216;I will go out and take them out of  Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask  my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him,  and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &#8216;Raise your head,  O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession  will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and  praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me  (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter  Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8220;So I will  go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain  in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for  eternal life in the fire).&#8221; The narrator then recited the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;It may be  that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&#8217; (17.79) The narrator  added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet. </font></p>

You are the Truth, and  Your saying is the Truth, and Your promise is the Truth, and the meeting with You is the  Truth, and Paradise is the Truth, and the (Hell) Fire is the Truth. O Allah! I surrender  myself to You, and believe in You, and I put my trust in You (solely depend upon). And to  You I complain of my opponents and with Your Evidence I argue. So please forgive the sins  which I have done in the past or I will do in the future, and also those (sins) which I  did in secret or in public, and that which You know better than I. None has the right to  be worshipped but You.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original  state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve  months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely,  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between  Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; The Prophet then asked us, &#8220;Which month is  this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8221; He kept quiet so  long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it  Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked &#8220;What town is this?&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8217; Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought he might call it by another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the (forbidden)  town (Mecca)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is the day today?&#8221;  We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better. Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the Day of  An-Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifices)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said,  &#8220;Your blood (lives), your properties,&#8221; (the sub narrator Muhammad, said: I think  he also said): &#8220;..and your honor) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of  this Day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your  deeds. Beware! Don&#8217;t go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is  incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the  informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present  audience.&#8221; Whenever the sub-narrator Muhammad mentioned that statement, he would say,  &#8220;The Prophet said the truth.&#8221;) And then the Prophet added, &#8220;No doubt!

Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up, and so did  Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b and &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle the true and truly inspired, narrated to  us, &#8220;The creation of everyone of you starts with the process of collecting the  material for his body within forty days and forty nights in the womb of his mother. Then  he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period (40 days) and then he becomes like a  piece of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is sent to him (by Allah) and the angel  is allowed (ordered) to write four things; his livelihood, his (date of) death, his deeds,  and whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one (in the Hereafter) and then the  soul is breathed into him. So one of you may do (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise so much that there is nothing except a cubit between him and Paradise but then  what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds  characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) and (ultimately) enters Hell (Fire); and one  of you may do (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) so much so that  there is nothing except a cubit between him and Hell (Fire), then what has been written  for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise and ultimately) enters Paradise.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That one night Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited him and Fatima, the  daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said to them, &#8220;Won &#8216;t you offer (night) prayer?..  &#8216;Ali added: I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our souls are in the Hand of Allah and when  He Wishes to bring us to life, He does.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle went away when I said  so and he did not give any reply. Then I heard him on leaving while he was striking his  thighs, saying, &#8216;But man is, more quarrelsome than anything.&#8217; (18.54) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The example of a believer is  that of a fresh green plant the leaves of which move in whatever direction the wind forces  them to move and when the wind becomes still, it stand straight. Such is the similitude of  the believer: He is disturbed by calamities (but is like the fresh plant he regains his  normal state soon). And the example of a disbeliever is that of a pine tree (which  remains) hard and straight till Allah cuts it down when He will.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 546  and 547, Vol. 7). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was standing on the  pulpit, saying, &#8220;The remaining period of your stay (on the earth) in comparison to  the nations before you, is like the period between the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. The people  of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were  worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel  were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then  they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were  given the Quran and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each  (double the reward of the previous nations).&#8221; Then the people of the Torah said, &#8216;O  our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a  greater reward.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Have I withheld anything from your reward?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217;  Then Allah said, &#8216;That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I, along with a group of people, gave the pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said, &#8220;I take your Pledge on the condition that you  (1) will not join partners in worship with Allah, (2) will not steal, (3) will not commit  illegal sexual intercourse, (4) will not kill your offspring, (5) will not slander, (6)  and will not disobey me when I order you to do good. Whoever among you will abide by his  pledge, his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commits any of those sins and receives  the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an expiation for his sins and  purification; but if Allah screens him, then it will be up to Allah to punish him if He  will or excuse Him, if He will.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Prophet  said, &#8220;If Solomon had said; &#8216;If Allah Will,&#8217; then each of those women would have  delivered a (would-be) cavalier to fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 74 A,  Vol. 4). </font></p>

I will not know whether he has  been one of those who have fallen unconscious and then regained consciousness before me,  or if he has been one of those exempted by Allah (from falling unconscious).&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 524, Vol. 8) </font></p>

Did you hear Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning anything about him?&#8221; Ubai said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8220;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites a man came to him  and asked, &#8216;Do you know Someone who is more learned than you (Moses)?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;No.&#8217;  So Allah sent the Divine inspiration to Moses:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you&#8217; Moses  asked Allah how to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it was  said to him, &#8216;When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you  will meet him.&#8217; So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The boy  servant of Moses (who was accompanying him) said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened)  when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget to tell you (about) the fish.  None but Satan made me forget to tell you about it&#8217; (18.63) Moses said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;That is what we have been seeking.&#8221; Sa they went back  retracing their footsteps. (18.64). So they both found Kadir (there) and then happened  what Allah mentioned about them (in the Quran)!&#8217; (See 18.60-82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Every night when it is the last  third of the night, our Lord, the Superior, the Blessed, descends to the nearest heaven  and says: Is there anyone to invoke Me that I may respond to his invocation?

All the Praises are for You; You are the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth  and whatever is therein.

It is You Whom I worship, None has the  right to be worshipped except You .&#8221; (See Hadith No. 329,Vol. 8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ma&#8217;bad bin Hilal Al&#8217;Anzi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas  bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about  the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival  coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he  was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, &#8220;Do not ask him about anything else first  but the Hadith of Intercession.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren  from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.&#8221; Anas then said,  &#8220;Muhammad talked to us saying, &#8216;On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with  each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, &#8216;Please intercede for us  with your Lord.&#8217; He will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that but you&#8217;d better go to Abraham as he  is the Khalil of the Beneficent.&#8217; They will go to Abraham and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit  for that, but you&#8217;d better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.&#8217; So  they will go to Moses and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that, but you&#8217;d better go to  Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.&#8217; (Be: And it was) they will go to  Jesus and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that, but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They would come to me and I would say, &#8216;I am for that.&#8217;  Then I will ask for my Lord&#8217;s permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire  me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those  praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise  your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your  request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my  followers! My followers!&#8217; And then it will be said, &#8216;Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all  those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.&#8217; I will go  and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before  Him. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be  listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your  intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&#8217; It will  be said, &#8216;Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the  weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.&#8217; I will go and do so and return to praise Him  with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, &#8216;O,  Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be  granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will  say, &#8216;O Lord, my followers!&#8217; Then He will say, &#8216;Go and take out (all those) in whose  hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the  Fire.&#8217; I will go and do so.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions,  &#8220;Let&#8217;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request  him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&#8221; So we went to him and we greeted him  and he admitted us. We said to him, &#8220;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother  Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I  have never heard.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Then we told him of the Hadith  and said, &#8220;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&#8221; He said, &#8220;What  then?&#8221; We said, &#8220;He did not add anything to that.&#8221; He said, Anas related  the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&#8217;t know whether he  forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&#8221; We said,  &#8220;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&#8221; He smiled and said, &#8220;Man was created  hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the  Prophet added, &#8216;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate  before Him me the same as he &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be  listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your  intercession will be accepted .&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&#8217; Then Allah will say, &#8216;By my  Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell  (Fire) whoever said: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

One of  them said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221; The middle (second) angel said, &#8220;He is  the best of them.&#8221; The last (third) angle said, &#8220;Take the best of them.&#8221;  Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another  night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258,  Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not&#8212;-and so is the case  with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did  not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From  among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his  throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and  abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the  inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom  was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then  closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on  one of its doors. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The dwellers of the Heaven asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said,  &#8220;Gabriel.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Has he been called?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;  They said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with  his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless  Allah informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the  Prophet, &#8220;He is your father; greet him.&#8221; The Prophet greeted him and Adam  returned his greeting and said, &#8220;Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!&#8221;  Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, &#8220;What  are these two rivers, O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;These are the sources of the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw  another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put  his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, &#8220;What is this,  O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for  you.&#8221; Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the  same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Gabriel replied,  &#8220;Gabriel&#8221;. They asked, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Has he been sent for?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; Then he (Gabriel) ascended with  the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first  and the second Heavens had said. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they  said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same;  and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended  with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets  whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on  the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don&#8217;t remember, on the fifth Heaven,  Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of  talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), &#8220;O Lord! I thought that none would  be raised up above me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance  above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond  which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached  and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said  that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263,  264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: &#8220;Fifty prayers  were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then  Moses stopped him and asked, &#8220;O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?&#8221;  The Prophet replied,&#8221; He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a  night.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord  may reduce it for you and for them.&#8221; So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted  to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, &#8220;Yes, if  you wish.&#8221; So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in  his place, &#8220;O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that.&#8221;  So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him  again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to  only five prayers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to  five and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to  do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are  weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten  your burden.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel  did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said,  &#8220;O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so  lighten our burden.&#8221; On that the Irresistible said, &#8220;O Muhammad!&#8221; the  Prophet replied, &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;The Word that comes  from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the  Book.&#8221; Allah added, &#8220;Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is  fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in  practice).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, &#8220;What have  you done?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good  deed a tenfold reward.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel  observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten  your burden further.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of  returning too many times to my Lord.&#8221; On that Gabriel said, &#8220;Descend in Allah&#8217;s  Name.&#8221; The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca). </font></p>

On that Allah will say (to him),  &#8220;Take, here you are, O son of Adam, for nothing satisfies you.&#8217; &#8220;On that the  bedouin said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Such man must be either from Quraish or from Ansar,  for they are farmers while we are not.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled . </font></p>

How can you ask the people of the Scriptures about anything while your Book which Allah  has revealed to your Prophet contains the most recent news from Allah and is pure and not  distorted? Allah has told you that the people of the Scriptures have changed some of  Allah&#8217;s Books and distorted it and wrote something with their own hands and said, &#8216;This is  from Allah, so as to have a minor gain for it. Won&#8217;t the knowledge that has come to you  stop you from asking them? No, by Allah, we have never seen a man from them asking you  about that (the Book Al-Qur&#8217;an ) which has been revealed to you. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;id bin Jubair reported from Ibn &#8216;Abbas (regarding the  explanation of the Verse: &#8216;Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste  therewith) . He said, &#8220;The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the  Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said (to Sa&#8217;id), &#8220;I move  them (my lips) as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move his lips.&#8221; And Said said (to me),  &#8220;I move my lips as I saw Ibn &#8216;Abbas moving his lips,&#8221; and then he moved his  lips. So Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the  Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the  ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).&#8217;  (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow  you its recital.&#8217; (75.18) This means, &#8220;You should listen to it and keep quiet and  then it is upon Us to make you recite it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The narrator added, &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to listen  whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur&#8217;an  as Gabriel had recited it to him.&#8221; </font></p>

Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&#8217; (17.110) This Verse was revealed  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hiding himself at Mecca. At that time, when he led his  companions in prayer, he used to raise his voice while reciting the Qur&#8217;an; and if the  pagans heard him, they would abuse the Qur&#8217;an, its Revealer, and the one who brought it.  So Allah said to His Prophet: &#8220;Neither say your prayer aloud. i.e., your recitation  (of Qur&#8217;an) lest the pagans should hear (it) and abuse the Quran&#8221; nor say it in a low  tone, &#8220;lest your voice should fail to reach your companions, &#8220;but follow a way  between.&#8221; (17.110) </font></p>

The people of the Torah were given  the Torah and they acted on it till midday and then they were unable to carry on. And they  were given (a reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given  the Gospel and they acted on it till &#8216;Asr Prayer and then they were unable to carry on, so  they were given la reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then you were given the Qur&#8217;an and you  acted on it till sunset, therefore you were given (a reward equal to) two Qirats each. On  that, the people of the Scriptures said, &#8216;These people (Muslims) did less work than we but  they took a bigger reward.&#8217; Allah said (to them). &#8216;Have I done any oppression to you as  regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Allah said, &#8216;That is My Blessing  which I grant to whomsoever I will.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

He recited it in a  vibrating and pleasant voice. Then Mu&#8217;awiya recited as &#8216;Abdullah bin Mughaffal had done  and said, &#8220;Were I not afraid that the people would crowd around me, I would surely  recite in a vibrating pleasant voice as Ibn Mughaffal did, imitating the Prophet.&#8221; I  asked Muawiya, &#8220;How did he recite in that tone?&#8221; He said thrice, &#8220;A, A ,  A.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet asked the Jews, &#8220;What do you  (usually) do with them?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We blacken their faces and disgrace  them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Bring here the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful.&#8221;  They (fetched it and) came and asked a one-eyed man to recite. He went on reciting till he  reached a portion on which he put his hand. The Prophet said, &#8220;Lift up your  hand!&#8221; He lifted his hand up and behold, there appeared the verse of Ar-Rajm (stoning  of the adulterers to death). Then he said, &#8220;O Muhammad! They should be stoned to  death but we conceal this Divine Law among ourselves.&#8221; Then the Prophet ordered that  the two sinners be stoned to death and, and they were stoned to death, and I saw the man  protecting the woman from the stones.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zahdam: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There were good relations and brotherhood between this  tribe of Jurm and the Ash&#8217;ariyyin. Once, while we were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari,  there was brought to him a meal which contained chicken meat, and there was sitting beside  him, a man from the tribe of Bani Taimul-lah who looked like one of the Mawali. Abu Musa  invited the man to eat but the man said, &#8220;I have seen chicken eating some dirty  things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said to him,  &#8220;Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet  with a few men from Ash&#8217;ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Allah, I  will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a  few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying,  &#8216;Where are the group of Ash&#8217;ariyyin?&#8217; So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us  and then we set out. We said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle took an oath that he  would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided  us with mounts. We made Allah&#8217;s Apostle forget his oath! By Allah, we will never be  successful.&#8217; So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, &#8216;I have not  provided you with the mount, but Allah has done so. By Allah, I may take an oath to do  something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and  make the expiation for my oath.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

So please order us to do something good  (Religious deeds) by which we may enter Paradise (by acting on them) and we may inform our  people whom we have left behind to observe it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you  to do four things and forbid you from four things: I order you to believe in Allah. Do you  know what is meant by belief in Allah? It is to testify that none has the right to be  worshipped except Allah, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus  (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Allah&#8217;s Cause). And I forbid you four things, (i.e., Do  not drink alcoholic drinks) Ad-Dubba, An-Naqir, (pitched water skins), Az-Zuruf,  Al-Muzaffat and Al&#8211;Hantam (names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic  drinks).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Interpretation of Dreams </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.087.111">Volume 9, Book 87, Number 111: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream  but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira  where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take  with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take  his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended  upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to  read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; (The Prophet added),  &#8220;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it  anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read,&#8221; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I  could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I  replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&#8221; Thereupon he  caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &#8220;Read: In  the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot.  Read and Your Lord is Most Generous&#8230;up to&#8230;.. ..that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.15) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his  neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &#8220;Cover me!  Cover me!&#8221; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &#8220;O Khadija,  what is wrong with me?&#8221; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &#8216;I  fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija said, &#8216;Never! But have the glad  tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your  Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest  generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; Khadija then  accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza bin Qusai.  Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&#8217;s brother, who during the  Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to  write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and  had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your  nephew.&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet  described whatever he had seen. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel,  the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and  could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked, &#8220;Will they turn me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said:  &#8220;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated  with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I  would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard  that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every  time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear  before him and say, &#8220;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&#8217;s Apostle in truth&#8221;  whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And  whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as  before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him  and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &#8216;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &#8216;He it  is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&#8217; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of  the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night). </font></p>

I asked, &#8216;Who is this man?&#8217; Somebody replied, &#8216;(He is) Messiah, son of Mary.&#8217;  Then I saw another man with very curly hair, blind in the right eye which looked like a  protruding out grape.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit Um Haram bint Milhan she was  the wife of &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit. One day the Prophet visited her and she provided him with  food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept and afterwards  woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Some of my followers were presented before me in my dream as fighters in  Allah&#8217;s Cause, sailing in the middle of the seas like kings on the thrones or like kings  sitting on their thrones.&#8221; (The narrator Ishaq is not sure as to which expression was  correct). Um Haram added, &#8216;I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah, to make me one  of them;&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and then laid his head down (and  slept). Then he woke up smiling (again). (Um Haram added): I said, &#8220;What makes you  smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Some people of my followers were presented  before me (in a dream) as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; He said the same as he had said  before. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Al-&#8216;Ala an Ansari woman who had given a pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me:, &#8220;The Muhajirln (emigrants) were distributed  amongst us by drawing lots, and we got &#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un in our share. We made him stay  with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which proved fatal. When he died and  was given a bath and was shrouded in his clothes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, I said,  (addressing the dead body), &#8216;O Aba As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be Merciful to you! I testify that  Allah has honored you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;How do you know that Allah has honored  him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! On whom  else shall Allah bestow. His honor?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As for him, by Allah, death  has come to him. By Allah, I wish him all good (from Allah). By Allah, in spite of the  fact that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do not know what Allah will do to me.&#8221;, Um Al-&#8216;Ala  added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; </font></p>

So, if someone has a dream which he  dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer.&#8221; He added,  &#8220;He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream)  and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet  symbolizes one&#8217;s constant and firm adherence to religion.&#8221; And Abu &#8216;Abdullah said,  &#8220;Ghuls (iron collars) are used only for necks.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Men from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to see  dreams during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man  and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, &#8220;If there were  any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.&#8221; So when I went to bed one  night, I said, &#8220;O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.&#8221; So  while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each  of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was  between them, invoking Allah, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.&#8221; Then  I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said  to me, &#8220;Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more  often.&#8221; So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was  built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post  there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down  with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels)  took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No doubt, &#8216;Abdullah is a good man.&#8221;  (Nafi&#8217; said, &#8220;Since then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to pray much.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young unmarried man during the lifetime of the  Prophet. I used to sleep in the mosque. Anyone who had a dream, would narrate it to the  Prophet. I said, &#8220;O Allah! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream  so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may interpret it for me.&#8221; So I slept and saw (in a dream) two  angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, you are a good man.&#8221; They took me towards the Fire, and  behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I  recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned  that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet and he said,  &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah is a righteous man if he only prays more at night.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said,  &#8220;After that, &#8216;Abdullah used to pray more at night.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping,  I saw that a cup full of milk was brought to me and I drank of it and gave the remaining  of it to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; They asked. What have you interpreted (about the  dream)? O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said. &#8220;(It is Religious)  knowledge.&#8221; </font></p>

I interpret it as a symbol of  two liars who will appear.&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;One of them was Al-&#8216;Ansi who was  killed by Fairuz at Yemen and the other was Musailama (at Najd) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I saw in a dream that I was  migrating from Mecca to a land where there were date palm trees. I thought that it might  be the land of Al-Yamama or Hajar, but behold, it turned out to be Yathrib (i.e. Medina).  And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah is better (than  worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)  on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good  and the reward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the  Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Allah in the Battle of Khaibar and  the conquest of Mecca) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I saw in a  dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honey were dropping from it and I saw the people  gathering it in their hands, some gathering much and some a little. And behold, there was  a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (the Prophet) held it and  went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) held it  and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got  connected again.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed  for you! Allow me to interpret this dream.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Interpret  it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;The cloud with shade symbolizes Islam, and the butter and  honey dropping from it, symbolizes the Quran, its sweetness dropping and some people  learning much of the Qur&#8217;an and some a little. The rope which is extended from the sky to  the earth is the Truth which you (the Prophet) are following. You follow it and Allah will  raise you high with it, and then another man will follow it and will rise up with it and  another person will follow it and then another man will follow it but it will break and  then it will be connected for him and he will rise up with it. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my  father be sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;You  are right in some of it and wrong in some.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  By Allah, you must tell me in what I was wrong.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not  swear.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura bin Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle very often used to ask his companions,  &#8220;Did anyone of you see a dream?&#8221; So dreams would be narrated to him by those  whom Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two persons came  to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; I set out with them and we  came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding  a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&#8217;s head, injuring it. The rock  rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man,  his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done  before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&#8217; They said,  &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man  standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of  the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly  tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the  other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly  completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to  it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are  these two persons?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something  like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&#8221; I  think the Prophet said, &#8220;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame  of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly.  I asked them, &#8216;Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; And so we proceeded and came  across a river.&#8221; I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;. red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man  who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him.  The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth  whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated,  I asked my two companions, &#8216;Who are these (two) persons?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed!  Proceed!&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most  repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was  kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &#8216;Who is this (man)?&#8217; They said  to me, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense  vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very  tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there  were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &#8216;Who  is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic  huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &#8216;Go  up and I went up&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;So we ascended till we reached a city built of  gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the  gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of  their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side  as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to  throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and  its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then  returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the  best shape.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;My two companions (angels) said to me,  &#8216;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and  behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &#8216;That  (palace) is your place.&#8217; I said to them, &#8216;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to  them, &#8216;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being  injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither  recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the  man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to  back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so  many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw  in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and  the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of  usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going  round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is  Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic  Faith).&#8221; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What about the children of pagans?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;And also the children  of pagans.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;My two companions added, &#8216;The men you saw half  handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another  that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from the tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to the Prophet and  embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet cut off the hands and feet of the men belonging  to the tribe of &#8216;Uraina and did not cauterise (their bleeding limbs) till they died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 796: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 797: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.082.798"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 798: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.082.799"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 799: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever guarantees me (the chastity  of) what is between his legs (i.e. his private parts), and what is between his jaws (i.e.,  his tongue), I guarantee him Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate  to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The Hour  sill not be established&#8221; or said: &#8220;From among the portents of the Hour is that  the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general  ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very  common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in  number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one  man to look after them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800e: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima from Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostles said, &#8220;When a slave (of Allah)  commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and  if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic  drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when  he commits a murder,&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said: I asked Ibn Abbas, &#8220;How is faith taken away  from him?&#8221; He said, Like this,&#8221; by clasping his hands and then separating them,  and added, &#8220;But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands  again. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 801: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who commits an illegal  sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse  and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic  drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open  thereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which is the biggest  sin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To set up rivals to Allah by worshipping others though He alone  has created you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your  child lest it should share your food.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a  charge of committing an illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet asked them. &#8220;What is  the legal punishment (for this sin) in your Book (Torah)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Our  priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and  Tajbiya.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, tell them to bring the  Torah.&#8221; The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine  Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed  it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that the two (sinners)  be stoned to death, and so they were stoned. Ibn &#8216;Umar added: So both of them were stoned  at the Balat and I saw the Jew sheltering the Jewess. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet in the mosque and said, &#8220;I  am burnt (ruined)!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;With what (what have you  done)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have had sexual relation with my wife in the month of  Ramadan (while fasting).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Give in charity.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; The man sat down, and in the meantime there came a  person driving a donkey carrying food to the Prophet &#8230;.. (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdur  Rahman added: I do not know what kind of food it was). On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Where is the burnt person?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; The Prophet  said to him, &#8220;Take this (food) and give it in charity (to someone).&#8221; The man  said, &#8220;To a poorer person than l? My family has nothing to eat.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said to him, &#8220;Then eat it yourselves.&#8221; </font></p>

I have committed an illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet turned his face  away from him. The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have committed an illegal intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet  turned his face to the other side, and the man came to that side, and when he confessed  four times, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes,  O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said (to the people), &#8220;Take him away and stone  him to death.&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;I was told by one who heard Jabir, that Jabir  said, &#8216;I was among those who stoned the man, and we stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying  Place), and when the stones troubled him, he jumped quickly and ran away, but we overtook  him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death (there).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Then I asked a learned  man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and  be exiled for one year, and the man&#8217;s wife should be stoned to death.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of  Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to  receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais! Go to the wife of this  man, and if she confesses, then stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to her and she  confessed. He then stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I am afraid that after a long time has  passed, people may say, &#8220;We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in  the Holy Book,&#8221; and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that  Allah has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who  commits illegal sexual intercourse, if he is already married and the crime is proved by  witnesses or pregnancy or confession.&#8221; Sufyan added, &#8220;I have memorized this  narration in this way.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Surely Allah&#8217;s Apostle carried out the  penalty of Rajam, and so did we after him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 817: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais!

One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before  and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Where he  lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &#8220;O Muhammad! He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

Abu Bakr said (to me), &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  the people, and there is no water in this place.&#8221; So he admonished me and struck my  flanks with his hand, and nothing could stop me from moving except the reclining of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (on my thigh), and then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to towards me and struck me violently with  his fist and said, &#8220;You have detained the people because of your necklace.&#8221; But  I remained motionless as if I was dead lest I should awake Allah&#8217;s Apostle although that  hit was very painful. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;If I found a man with my wife, I  would kill him with the sharp side of my sword.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that he said,  &#8220;Do you wonder at Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s sense of ghira (self-respect)? Verily, I have more sense of  ghira than Sa&#8217;d, and Allah has more sense of ghira than I.&#8221; </font></p>

I sleep and my Lord makes me eat and drink.&#8221; When the people refused to give  up Al-Wisal, the Prophet fasted along with them for one day, and did not break his fast  but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet said,  &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a  third day),&#8221; as if he wanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged  his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The  Prophet ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, &#8220;If I kept her, I would  be a liar.&#8221; I remember that Az-Zubair also said, &#8220;(It was said) that if that  woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove  truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red  insect), he would prove untruthful.&#8221; I heard Az-Zubair also saying, &#8220;Finally she  gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the couple who had taken the oath of  Lian. &#8216;Abdullah bin Shaddad said (to him), &#8220;Was this woman about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;If I were ever to stone to death any woman without witnesses. (I would have stoned  that woman to death)?&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas replied,&#8221; No, that lady exposed herself (by her  suspicious behavior).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Lian was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet, Asim bin  Adi said a statement about it, and when he left, a man from his tribe came to him  complaining that he had seen a man with his wife. Asim said, &#8220;I have been put to  trial only because of my statement.&#8221; So he took the man to the Prophet and the man  told him about the incident. The man (husband) was of yellow complexion, thin, and of lank  hair, while the man whom he had accused of having been with his wife, was reddish brown  with fat thick legs and fat body. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8221;  Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of  having been with her. So the Prophet made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn  Abbas in the gathering, &#8220;Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet said, &#8220;If  I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without  witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;No, that  was another lady who used to behave in such a suspicious way among the Muslims that one  might accuse her of committing illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

What are they?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to practice sorcery; to kill the life  which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law); to eat up  usury (Riba), to eat up the property of an orphan; to give one&#8217;s back to the enemy and  freeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and to accuse chaste women who never  even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I beseech you to  judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up  and said, &#8220;He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and please  allow me (to speak), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom  (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they  informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year,  and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).&#8221;The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The  one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife  of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death.&#8221; She confessed and  he stoned her to death. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Oaths and Vows</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.078.618"></a>Volume 8, Book 78, Number 618:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Allah revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, &#8220;If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 619:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven&#8217;t got anything to mount you on.&#8221; Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath).&#8221; When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, &#8220;I did not give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last in the world, but will be foremost on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also said, &#8220;By Allah, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allah&#8217;s sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed, and insists on keeping it, he surely commits a sin greater (than that of dissolving his oath). He should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army detachment and made Usama bin Zaid its commander. Some people criticized (spoke badly of) Usama&#8217;s leadership. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;If you people are criticizing Usama&#8217;s leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Allah), he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to me; and now this (his son Usama) is one of the dearest persons to me after him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 745, Vol. 5)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him; and if Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau, after him; and, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau after him; and if Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 628:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet and he was holding the hand of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar said to Him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You are dearer to me than everything except my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, (you will not have complete faith) till I am dearer to you than your own self.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;However, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Now, O &#8216;Umar, (now you are a believer).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 629:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men had a dispute in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One of them said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The other who was wiser, said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and allow me to speak. The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws: As for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you.&#8221; Then he scourged his son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think if the tribes of Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaina and Juhaina are better than the tribes of Tamim, &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;sa&#8217;a, Ghatfan and Asad, they (the second group) are despairing and losing?&#8221; They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Yes, (they are).&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, they (the first group) are better than them (the second group).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me as a present.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay at your father&#8217;s or mother&#8217;s house and see if you would be given presents or not?&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and praised and glorified Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then ! What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, &#8216;This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present&#8217;? Why didn&#8217;t he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I have preached you (Allah&#8217;s Message).&#8221; Abu Humaid said, &#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reached him (the Prophet ) while in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba; he was saying, &#8220;They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba! They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; I said (to myself ), &#8220;What is wrong with me? Is anything improper detected in me? What is wrong with me? Then I sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement. I could not remain quiet, and Allah knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, &#8216; Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Allah&#8217;s Cause).&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Solomon once said, &#8216;Tonight I will sleep with ninety women, each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On this, his companion said to him, &#8220;Say: Allah willing!&#8221; But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, &#8216;Allah willing&#8217; (all his wives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause as cavaliers. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara &#8216;bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A piece of silken cloth was given to the Prophet as a present and the people handed it over amongst themselves and were astonished at its beauty and softness. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Are you astonished at it?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the handkerchiefs of Sa&#8217;d in Paradise are better than it.&#8221;</p>

(Before I embraced Islam), there was no family on the surface of the earth, I wish to have degraded more than I did your family. But today there is no family whom I wish to have honored more than I did yours.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I thought similarly, by Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is!&#8221; Hind said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (My husband) Abu Sufyan is a miser. Is it sinful of me to feed my children from his property?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, unless you take it for your needs what is just and reasonable.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man heard another man reciting: Surat-ul-Ikhlas (The Unity) &#8216;Say: He is Allah, the One (112) and he was repeating it. The next morning he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the whole story to him as if he regarded the recitation of that Sura as insufficient On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! That (Sura No. 112) equals one-third of the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab while the latter was going with a group of camel-riders, and he was swearing by his father.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 644:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a relation of love and brotherhood between this tribe of Jarm and Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin. Once we were with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari, and then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was present, a man from the tribe of Taimillah who was of red complexion as if he were from non-Arab freed slaves. Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, &#8220;I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken.&#8221; On that, Abu Musa said, &#8220;Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash&#8217;ariyin and I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, &#8216;Where are the Ash-&#8216;ariyin?&#8217; He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Allah, we will never succeed.&#8217; So we went back to him and said to him, &#8216;We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.&#8217; On that he said, &#8216;I did not provide you with mounts, but Allah did. By Allah, if I take an oath to do something, and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better and make expiation for the dissolution of the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a gold ring made for himself, and he used to wear it with the stone towards the inner part of his hand. Consequently, the people had similar rings made for themselves. Afterwards the Prophet; sat on the pulpit and took it off, saying, &#8220;I used to wear this ring and keep its stone towards the palm of my hand.&#8221; He then threw it away and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never wear it.&#8221; Therefore all the people threw away their rings as well.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever swears by a religion other than Islam, is, as he says; and whoever commits suicide with something, will be punished with the same thing in the (Hell) Fire; and cursing a believer is like murdering him; and whoever accuses a believer of disbelief, then it is as if he had killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once a daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while Usama, Sa&#8217;d, and my father or Ubai were (sitting there) with him. She said, (in the message); My child is going to die; please come to us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned the messenger and told him to convey his greetings to her, and say, &#8220;Whatever Allah takes, is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world): so she should be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; Then she again sent for him swearing that he should come; so The Prophet got up, and so did we. When he sat there (at the house of his daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took him into his lap while the child&#8217;s breath was disturbed in his chest. The eyes of Allah&#8217;s Apostle started shedding tears. Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of whoever He wants of His slaves, and verily Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;The vow, does not bring about for the son of Adam anything I have not decreed for him, but his vow may coincide with what has been decided for him, and by this way I cause a miser to spend of his wealth. So he gives Me (spends in charity) for the fulfillment of what has been decreed for him what he would not give Me before but for his vow.&#8221;</p>

He added, &#8216;Then will come some people who will make vows but will not fulfill them; and they will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy, and they will give their witness without being asked to give their witness, and fatness will appear among them.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle headed towards the valley of Al-Qura, and when he was in the valley of Al-Qura an arrow was thrown by an unidentified person, struck and killed Mid&#8217;am who was making a she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Apostle kneel down. The people said, &#8220;Congratulations to him (the slave) for gaining Paradise.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, for the sheet which he stole from the war booty before its distribution on the day of Khaibar, is now burning over him.&#8221; When the people heard that, a man brought one or two Shiraks (leather straps of shoes) to the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;A Shirak of fire, or two Shiraks of fire.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 318: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Shaddad bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;The most superior way of asking for  forgiveness from Allah is: &#8216;Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta, Anta Khalaqtani wa  ana abduka, wa ana &#8216;ala ahdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, A&#8217;udhu bika min Sharri ma sana&#8217;tu,  abu&#8217;u Laka bini&#8217;matika &#8216;alaiya, wa Abu Laka bidhanbi faghfirli innahu la yaghfiru  adhdhunuba illa anta.&#8221; The Prophet added. &#8220;If somebody recites it during the day  with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the  people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies  before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 320: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud related to us two narrations: One from  the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were  sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person  considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like  this.&#8221; Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration.  (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the repentance  of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has  his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a  short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and  suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then  says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he  raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke  up, answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then slept. He got up  (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouth thereof and performed ablution not  using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got  up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching  him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on  his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered  thirteen Rak&#8217;at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath  as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the  approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer  without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij&#8217;al fi  qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam&#8217;i nuran, wa&#8217;an yamini nuran, wa&#8217;an yasari nuran,  wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj&#8217;al li nuran.&#8221;  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, &#8220;I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet  mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-&#8216;Abbas and he narrated  those seven things to me, mentioning, &#8216;(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my  blood, my hair and my body,&#8217; and he also mentioned two other things.&#8221; </font></p>

Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get  up, he said, &#8220;&#8216;Stay in your places,&#8221; and sat between us, till I felt the  coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you of a  thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say &#8216;Allahu  Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdu &#8216;illah&#8217;  thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221; Ibn Sirin said,  &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&#8221; </font></p>

In the  evening, the people made a large number of fires (for cooking meals). Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;What is this fire? What are you making the fire for?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;For cooking the meat of donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the pots  and break the pots!&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet divided something (among the Muslims) and  distributed the shares (of the booty). A man said, &#8220;This division has not been made  to please Allah.&#8221; When I informed the Prophet about it, he became so furious that I  noticed the signs of anger on his face and he then said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy  on Moses, for he was hurt with more than this, yet he remained patient.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Preach to the people once a week,  and if you won&#8217;t, then preach them twice, but if you want to preach more, then let it be  three times (a week only), and do not make the people fed-up with this Qur&#8217;an. If you come  to some people who are engaged in a talk, don&#8217;t start interrupting their talk by  preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if  they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say.  And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his  companions always avoided it.&#8221; </font></p>

(Let me join) the Highest Companions (see  Qur&#8217;an 4:69),&#8221; I said, &#8220;So, he does not choose us.&#8221; Then I realized that it  was the application of the statement he used to relate to us when he was healthy.

Behold ! There was a man  who, on quarreling with the people, used to be called as a son of a person other than his  father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; And then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah  as our Lord, and Islam as (our) religion, and Muhammad as (our) Apostle; and we seek  refuge with Allah from the afflictions.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; I have never  seen a day like today in its good and its evil for Paradise and the Hell Fire were  displayed in front of me, till I saw them just beyond this wall.&#8221; Qatada, when  relating this Hadith, used to mention the following Verse:&#8211; </font></p>

I seek refuge with you (Allah) from  (worries) care and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice,  from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other men.&#8221; I kept on  serving him till he returned from (the battle of) Khaibar. He then brought Safiya, the  daughter of Huyay whom he had got (from the booty). I saw him making a kind of cushion  with a cloak or a garment for her. He then let her ride behind him. When we reached a  place called As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite  the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of  his marriage to her. Then he proceeded till the mountain of Uhud appeared, whereupon he  said, &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it.&#8221; When he approached Medina, he  said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the land between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains a  sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (the people  of Medina) in their Mudd and the Sa&#8217; (units of measuring).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his father said, &#8220;In the year of Hajjatal-Wada&#8217;,  the Prophet paid me a visit while I was suffering from an ailment that had brought me to  the verge of death. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My sickness has reduced me to the (bad)  state as you see, and I am a rich man, but have no heirs except one daughter. Shall I give  2/3 of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then 1/2 of it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  1/3 is too much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in  poverty, begging from people. And (know that) whatever you spend in Allah&#8217;s Cause, you  will get reward for it, even for the morsel of food which you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left behind my companions (in Mecca)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If  you remain behind, whatever good deed you will do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will raise and upgrade  you to a higher position (in Allah&#8217;s Sight). May be you will live longer so that some  people may benefit by you, and some e others (pagans) may get harmed by you. O Allah!  Complete the migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels; But (we pity)  the poor Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sa&#8217;d) (died in Mecca)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle lamented (or pitied) for him as he died in Mecca.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he  used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his  Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has  advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my  head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with  this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who  has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which  are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the  dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and  returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion  of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured  me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn  and harm others with).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet) said, &#8220;On Friday there is a  particular time.

Be  gentle and beware of being harsh and of saying evil things.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t  you hear what they said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear what I replied (to them)?  have returned their statement to them, and my invocation against them will be accepted but  theirs against me will not be accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has some angels who look  for those who celebrate the Praises of Allah on the roads and paths. And when they find  some people celebrating the Praises of Allah, they call each other, saying, &#8220;Come to  the object of your pursuit.&#8217; &#8221; He added, &#8220;Then the angels encircle them with  their wings up to the sky of the world.&#8221; He added. &#8220;(after those people  celebrated the Praises of Allah, and the angels go back), their Lord, asks them (those  angels)&#8212;-though He knows better than them&#8212;-&#8216;What do My slaves say?&#8217; The angels reply,  &#8216;They say: Subhan Allah, Allahu Akbar, and Alham-du-lillah, Allah then says &#8216;Did they see  Me?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;No! By Allah, they didn&#8217;t see You.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah says, How it would have been if they saw Me?&#8217; The  angels reply, &#8216;If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate Your  Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to anything more often.&#8217;  Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;What do they ask Me for?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They ask You for  Paradise.&#8217; Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;Did they see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No! By Allah, O  Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels  say, &#8216;If they saw it, they would have greater covetousness for it and would seek It with  greater zeal and would have greater desire for it.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;From what do they seek  refuge?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;Did they  see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No By Allah, O Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it  would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;If they saw it they would flee from it  with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.&#8217; Then Allah says, &#8216;I make  you witnesses that I have forgiven them.&#8221;&#8216; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;One of the  angels would say, &#8216;There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he  had just come for some need.&#8217; Allah would say, &#8216;These are those people whose companions  will not be reduced to misery.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet started ascending a high place or hill. A man  (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice, &#8220;La ilaha  illal-lahu wallahu Akbar.&#8221; (At that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle was riding his mule.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one.&#8221; and  added, &#8220;O Abu Musa (or, O &#8216;Abdullah)!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No  calamity befalls a Muslim but that Allah expiates some of his sins because of it, even  though it were the prick he receives from a thorn.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No fatigue, nor disease, nor  sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he  receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer is that  of a fresh tender plant, which the wind bends lt sometimes and some other time it makes it  straight. And the example of a hypocrite is that of a pine tree which keeps straight till  once it is uprooted suddenly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The example of a believer is  that of a fresh tender plant; from whatever direction the wind comes, it bends it, but  when the wind becomes quiet, it becomes straight again. Similarly, a believer is afflicted  with calamities (but he remains patient till Allah removes his difficulties.) And an  impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allah cuts  (breaks) it down when He wishes.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 558, Vol. 9.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I visited the Prophet during his ailments and he was  suffering from a high fever. I said, &#8220;You have a high fever. Is it because you will  have a double reward for it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any  harm but that Allah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.&#8221; </font></p>

How shall I dispose of (distribute) my  property?&#8221; He did not reply till the Verse of inheritance was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them and asked, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr, he would recite the following poetic  verses: &#8216;Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death is nearer to him than his  shoe laces.&#8221; And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic  lines): &#8216;Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by  Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of  the water of Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear  to me.&#8217; Then I came and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, whereupon he said, &#8220;O  Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy  and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and put it in Al&#8217;Juhfa.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said that while he. Sad and Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  were with the Prophet a daughter of the Prophet sent a message to him, saying. &#8216;My  daughter is dying; please come to us.&#8221; The Prophet sent her his greetings and added  &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and what He gives; and everything before His sight  has a limited period. So she should hope for Allah&#8217;s reward and remain patient.&#8221; She  again sent a message, beseeching him by Allah, to come. So the Prophet got up. and so did  we (and went there). The child was placed on his lap while his breath was irregular. Tears  flowed from the eyes of the Prophet. Sad said to him, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;This Is Mercy which Allah has embedded in the hearts of  whomever He wished of His slaves. And Allah does not bestow His Mercy, except on the  merciful among His slaves. (See Hadith No. 373 Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya  velvet covering. He mounted me behind him and went to visit Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, and that had  been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded till he passed by a gathering in  which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that had been before &#8216;Abdullah  embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the donkey  covered the gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and  said, &#8220;Do not trouble us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and  dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them  some verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &#8220;O man ! There is  nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our  gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.&#8221;  On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our  gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing  each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they  became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon  Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &#8220;O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&#8221; Sad said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for  Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town (Medina decided  unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his head, but  when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was  grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way  you have seen.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 572: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to visit me during my ailment which  had been aggravated during Hajjat-al-Wada&#8217;. I said to him, &#8220;You see how sick I am. I  have much property but have no heir except my only daughter May I give two thirds of my  property in charity?&#8221;! He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One third is too much,  for to leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging of others. Nothing  you spend seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure but you shall get a reward for it, even for what you  put in the mouth of your wife.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 573: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house  there were some people among whom was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come,  let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough  for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some said &#8220;Go  near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go  astray,&#8221; while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before  the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn &#8216;Abbas  used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from writing  that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 574: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated As-Sa&#8217;ib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My aunt took me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My nephew is- ill.&#8221; The Prophet touched my head with his hand and  invoked Allah to bless me. He then performed ablution and I drank of the remaining water  of his ablution and then stood behind his back and saw &#8220;Khatam An-Nubuwwa&#8221; (The  Seal of Prophethood) between his shoulders like a button of a tent. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 575: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None of you should wish for death  because of a calamity befalling him; but if he has to wish for death, he should say:  &#8220;O Allah! Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is  better for me.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 576: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais bin Abi Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had  been branded (cauterized) at seven places in his body. He said, &#8220;Our companions who  died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (this world) without having their rewards  reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we have got (so much) wealth that  we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings Had the Prophet not  forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.&#8217; We visited him for the second  time while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for  whatever he spends except for something that he spends on building.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 577: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The good deeds of any  person will not make him enter Paradise.&#8221; (i.e., None can enter Paradise through his  good deeds.) They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8216;Not even you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He  said, &#8220;Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.&#8221; So be  moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and none  of you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds,  and if he is an evil doer, he may repent to Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet , who was resting against me, saying,  &#8220;O Allah! Excuse me and bestow Your Mercy on me and let me join with the highest  companions (in Paradise).&#8221; See Qur&#8217;an (4.69) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 579: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle paid a visit to a patient, or a  patient was brought to him, he used to invoke Allah, saying, &#8220;Take away the disease,  O the Lord of the people! Cure him as You are the One Who cures. There is no cure but  Yours, a cure that leaves no disease.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 580: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came to me while I was ill. He performed  ablution and threw the remaining water on me (or said, &#8220;Pour it on him) &#8221; When I  came to my senses I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have no son or father to be my heir,  so how will be my inheritance?&#8221; Then the Verse of inheritance was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 581: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them and said, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, &#8220;Everybody is  staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.&#8221; And  when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): &#8220;Would that I could  stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds  of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and  would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!&#8221; I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him about that. He said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina  as much or more than we love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd,  and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.&#8221; (See Hadith No 558) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 336: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we assumed  the state of Ihram of Hajj and arrived at Mecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet  ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and (Sa&#8217;i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa  and use our lhram just for &#8216;Umra, and finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hadi  with us. None of us had the Hadi with him except the Prophet and Talha. 1AIj came from  Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;I had assumed the state of Ihram with the  same intention as that with which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had assumed it. The people said,  &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought  the Hadi, and had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; Suraqa  (bin Malik) met the Prophet while he was throwing pebbles at the Jamrat-al-&#8216;Aqaba, and  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this (permitted) for us only?&#8221; The Prophet  replied. &#8220;No, it is forever&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was  menstruating, therefore the Prophet ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj  except the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she  became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You  are proceeding after performing both Hajj and &#8216;Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj  only?&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to  At-Tan&#8217;im, and so she performed the &#8216;Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days of the Hajj. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night the Prophet was unable to sleep and said,  &#8220;Would that a righteous man from my companions guarded me tonight.&#8221; Suddenly we  heard the clatter of arms, whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; It was said,  &#8220;I am Sa&#8217;d, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have come to guard you.&#8221; The Prophet then slept  so soundly that we heard him snoring. Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;Aisha said: Bilal said,  &#8220;Would that I but stayed overnight in a valley with Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of  grass) around me (i.e., in Mecca).&#8221; Then I told that to the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Not to wish to be the like  except of two men. A man whom Allah has given the (knowledge of the) Qur&#8217;an and he recites  it during the hours of night and day and the one who wishes says: If I were given the same  as this (man) has been given, I would do what he does, and a man whom Allah has given  wealth and he spends it in the just and right way, in which case the one who wishes says,  &#8216;If I were given the same as he has been given, I would do what he does.&#8217; &#8221; (See  Hadith No. 543 and 544, Vol 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the Maula of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar) Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;None of you should long for death, for if he is a good man, he may increase  his good deeds, and if he is an evil-doer, he may stop the evil deeds and repent.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was carrying earth with us on the day of the  battle of Al-Ahzab (confederates) and I saw that the dust was covering the whiteness of  his abdomen, and he (the Prophet ) was saying, &#8220;(O Allah) ! Without You, we would not  have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O  Allah!) please send tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of the enemy tribes)  have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us and  fight against us) then we would not (flee but withstand them). And the Prophet used to  raise his voice with it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet fasted Al-Wisal on the last days of the month.  Some people did the same, and when the news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If the  month had been prolonged for me, then I would have fasted Wisal for such a long time that  the most exaggerating ones among you would have given up their exaggeration. I am not like  you; my Lord always makes me eat and drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade Al-Wisal. The people said (to him),  &#8220;But you fast Al-&#8216;Wisal,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who among you is like me? When I sleep  (at night), my Lord makes me eat and drink. But when the people refused to give up  Al-Wisal, he fasted Al-Wisal along with them for two days and then they saw the crescent  whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared I would have fasted for  a longer period,&#8221; as if he intended to punish them herewith. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet about the wall (outside the Ka&#8217;ba).  &#8220;Is it regarded as part of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t the people include it in the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Because)  your people ran short of money.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Then why is its gate so high?&#8221;  He replied, &#8221;Your people did so in order to admit to it whom they would and forbid whom  they would. Were your people not still close to the period of ignorance, and were I not  afraid that their hearts might deny my action, then surely I would include the wall in the  Ka&#8217;ba and make its gate touch the ground.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Judgments (Ahkaam) </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.251">Volume 9, Book 89, Number 251: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah,  and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah, and whoever obeys the ruler I appoint, obeys me,  and whoever disobeys him, disobeys me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 252: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Surely! Everyone of you is a  guardian and is responsible for his charges: The Imam (ruler) of the people is a guardian  and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family (household) and  is responsible for his subjects; a woman is the guardian of her husband&#8217;s home and of his  children and is responsible for them; and the slave of a man is a guardian of his master&#8217;s  property and is responsible for it. Surely, everyone of you is a guardian and responsible  for his charges.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 253: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was included in a delegation of Quraish  staying with Muawiya, Muawiya heard that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr had said that there would be a  king from Qahtan tribe, whereupon he became very angry. He stood up, and after glorifying  and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed, I have come to know that some  of you men are narrating things which are neither in Allah&#8217;s Book, nor has been mentioned  by Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Such people are the ignorant among you. Beware of such vain desires  that mislead those who have them. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;This matter (of  the caliphate) will remain with the Quraish, and none will rebel against them, but Allah  will throw him down on his face as long as they stick to the rules and regulations of the  religion (Islam).'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 254: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This matter (caliphate) will  remain with the Quraish even if only two of them were still existing.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 255: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not wish to be like anyone,  except in two cases: (1) A man whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it righteously.  (2) A man whom Allah has given wisdom (knowledge of the Quran and the Hadith) and he acts  according to it and teaches it to others.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.256"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 256: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You should listen to and obey,  your ruler even if he was an Ethiopian (black) slave whose head looks like a raisin.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 257: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody sees his Muslim ruler  doing something he disapproves of, he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from  the Muslim group even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the  Pre-lslamic period of ignorance (as rebellious sinners). (See Hadith No. 176 and 177) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.258"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 258: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A Muslim has to listen to and obey  (the order of his ruler) whether he likes it or not, as long as his orders involve not one  in disobedience (to Allah), but if an act of disobedience (to Allah) is imposed one should  not listen to it or obey it. (See Hadith No. 203, Vol. 4) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.259"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 259: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent an army unit (for some campaign) and  appointed a man from the Ansar as its commander and ordered them (the soldiers) to obey  him. (During the campaign) he became angry with them and said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the Prophet  order you to obey me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I order you to  collect wood and make a fire and then throw yourselves into it.&#8221; So they collected  wood and made a fire, but when they were about to throw themselves into, it they started  looking at each other, and some of them said, &#8220;We followed the Prophet to escape from  the fire. How should we enter it now?&#8221; So while they were in that state, the fire  extinguished and their commander&#8217;s anger abated. The event was mentioned to the Prophet  and he said, &#8220;If they had entered it (the fire) they would never have come out of it,  for obedience is required only in what is good.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 629. Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.260"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 260: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Do not seek to be  a ruler, for if you are given authority on your demand then you will be held responsible  for it, but if you are given it without asking (for it), then you will be helped (by  Allah) in it. If you ever take an oath to do something and later on you find that  something else is better, then you should expiate your oath and do what is better.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.261"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 261: </font></p>

Do  not seek to be a ruler, for if you are given authority on your demand, you will be held  responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped  (by Allah) in it. If you ever take an oath to do something and later on you find that  something else is better, then do what is better and make expiation for your oath.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 262: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You people will be keen to have the  authority of ruling which will be a thing of regret for you on the Day of Resurrection.  What an excellent wet nurse it is, yet what a bad weaning one it is!&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.263"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 263: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Two men from my tribe and I entered upon the Prophet. One  of the two men said to the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Appoint me as a  governor,&#8221; and so did the second. The Prophet said, &#8220;We do not assign the  authority of ruling to those who ask for it, nor to those who are keen to have it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.264"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ma&#8217;qil: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Any man whom Allah has  given the authority of ruling some people and he does not look after them in an honest  manner, will never feel even the smell of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.265"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 265: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ma&#8217;qil: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If any ruler having the  authority to rule Muslim subjects dies while he is deceiving them, Allah will forbid  Paradise for him.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.089.266"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 266: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Tarif Abi Tamima: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Safwan and Jundab and Safwan&#8217;s companions when Jundab  was advising. They said, &#8220;Did you hear something from Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Jundab  said, &#8220;I heard him saying, &#8216;Whoever does a good deed in order to show off, Allah will  expose his intentions on the Day of Resurrection (before the people), and whoever puts the  people into difficulties, Allah will put him into difficulties on the Day of  Resurrection.'&#8221; The people said (to Jundab), &#8220;Advise us.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;The first thing of the human body to purify is the abdomen, so he who can eat  nothing but good food (Halal and earned lawfully) should do so, and he who does as much as  he can that nothing intervene between him and Paradise by not shedding even a handful of  blood, (i.e. murdering) should do so.&#8221; </font></p>

A man passed by her  and asked her, &#8216;What has Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I did not recognize  him.&#8217; The man said, &#8216;He was Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;&#8216; Anas added, &#8220;So that woman came  to the gate of the Prophet and she did not find a gate-keeper there, and she said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah. I did not recognize you!&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;No doubt, patience  is at the first stroke of a calamity.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakra wrote to his son who was in Sijistan: &#8216;Do not  judge between two persons when you are angry, for I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;A  judge should not judge between two persons while he is in an angry mood.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! By Allah, I fail to attend the morning congregational prayer because so-and-so  (i.e., Muadh bin Jabal) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it.&#8221; I had never  seen the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. He then said,  &#8220;O people! some of you make others dislike (good deeds, i.e. prayers etc). So whoever  among you leads the people in prayer, he should shorten it because among them there are  the old, the weak and the busy (needy having some jobs to do).

Allah&#8217;s Apostles used to give me gifts and I used to say to him, &#8216;Give it to a more needy  one than me.&#8217; Once he gave me some money and I said, &#8216;Give it to a more needy person than  me,&#8217; whereupon the Prophet said, &#8216;Take it and keep it in your possession and then give it  in charity.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in the mosque,  and called him, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have committed illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet turned his face to the other side, but when the man gave  four witnesses against himself, the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; The man  said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to his companions), &#8220;Take him away and  stone him to death. &#8221; </font></p>

So if ever I judge (by error) and give the right of a brother to  his other (brother) then he (the latter) should not take it, for I am giving him only a  piece of Fire.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 638, Vol. 3). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qatada: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the Day of (the battle of) Hunain,  &#8220;Whoever has killed an infidel and has a proof or a witness for it, then the salb  (arms and belongings of that deceased) will be for him.&#8221; I stood up to seek a witness  to testify that I had killed an infidel but I could not find any witness and then sat  down. Then I thought that I should mention the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle I (and when I did  so) a man from those who were sitting with him said, &#8220;The arms of the killed person  he has mentioned, are with me, so please satisfy him on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;No, he will not give the arms to a bird of Quraish and deprive one of Allah&#8217;s lions  of it who fights for the cause of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle I stood up  and gave it to me, and I bought a garden with its price, and that was my first property  which I owned through the war booty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of Hijaz said, &#8220;A judge should not pass a  judgment according to his knowledge, whether he was a witness at the time he was the judge  or before that&#8221; And if a litigant gives a confession in favor of his opponent in the  court, in the opinion of some scholars, the judge should not pass a judgment against him  till the latter calls two witnesses to witness his confession. And some people of Iraq  said, &#8220;A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the  litigant&#8217;s confession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes place outside the  court, he should not pass the judgment unless two witnesses witness the confession.&#8221;  Some of them said, &#8220;A judge can pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the  case as he is trust-worthy, and that a witness is Required just to reveal the truth. The  judge&#8217;s knowledge is more than the witness.&#8221; Some said, &#8220;A judge can judge  according to his knowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases he  cannot.&#8221; Al-Qasim said, &#8220;A judge ought not to pass a judgment depending on his  knowledge if other people do not know what he knows, although his knowledge is more than  the witness of somebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the Muslims  and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt. &#8221; </font></p>

By Him in Whose Hand my life is, whoever takes anything illegally will bring  it on the Day of Resurrection by carrying it over his neck: if it is a camel, it will be  grunting: if it is a cow, it will be mooing: and if it is a sheep it will be  bleating!&#8221; The Prophet then raised both his hands till we saw the whiteness of his  armpits (and he said), &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message?&#8221; And he  repeated it three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was some quarrel (sighting) among Bani &#8216;Amr, and when  this news reached the Prophet, he offered the Zuhr prayer and went to establish peace  among them. In the meantime the time of &#8216;Asr prayer was due, Bilal pronounced the Adhan  and then the Iqama for the prayer and requested Abu Bakr (to lead the prayer) and Abu Bakr  went forward. The Prophet arrived while Abu Bakr was still praying. He entered the rows of  praying people till he stood behind Abu Bakr in the (first) row. The people started  clapping, and it was the habit of Abu Bakr that whenever he stood for prayer, he never  glanced side-ways till he had finished it, but when Abu Bakr observed that the clapping  was not coming to an end, he looked and saw the Prophet standing behind him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet beckoned him to carry on by waving his hand.  Abu Bakr stood there for a while, thanking Allah for the saying of the Prophet and then he  retreated, taking his steps backwards. When the Prophet saw that, he went ahead and led  the people in prayer. When he finished the prayer, he said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What  prevented you from carrying on with the prayer after I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu  Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Abi Quhafa to lead the Prophet in  prayer.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to the people, &#8220;If some problem arises during  prayers, then the men should say, Subhan Allah!; and the women should clap.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 652, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr sent for me owing to the large number of  casualties in the battle of Al-Yamama, while &#8216;Umar was sitting with him. Abu Bakr said (to  me), &#8216;Umar has come to my and said, &#8216;A great number of Qaris of the Holy Quran were killed  on the day of the battle of Al-Yamama, and I am afraid that the casualties among the Qaris  of the Quran may increase on other battle-fields whereby a large part of the Quran may be  lost. Therefore I consider it advisable that you (Abu Bakr) should have the Qur&#8217;an  collected.&#8217; I said, &#8216;How dare I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8217; &#8216;Umar  said, By Allah, it is something beneficial.&#8217; &#8216;Umar kept on pressing me for that till Allah  opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chest of &#8216;Umar and I had in that  matter, the same opinion as &#8216;Umar had.&#8221; Abu Bakr then said to me (Zaid), &#8220;You  are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the  Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for the fragmentary scripts  of the Quran and collect it (in one Book).&#8221; Zaid further said: By Allah, if Abu Bakr  had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one place to another it would  not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said (to  &#8216;Umar and Abu Bakr), &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not  do?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is something beneficial.&#8221; Zaid added: So  he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Allah opened my chest for that for which  He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, and I had in that matter, the same opinion  as theirs. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So I started compiling the Quran by collecting it from the  leafless stalks of the date-palm tree and from the pieces of leather and hides and from  the stones, and from the chests of men (who had memorized the Quran). I found the last  verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: (&#8220;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from  amongst yourselves&#8211;&#8216; (9.128-129) ) from Khuzaima or Abi Khuzaima and I added to it the  rest of the Sura. The manuscripts of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him  unto Him. Then it remained with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and then with Hafsa  bint &#8216;Umar. </font></p>

Muhaiyisa went to the Jews and said, &#8220;By Allah, you have  killed my companion.&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;By Allah, we have not killed him.&#8221;  Muhaiyisa then came back to his people and told them the story. He, his elder brother  Huwaiyisa and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the Prophet) and he who had been at Khaibar,  proceeded to speak, but the Prophet said to Muhaiyisa, &#8220;The eldest! The eldest!&#8221;  meaning, &#8220;Let the eldest of you speak.&#8221; So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then  Muhaiyisa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews should either pay the blood money of your  (deceased) companion or be ready for war.&#8221; After that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wrote a letter  to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;Can you take an oath by  which you will be entitled to take the blood money?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He  said (to them), &#8220;Shall we ask the Jews to take an oath before you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;But the Jews are not Muslims.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave them  one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself. Sahl added: When those she-camels were  made to enter the house, one of them kicked me with its leg. </font></p>

Judge  between us according to Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws).&#8221; His opponent stood up and said,  &#8220;He has said the truth, so judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The  bedouin said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for this man and committed illegal sexual  intercourse with his wife. The people said to me, &#8216;Your son is to be stoned to death,&#8217; so  I ransomed my son for one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious  learned men and they said to me, &#8216;Your son has to receive one hundred lashes plus one year  of exile.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s  Book (Laws)! As for the slave girl and the sheep, it shall be returned to you, and your  son shall receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O you, Unais!&#8221; The  Prophet addressed some man, &#8220;Go in the morning to the wife of this man and stone her  to death.&#8221; So Unais went to her the next morning and stoned her to death. </font></p>

I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a  mooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Allah.&#8221; Then the Prophet raised both his  hands till I saw the whiteness of his armpits, and said, &#8220;(No doubt)!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The group of people whom &#8216;Umar had selected as candidates  for the Caliphate gathered and consulted each other. Abdur-Rahman said to them, &#8220;I am  not going to compete with you in this matter, but if you wish, I would select for you a  caliph from among you.&#8221; So all of them agreed to let &#8216;Abdur-Rahman decide the case.  So when the candidates placed the case in the hands of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, the people went  towards him and nobody followed the rest of the group nor obeyed any after him. So the  people followed &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and consulted him all those nights till there came the night  we gave the oath of allegiance to &#8216;Uthman. Al-Miswar (bin Makhrama) added: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  called on me after a portion of the night had passed and knocked on my door till I got up,  and he said to me, &#8220;I see you have been sleeping! By Allah, during the last three  nights I have not slept enough. Go and call Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d.&#8217; So I called them for him  and he consulted them and then called me saying, &#8216;Call &#8216;Ali for me.&#8221; I called &#8216;Ali  and he held a private talk with him till very late at night, and then &#8216;Al, got up to leave  having had much hope (to be chosen as a Caliph) but &#8216;Abdur-Rahman was afraid of something  concerning &#8216;Ali. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said to me, &#8220;Call &#8216;Uthman for me.&#8221; I called  him and he kept on speaking to him privately till the Mu&#8217;adhdhin put an end to their talk  by announcing the Adhan for the Fajr prayer. When the people finished their morning prayer  and that (six men) group gathered near the pulpit, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman sent for all the  Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar present there and sent for the army chief who had  performed the Hajj with &#8216;Umar that year. When all of them had gathered, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Now  then, O &#8216;Ali, I have looked at the people&#8217;s tendencies and noticed that they do not  consider anybody equal to &#8216;Uthman, so you should not incur blame (by disagreeing).&#8221;  Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said (to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;I gave the oath of allegiance to you on  condition that you will follow Allah&#8217;s Laws and the traditions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the  traditions of the two Caliphs after him.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman gave the oath of  allegiance to him, and so did the people including the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar  and the chiefs of the army staff and all the Muslims. </font></p>

(2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to an Imam (ruler) and gives it only for  worldly benefits, if the Imam gives him what he wants, he abides by his pledge, otherwise  he does not fulfill his pledge; (3) and a man who sells something to another man after the  &#8216;Asr prayer and swears by Allah (a false oath) that he has been offered so much for it  whereupon the buyer believes him and buys it although in fact, the seller has not been  offered such a price.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 838, Vol. 3) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman came to the Prophet and spoke to him about  something and he told her to return to him. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I come  and do not find you?&#8221; (As if she meant, &#8220;&#8230;if you die?&#8221;) The Prophet said,  &#8220;If you should not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr said to the delegate of Buzakha. &#8220;Follow the  tails of the camels till Allah shows the Caliph (successor) of His Prophet and  Al-Muhajirin (emigrants) something because of which you may excuse yourselves &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;There will be twelve  Muslim rulers (who will rule all the Islamic world).&#8221; He then said a sentence which I  did not hear. My father said, &#8220;All of them (those rulers) will be from Quraish.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life  is, I was about to order for collecting fire wood and then order someone to pronounce the  Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the people in prayer and then I would  go from behind and burn the houses of men who did not present themselves for the  (compulsory congregational) prayer. By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if anyone of you had  known that he would receive a bone covered with meat or two (small) pieces of meat present  in between two ribs, he would come for &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 617, Vol. 1) </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 88:</p>
<h3 align="center">Afflictions and the End of the World</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.088.172"></a>Volume 9, Book 88, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me whereupon I will say, &#8216;My followers!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You do not know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'&#8221; (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, &#8220;Allah, we seek refuge with You from turning on our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial&#8221;).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 173:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar) and some men amongst you will be brought to me, and when I will try to hand them some water, they will be pulled away from me by force whereupon I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my companions!&#8217; Then the Almighty will say, &#8216;You do not know what they did after you left, they introduced new things into the religion after you.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 174:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar), and whoever will come to it, will drink from it, and whoever will drink from it, will never become thirsty after that. There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: &#8220;I will say those people are from me. It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.&#8217; Then I will say, &#8216;Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me! &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 175:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;You will see after me, selfishness (on the part of other people) and other matters that you will disapprove of.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What do you order us to do, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? (under such circumstances)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Pay their rights to them (to the rulers) and ask your right from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 176:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever disapproves of something done by his ruler then he should be patient, for whoever disobeys the ruler even a little (little = a span) will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. (i.e. as rebellious Sinners).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 177:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever notices something which he dislikes done by his ruler, then he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from the company of the Muslims even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance (as rebellious sinners). (Fateh-Al-Bari page 112, Vol. 16)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Junada bin Abi Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We entered upon &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit while he was sick. We said, &#8220;May Allah make you healthy. Will you tell us a Hadith you heard from the Prophet and by which Allah may make you benefit?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet called us and we gave him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam, and among the conditions on which he took the Pledge from us, was that we were to listen and obey (the orders) both at the time when we were active and at the time when we were tired, and at our difficult time and at our ease and to be obedient to the ruler and give him his right even if he did not give us our right, and not to fight against him unless we noticed him having open Kufr (disbelief) for which we would have a proof with us from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 179:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usaid bin Hudair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You appointed such-and-such person and you did not appoint me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;After me you will see rulers not giving you your right (but you should give them their right) and be patient till you meet me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 180:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the truthful and trusted by Allah (i.e., the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;The destruction of my followers will be through the hands of young men from Quraish.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet got up from his sleep with a flushed red face and said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil that is nearly approaching them. Today a gap has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this.&#8221; (Sufyan illustrated by this forming the number 90 or 100 with his fingers.) It was asked, &#8220;Shall we be destroyed though there are righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if evil increased.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 182:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood over one of the high buildings of Medina and then said (to the people), &#8220;Do you see what I see?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I see afflictions falling among your houses as rain drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 183:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time will pass rapidly, good deeds will decrease, miserliness will be thrown (in the hearts of the people) afflictions will appear and there will be much &#8216;Al-Harj.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is &#8220;Al-Harj?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Killing! Killing!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 63, Vol. 8)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Near the establishment of the Hour there will be days during which Religious ignorance will spread, knowledge will be taken away (vanish) and there will be much Al-Harj, and Al-Harj means killing.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 185:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>

Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) Town (Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, your properties, your honors and your skins (i.e., bodies) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness (for it).

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will be its taint?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8221; I said, &#8220;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met &#8216;Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).&#8217; (4.97)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 208:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&#8217;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&#8217;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &#8220;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&#8217;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &#8216;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&#8217; and later it will be said about some man, &#8216;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&#8217; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</p>

You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins.&#8221; Salama replied, &#8220;No, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert.&#8221; Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: When &#8216;Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.</p>

So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.&#8221; I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,&#8221; Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe!

Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! And also on our Najd.&#8221; I think the third time the Prophet said, &#8220;There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'&#8221; (2.193) Ibn &#8216;Umar said (to the man), &#8220;Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &#8220;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&#8221; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &#8216;Umar came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &#8216;Uthman came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get permission for you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &#8216;Uthman is separate from theirs.&#8221;)</p>

I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn&#8217;t you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?&#8217; That man will say, &#8216;I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ammar stood on the pulpit at Kufa and mentioned &#8216;Aisha and her coming (to Busra) and said, &#8220;She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter, but you people are being put to test in this issue.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa and Abii Mas&#8217;ud went to &#8216;Ammar when &#8216;Ali had sent him to Kufa to exhort them to fight (on &#8216;Ali&#8217;s side). They said to him, &#8220;Since you have become a Muslim, we have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to us than your haste in this matter.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Since you (both) became Muslims, I have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to me than your keeping away from this matter.&#8221; Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud provided &#8216;Ammar and Abu Musa with two-piece outfits to wear, and one of them went to the mosque (of Kufa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sitting with Abu Mas&#8217;ud and Abu Musa and &#8216;Ammar. Abu Mas&#8217;ud said (to &#8216;Ammar), &#8220;There is none of your companions but, if I wish, I could find fault with him except with you. Since you joined the company of the Prophet I have never seen anything done by you more criticizable by me than your haste in this issue.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, O Abu Mas&#8217;ud ! I have never seen anything done by you or by this companion of yours (i.e., Abu Musa) more criticizable by me than your keeping away from this issue since the time you both joined the company of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud who was a rich man, said (to his servant), &#8220;O boy! Bring two suits.&#8221; Then he gave one to Abu Musa and the other to &#8216;Ammar and said (to them), &#8220;Put on these suits before going for the Friday prayer. &#8220;</p>

On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, &#8220;Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, &#8220;Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Hasan (bin &#8216;Ali) came and the Prophet said, &#8216;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra&#8217; (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, &#8220;O Abu Barza! Don&#8217;t you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?&#8221; The first thing heard him saying &#8220;I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman said, &#8216;The hypocrites of today are worse than those of the lifetime of the Prophet, because in those days they used to do evil deeds secretly but today they do such deeds openly.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Soon the river &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;raj narrated from Abii Huraira that the Prophet said the same but he said, &#8220;It (Euphrates) will uncover a mountain of gold (under it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Haritha bin Wahb:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Give in charity because there will come a time on the people when a person will go out with his alms from place to place but will not find anybody to accept it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religious scholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions will appear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance &#8212;- so abundant that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, &#8216;I am not in need of it, (9) till the people compete with one another in constructing high buildings, (10) till a man when passing by a grave of someone will say, &#8216;Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) &#8216;No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.&#8217; (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nobody asked the Prophet as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;What worries you about him?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because the people say that he will have a mountain of bread and a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Nay, he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Allah&#8221;&#8216; (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream) performing Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;The son of Mary.&#8217; Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape. They said (to me), He is Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;The man he resembled most is Ibn Qatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a. &#8220;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware!

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day Allah&#8217;s Apostle narrated to us a long narration about Ad-Dajjal and among the things he narrated to us, was: &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come, and he will be forbidden to enter the mountain passes of Medina. He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there will appear to him a man who will be the best or one of the best of the people. He will say &#8216;I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story Allah&#8217;s Apostle has told us.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), &#8216;Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;No,&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, &#8216;By Allah, now I recognize you more than ever!&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill him (again) but he will not be given the power to do so.&#8221;</p>

Zainab bint Jahsh added: I said, &#8220;O Alllah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.085">Volume 9, Book 86, Number 85: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;O people! The reward of deeds depends  upon the intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he has  intended. So, whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration was for  Allah and His Apostle, and whoever emigrated to take worldly benefit or for a woman to  marry, then his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah does not accept prayer of  anyone of you if he does Hadath (passes wind) till he performs the ablution (anew).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Abu Bakr wrote for him, Zakat regulations which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made compulsory, and wrote that one should neither collect various  portions (of the property) nor divide the property into various portions in order to avoid  paying Zakat. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 88: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  prayers.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to offer perfectly the five (compulsory)  prayers in a day and a night (24 hrs.), except if you want to perform some extra optional  prayers.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  fasting.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to observe fast during the month of  Ramadan except if you fast some extra optional fast.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me  what Allah has enjoined on me as regard Zakat.&#8221; The Prophet then told him the Islamic  laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, &#8220;By Him Who has honored you, I will  not perform any optional deeds of worship and I will not leave anything of what Allah has  enjoined on me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He will be successful if he has told the  truth (or he will enter Paradise if he said the truth).&#8221; And some people said,  &#8220;The Zakat for one-hundred and twenty camels is two Hiqqas, and if the Zakat payer  slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them as a present or plays some other trick  in order to avoid the Zakat, then there is no harm (in it) for him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 89: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the  Kanz (Treasure or wealth of which, Zakat has not been paid) of anyone of you will appear  in the shape of a huge bald headed poisonous male snake and its owner will run away from  it, but it will follow him and say, &#8216;I am your Kanz.'&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;By  Allah, that snake will keep on following him until he stretches out his hand and let the  snake swallow it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;If the owner of camels does not pay  their Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection those camels will come to him and will  strike his face with their hooves.&#8221; Some people said: Concerning a man who has  camels, and is afraid that Zakat will be due so he sells those camels for similar camels  or for sheep or cows or money one day before Zakat becomes due in order to avoid payment  of their Zakat cunningly! &#8220;He has not to pay anything.&#8221; The same scholar said,  &#8220;If one pays Zakat of his camels one day or one year prior to the end of the year (by  the end of which Zakat becomes due), his Zakat will be valid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 90t: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada Al-Ansari sought the verdict of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle regarding a vow made by his mother who had died before fulfilling it. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Fulfill it on her behalf.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If the number  of camels reaches twenty, then their owner has to pay four sheep as Zakat; and if their  owner gives them as a gift or sells them in order to escape the payment of Zakat cunningly  before the completion of a year, then he is not to pay anything, and if he slaughters them  and then dies, then no Zakat is to be taken from his property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.090"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 90: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Nafi narrated to me that &#8216;Abdullah said that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade the Shighar. I asked Nafi&#8217;, &#8220;What is the Shighar?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;It is to marry the daughter of a man and marry one&#8217;s daughter to that man (at the  same time) without Mahr (in both cases); or to marry the sister of a man and marry one&#8217;s  own sister to that man without Mahr.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one, by a trick,  marries on the basis of Shighar, the marriage is valid but its condition is illegal.&#8221;  The same scholar said regarding Al-Mut&#8217;a, &#8220;The marriage is invalid and its condition  is illegal.&#8221; Some others said, &#8220;The Mut&#8217;a and the Shighar are permissible but  the condition is illegal.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.091"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 91: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali was told that Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not see any harm in the  Mut&#8217;a marriage. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the Mut&#8217;a marriage on the Day of  the battle of Khaibar and he forbade the eating of donkey&#8217;s meat.&#8221; Some people said,  &#8220;If one, by a tricky way, marries temporarily, his marriage is illegal.&#8221; Others  said, &#8220;The marriage is valid but its condition is illegal.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;One should not prevent others  from watering their animals with the surplus of his water in order to prevent them from  benefiting by the surplus of grass.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.094"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 94: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man mentioned to the Prophet that he had always been  cheated in bargains. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whenever you do bargain, say, &#8216;No  cheating.'&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.095"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 95: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he asked &#8216;Aisha regarding the Verse: &#8216;If you fear that  you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your  choice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her  guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less  than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they  treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning women..&#8217; (4.127) (The sub-narrator then mentioned the Hadith.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 97: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and you  people have disputes. May be some one amongst you can present his case in a more eloquent  and convincing manner than the other, and I give my judgment in his favor according to  what I hear. Beware! If ever I give (by error) somebody something of his brother&#8217;s right  then he should not take it as I have only, given him a piece of Fire.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 638. Vol. 3) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.098"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 98: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A virgin should not be married till  she is asked for her consent; and the matron should not be married till she is asked  whether she agrees to marry or not.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How will  she(the virgin) express her consent?&#8221; He said, &#8220;By keeping silent.&#8221; Some  people said, &#8220;If a virgin is not asked for her consent and she is not married, and  then a man, by playing a trick presents two false witnesses that he has married her with  her consent and the judge confirms his marriage as a true one, and the husband knows that  the witnesses were false ones, then there is no harm for him to consummate his marriage  with her and the marriage is regarded as valid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.099"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 99: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Qasim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman from the offspring of Ja&#8217;far was afraid lest her  guardian marry her (to somebody) against her will. So she sent for two elderly men from  the Ansar, &#8216;AbdurRahman and Mujammi&#8217;, the two sons of Jariya, and they said to her,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, for Khansa&#8217; bint Khidam was given by her father in marriage against  her will, then the Prophet cancelled that marriage.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 78) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.100"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 100: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Haraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A lady slave should not be  given in marriage until she is consulted, and a virgin should not be given in marriage  until her permission is granted.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;How will she express her  permission?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By keeping silent (when asked her  consent).&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man, by playing a trick, presents two false  witnesses before the judge to testify that he has married a matron with her consent and  the judge confirms his marriage, and the husband is sure that he has never married her  (before), then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and he may live with her  as husband.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.101"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 101: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is essential to have the  consent of a virgin (for the marriage). I said, &#8220;A virgin feels shy.&#8221; The  Prophet; said, &#8220;Her silence means her consent.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man  falls in love with an orphan slave girl or a virgin and she refuses (him) and then he  makes a trick by bringing two false witnesses to testify that he has married her, and then  she attains the age of puberty and agrees to marry him and the judge accepts the false  witness and the husband knows that the witnesses were false ones, he may consummate his  marriage.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.102"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 102: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to like sweets and also used to like  honey, and whenever he finished the &#8216;Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with  them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay,  so I enquired about it. It was said to me, &#8220;A woman from her tribe gave her a leather  skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  drink.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, we will play a trick on him.&#8221; So I mentioned the  story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to her, &#8220;When he enters upon you,  he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you  eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then you say to him, &#8216;What is this bad smell? &#8216; And it  would be very hard on Allah&#8217;s Apostle that a bad smell should be found on his body. He  will say, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; Then you should say to him, &#8216;Its bees  must have sucked from the Al-&#8216;Urfut (a foul smelling flower).&#8217; I too, will tell him the  same. And you, O Saifya, say the same.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So when the Prophet entered upon Sauda (the following  happened). Sauda said, &#8220;By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was  about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of  fear from you. But when Allah &#8216;s Apostle came near to me, I said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What about this smell?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Its bees must have sucked  Al-&#8216;Urfut.&#8217; &#8221; When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he  entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said  to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;I have no desire for it.&#8221; Sauda said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived him of it  (honey).&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 103: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir bin Rabi&#8217;a: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab left for Sham, and when he reached a  placed called Sargh, he came to know that there was an outbreak of an epidemic (of plague)  in Sham. Then &#8216;AbdurRahman bin &#8216;Auf told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If you hear  the news of an outbreak of an epidemic (plague) in a certain place, do not enter that  place: and if the epidemic falls in a place while you are present in it, do not leave that  place to escape from the epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar returned from Sargh. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Usama bin Zaid speaking to Sa&#8217;d, saying,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the plague and said, &#8216;It is a means of punishment with  which some nations were punished and some of it has remained, and it appears now and then.  So whoever hears that there is an outbreak of plague in some land, he should not go to  that land, and if the plague breaks out in the land where one is already present, one  should not run away from that land, escaping from the plague.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 105: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who takes back his gift is  like a dog swallowing its own vomit, and we (believers) should not act according to this  bad example.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 106: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet has decreed that preemption is valid in all  cases where the real estate concerned has not been divided, but if the boundaries are  established and the ways are made, then there is no preemption. A man said,  &#8220;Preemption is only for the neighbor,&#8221; and then he makes invalid what he has  confirmed. He said, &#8220;If someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the  neighbor (of the house) may buy it through preemption, he buys one share out of one  hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can  only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house;  and the buyer may play such a trick in this case.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 107: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Ash-Sharid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Miswar bin Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder  and I accompanied him to Sa&#8217;d. Abu Rafi&#8217; said to Al-Miswar, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you order this  (i.e. Sa&#8217;d) to buy my house which is in my yard?&#8221; Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;I will not offer  more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period.&#8221; Abu Rafi said, &#8220;I  was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;A  neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,&#8217; I would not have sold it  to you.&#8221; The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma&#8217;mar did not say so. Sufyan said, &#8220;But  he did say so to me.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If someone wants to sell a house and  deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render  the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and  marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand  Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Ash-Sharid: Abu Rafi&#8217; said that Sa&#8217;d  offered him four hundred Mithqal of gold for a house. Abu Rafi &#8216; said, &#8220;If I had not  heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his  neighbor,&#8217; then I would not have given it to you.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one has  bought a portion of a house and wants to cancel the right of preemption, he may give it as  a present to his little son and he will not be obliged to take an oath.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.108"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 108: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to  collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim&#8217;s tribe. When he returned, the Prophet called him to  account. He said (to the Prophet, &#8216;This is your money, and this has been given to me as a  gift.&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay in your father&#8217;s and  mother&#8217;s house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the  truth?&#8221; Then the Prophet addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he  said: &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du&#8221;, I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what  Allah has put under my custody, and then he comes to me and says, &#8216;This is your money and  this has been given to me as a gift. Why didn&#8217;t he stay in his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s home  to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Allah, not anyone of you takes a thing  unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do  not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep  on meeting Allah.&#8221; Then the Prophet raised both his hands till the whiteness of his  armpits became visible, and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Haven&#8217;t I have conveyed (Your  Message)?&#8221; The narrator added: My eyes witnessed and my ears heard (that Hadith). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.109"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 109: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Rafi&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The neighbor has more right to be  taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else).&#8221; Some men said, &#8220;If one wants  to buy a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive  somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 20,000 Dirhams but paying to the  seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in  cash for the rest of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000  Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy it (by this trick he  got out of preemption). If the house proves to belong to somebody else other than the  seller, the buyer should take back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams  and one Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the whole  bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the house and it does not  belong to somebody other than the seller, the buyer may return it and receive 20,000  Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.&#8217; Abu &#8216;Abdullah  said, &#8220;So that man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims  (although) the Prophet said, &#8216;In dealing with Muslims one should not sell them sick  (animals) or bad things or stolen things.&#8221; </font></p>

Be hard upon the tribe of Mudar and  inflict years (of famine) upon them like the (famine) years of Joseph.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever possesses the  (following) three qualities will have the sweetness of faith (1): The one to whom Allah  and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything else; (2) Who loves a person and he loves him  only for Allah&#8217;s Sake; (3) who hates to revert to atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be  thrown into the Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid saying, &#8220;I have seen myself  tied and forced by &#8216;Umar to leave Islam (Before &#8216;Umar himself embraced Islam). And if the  mountain of Uhud were to collapse for the evil which you people had done to &#8216;Uthman, then  Uhud would have the right to do so.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 202, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 76: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Art: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (about our state) while he  was leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba. We said, &#8220;Will you ask  Allah to help us? Will you invoke Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among those who were  before you a (believer) used to be seized and, a pit used to be dug for him and then he  used to be placed in it. Then a saw used to be brought and put on his head which would be  split into two halves. His flesh might be combed with iron combs and removed from his  bones, yet, all that did not cause him to revert from his religion. By Allah! This  religion (Islam) will be completed (and triumph) till a rider (traveler) goes from San&#8217;a&#8217;  (the capital of Yemen) to Hadramout fearing nobody except Allah and the wolf lest it  should trouble his sheep, but you are impatient.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 191, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were in the mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out to us  and said, &#8220;Let us proceed to the Jews.&#8221; So we went along with him till we  reached Bait-al-Midras (a place where the Torah used to be recited and all the Jews of the  town used to gather). The Prophet stood up and addressed them, &#8220;O Assembly of Jews!  Embrace Islam and you will be safe!&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;O Aba-l-Qasim! You have  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;That is what I want (from  you).&#8221; He repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, &#8220;You  have conveyed Allah&#8217;s message, O Aba-l-Qasim.&#8221; Then he said it for the third time and  added, &#8220;You should Know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want  to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns some property, can sell it,  otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 392, Vol. 4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Should the  women be asked for their consent to their marriage?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  said, &#8220;A virgin, if asked, feels shy and keeps quiet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her  silence means her consent.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man from the Ansar made his slave, a Mudabbar. And apart  from that slave he did not have any other property. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  he said, &#8220;Who will buy that slave from me?&#8221; So Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him  for 800 Dirham.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham migrated  with his wife Sarah till he reached a town where there was a king or a tyrant who sent a  message, to Abraham, ordering him to send Sarah to him. So when Abraham had sent Sarah,  the tyrant got up, intending to do evil with her, but she got up and performed ablution  and prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah ! If I have believed in You and in Your Apostle, then do not  empower this oppressor over me.&#8217; So he (the king) had an epileptic fit and started moving  his legs violently. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Verse: &#8216;It is those who believe and confuse not  their belief with wrong (i.e., worshipping others besides Allah): (6.82) was revealed, it  became very hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, &#8220;Who among us has  not confused his belief with wrong (oppression)?&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;This is not meant (by the Verse). Don&#8217;t you listen to Luqman&#8217;s statement: &#8216;Verily!  Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.&#8217; (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to &#8216;Ali and he burnt  them.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa said, &#8220;I came to the Prophet along with two  men (from the tribe) of Ash&#8217;ariyin, one on my right and the other on my left, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was brushing his teeth (with a Siwak), and both men asked him for some  employment. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Abu Musa (O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!).&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Him Who  sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did  not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.&#8217; As if I were looking now at his  Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, &#8216;We never (or, we do not)  appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais!) Go to Yemen.'&#8221; The Prophet then sent Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal after him and when  Mu&#8217;adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit  on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu&#8217;adh asked,  &#8220;Who is this (man)?&#8221; Abu Muisa said, &#8220;He was a Jew and became a Muslim and  then reverted back to Judaism.&#8221; Then Abu Muisa requested Mu&#8217;adh to sit down but  Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of  Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that  the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, &#8220;Then we discussed the night  prayers and one of us said, &#8216;I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allah will reward me for my  sleep as well as for my prayers.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and  some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! How can you fight  these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered to fight the people till  they say: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, &#8216;and whoever said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;, Allah will save his property and his life from me,  unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account  will be with Allah?&#8217; &#8220;Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight whoever  differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property  (according to Allah&#8217;s Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to  pay to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards  the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8216;As-Samu  &#8216;Alaika.'&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Allah is kind and lenient and likes that one should be kind and  lenient in all matters.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard what they said?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I said (to them), &#8216;Wa &#8216;Alaikum (and upon you). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by  Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if  I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I  may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying,  &#8220;During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the  best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith)  and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was distributing (something, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Dhil Khawaisira At-Tamimi came and said, &#8220;Be just, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin  Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Allow me to cut off his neck ! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221;  Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and  your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison  to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game&#8217;s body  in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and  when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined,  nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood.  The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast)  will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will  appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims).&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id added: I  testify that I heard this from the Prophet and also testify that &#8216;Ali killed those people  while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet was brought to  &#8216;Ali. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira At-Tarnimi): &#8216;And among them are men who accuse you (O  Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.&#8217; (9.58) </font></p>

Join not in worship others with  Allah, Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.'&#8221;  (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Hibban bin &#8216;Atiyya had a dispute. Abu  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said to Hibban, &#8220;You know what made your companions (i.e. Ali) dare to  shed blood.&#8221; Hibban said, &#8220;Come on! What is that?&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said,  &#8220;Something I heard him saying.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;What was it?&#8221;  &#8216;AbdurRahman said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu  Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, &#8216;Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama  said that Abu &#8216;Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a  letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.&#8217;  So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib had  written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Allah&#8217;s Apostle against them. We  asked her, &#8220;Where is the letter which is with you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t got any  letter.&#8217; So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8216;We do not think that she has got a letter.&#8217; I said, &#8216;We  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not told a lie.'&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Ali took an oath saying, &#8220;By Him by Whom one  should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your  clothes.&#8221; She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and  brought out the paper (letter). They took the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me  chop off his neck!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What obliged you to do what  you have done?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why (for what reason) should  I not believe in Allah and His Apostle? But I intended to do the (Mecca) people a favor by  virtue of which my family and property may be protected as there is none of your  companions but has some of his people (relatives) whom Allah urges to protect his family  and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has said the truth; therefore, do not say  anything to him except good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has  betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Allah  might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), &#8216;Do what you like, for I  have granted you Paradise?&#8217; &#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar&#8217;s eyes became flooded with tears and he  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>
