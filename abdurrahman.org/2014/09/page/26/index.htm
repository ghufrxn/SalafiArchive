And as for those who have a yearning for error    they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain    them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge    say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of    understanding who really heed&#8221; (iii. 6). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported that Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see    such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned    verses).</font></p>

I thus met him and asked him about things    which he narrated from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And amongst these the    one he mentioned was that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah does    not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes away the scholars and    consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves amongst persons the    ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without (adequate) knowledge and    themselves go astray and lead others astray. &#8216;Urwa said: When I narrated this to &#8216;A&#8217;isha,    she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed reluctance to accept that (as    perfectly true) and said to, &#8216;Urwa: Did he (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr) say to you that he had    heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: (&#8216;Urwa had forgotten to ask this    from &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr). So when it was the next year, she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said to him (&#8216;Urwa):    Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him. talk to him and ask him about this hadith that    he narrated to You (last year on the occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge. He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time. So when I informed her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) about    that, she said: I do not think but this that he has certainly told the truth and I find    that be has neither made any addition to it, nor missed anything from it.</font></p>

He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

I touched his body with my bard and said    to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you are running high temperature, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) said: Yes, it is so.

A woman from amongst them said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, even    if they (the children who die) are two. Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet, ) said: Even if    they are two.</font></p>

He said: You assemble on    such and such a day. They assembled and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to    them and taught them what Allah had taught him and he then said: No woman amongst you who    sends her three children as her forerunners (in the Hereafter) but they would serve him as    a protection against Hell-Fire. A woman said: What about two and two and two? Thereupon    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Even if they are two and two and two.</font></p>

Would you narrate to me anything from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) a hadith which would soothe our hearts in our bereavements? He said: Yes. Small    children are the fowls of Paradise. If one of them meets his father (or he said his    parents) he would take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as I take hold of the    hem of your cloth (with my hand). And he (the child) would not take off (his hand) from it    until Allah causes his father to enter Paradise. This hadith has been narrated on the    authority of Tamim with the same chain of transmitters. And he is reported to have said:    Did you hear from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) anything which may soothe our    heart in our bereavements? He said: Yes.</font></p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa. reported: I set out with the intention (of meeting) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and came to know that he had gone to the gardens (in the suburb of Medina). I followed him and found him in a garden sitting upon an elevated place round the well with his shanks uncovered which had been dangling in the well. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that there is no mention of the words of Sa&#8217;id: all drew a conclusion from it pertaining to their graves.&#8221;</p>

Abi Sufyin appointed Sa&#8217;d as the Governor and said: What prevents you from abusing Abu Turab (Hadrat &#8216;Ali), whereupon be said: It is because of three things which I remember Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said about him that I would not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camelg. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say about &#8216;Ali as he left behind hrin in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). &#8216;All said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children.

And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call &#8216;Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:&#8221; Let us summon our children and your children.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali, Fitima, Hasan and Husain and said: O Allah, they are my family.</p>

Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they?

<p style="text-align:justify;">Mus&#8217;ab b. Sa&#8217;d reported on the authority of his father that many verses of the Qur&#8217;an had been revealed in connection with him. His mother Umm Sa&#8217;d had taken oath that she would never talk with him until he abandoned his faith and she neither ate nor drank and said: Allah has commanded you to treat well your parents and I am your mother and I command you to do this. She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sa&#8217;d that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an:&#8221; And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&#8221; (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world&#8221; (xxxi. 15). He also reported that there fell to the lot of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) huge spoils of war and there was one sword in them. I picked that up and came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of one&#8217;s property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

The people objected to his command, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and said: You object to his command and before this you objected to the command of his father (Zaid). By Allah, he was fit as the commander and he was one of the dearest of persons to me and after him, behold! this one (Usama) is one of the dearest of persons to me.</p>

She further said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say in his last illness in which he&#8217; died. I heard him saying in gruffness of the voice: Along with those persons upon whom Allah bestowed favours from amongst the Apostles, the testifiers of truth, the martyrs, the pious and goodly company are they (iv. 69). (It was on bearing these words) that I thought that he had been given choice (and he opted to live with these pious persons in the Paradise).</p>

(On hearing these words), I then said (to myself) He is not going to opt us and I remembered a hadith which he had narrated to us as he was healthy and in which he said: No prophet dies until he sees his abode in Paradise, he is then given a choice. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: These were the last words which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) spoke (the words are): O Allah, with companions on High.</p>

She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) thus missed (the company of the Holy Prophet) and when they sat down, &#8216;A&#8217;isha felt jealous. She put her foot in the grass and said: O Allah, let the scorpion sting me or the serpent bite me. And so far as thy Messenger is concerned, I cannot say anything about him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b.

Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son.

When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning.

He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca.

He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that.

Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam.

Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mubammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i. e.

I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said. And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have never transmitted anything (to anybody):&#8221; Those who conceal the clear evidence and the guidance that We revealed&#8221; (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had been free from the Battle of Hunain, he sent Abu &#8216;Amir as the head of the army of Autas. He had an encounter with Duraid b. as_Simma. Duraid was killed and Allah gave defeat to his friends. Abu Musa said: He (the Holy Prophet) sent me along with Abu &#8216;Amir and Abu &#8216;Amir received a wound in his knee from the arrow, (shot by) a person of Bani Jusham. It stuck in his knee. I went to him and said: Uncle, who shot an arrow upon you? Abu &#8216;Amir pointed out to Abu Musa and said: Verily that one who shot an arrow upon me in fact killed me. Abu Musa said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don&#8217;t you feel ashamed (that you run), aren&#8217;t you an Arab? Why don&#8217;t you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu &#8216;Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on his sides. I narrated to him what had happened to us and narrated to him about Abu Amir and said to him that he had made a request to the effect that forgiveness should be sought for him (from Allah). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be. upon him) called for water and performed ablution with it. He then lifted his hands and said. O Allah, grant pardon to Thy servant Abu Amir. (The Holy Prophet had raised his hands so high for supplication) that I saw the whiteness of his armpits. He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, forgive the sins of Abdullah b. Qais (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) and admit him to an elevated place on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Burda said: One prayer is for abu &#8216;Amir and the other is tor Abu Musa.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa reported: We were in Yemen when we heard of the migration of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We also set out as immigrants to him. And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

He then lifted his head towards the sky and it often happened that as he lifted his head towards the sky, he said: The stars are a source of security for the sky and when the stars disappear there comes to the sky, i. e.

And I am a source of safety and security to my Companions and when I would go away there would fall to the lot (of my Companions) as they have been promised with and my Companions are a source of security for the Umma and as they would go there would fall to the lot of my Umma as (its people) have been promised.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Usair b. Jabir reported that when people from Yemen came to help (the Muslim army at the time of jihad) he asked them: Is there amongst you Uwais b. &#8216;Amir? (He continued finding him out) until he met Uwais. He said: Are you Uwais b., Amir? He said: Yes. He said: Are you from the tribe of Qaran? He said: Yes. He (Hadrat) &#8216;Umar (again) said: Did you suffer from leprosy and then you were cured from it but for the space of a dirham? He said: Yes. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Is your mother (living)? He said: Yes. He (&#8216;Umar) said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: There would come to you Uwais b. Amir with the reinforcement from the people of Yemen. (He would be) from Qaran, (the branch) of Murid. He had been suffering from leprosy from which he was cured but for a spot of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been excellent. If he were to take an oath in the name of Allah, He would honour that. And if it is possible for you, then do ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from your Lord). So he (Uwais) begged forgiveness for him. Umar said: Where do you intend to go? He said: To Kufa. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. When it was the next year, a person from among the elite (of Kufa) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uwais. He said: I left him in a state with meagre means of sustenance. (Thereupon) Umar said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would come to you Uwais b. &#8216;Amir, of Qaran, a branch (of the tribe) of Murid, along with the reinforcement of the people of Yemen. He had been suffering from leprosy which would have been cured but for the space of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been very kind. If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for something) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?</p>

So when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility because of blood-tie or relationship of marriage (with them). And when you see two persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick, than get out of that. He (Abu Dharr) said: I saw Abd al-Rahman b. Shurahbil b.

The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of Hadrat &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Allah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar went away. The stand &#8216;Abdullah (b. &#8216;Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma&#8217; (bint Abu Bakr, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s mother). But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. &#8216;Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.</p>

He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

Then there is a land hard and barren which retains water and the people derive benefit from it and they drink it and make the animals drink. Then there is another land which is barren. Neither water is retained in it, nor is the grass grown in it. And that is the similitude of the first one who develops the understanding of the religion of Allah and it becomes a source of benefit to him with which Allah sent me.

I would strike away from it (the Cistern) with my staff the people of Yemen until the water (of the Haud) would spout forth upon them. He was asked about its breadth. He said: From this place of mine to &#8216;Amman, and he was asked about the drink and he said: It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. There would spout into it two streamlets having their sources in Paradise. the one is from gold and the other is from silver. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters and the words are:&#8221; I would be on the Day of Resurrection near the bank of the Cistern.&#8221;</p>

Malik reported that something was conveyed to him (the Holy prophet) about his Companions, so he addressed them and said: Paradise and Hell were presented to me and I have never seen the good and evil as (I did) today. And if you were to know you would have wept more and laughed less. He (the narrator) said: There was nothing more burdensome for the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) than this. They covered their heads and the sound of weeping was heard from them. Then there stood up &#8216;Umar and he said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as our Apostle, and it was at that time that a person stood up and he said: Who is my father? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Your father is so and so; and there was revealed the verse:&#8221; O you who believe, do not ask about matters which, if they were to be made manifest to you (in terms of law), might cause to you harm&#8221; (v. 101).</p>

She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

One day when he (Moses) was taking bath (alone) he placed his clothes upon a stone, but the stone began to move along with his clothes. Moses raced after it saying: My garment, stone; until (some of the people) of Banu Isra&#8217;il looked at the private parts of Moses, and they said: By Allah, there is no trouble with Moses. The stone stopped after he (Moses) had been seen. He took hold of his garments and struck the stone. Abu Huraira said: I swear by Allah that there were six or seven scars on the stone because of the striking of stone by Moses (peace be upon him).</p>

I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there.

You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Salutations and Greetings  (Kitab As-Salam) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way  the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a  society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators  of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the  pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good  Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no  spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one&#8217;s mornings and  evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the  time of meeting are as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance  behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within  and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on  every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be  constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness  of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind.  peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting  in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted  but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the  blessing of peace. (The pronoun&#8217;Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come  within its orbit.) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The two words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum may be called the  irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been  commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another  in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum are generally  suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings).  These three words:&#8221; peace&#8230;, mercy&#8221; and&#8221; blessings of Allah&#8221; in fact  form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another  these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in  perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of  as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this  essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the  whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility  of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for  it. </font></p>

He stood by us and said: What about you apd your meetings on the paths?    Avoid these meetings on the paths. We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of    doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation    amongst ourselves. Thereupon he said: If there is no help (for you but to sit on these    paths), then give the paths their rights and these are lowering of the gaze, exchanging of    greetings and good conversation.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas reported: Umar b. Khattab set out for    Syria. As he came at Sargh (a town by the side of Hijaz on the way to Syria), there met    him the commander of the forces, Abu Ubaida b. Jandb, and his companions. They informed    him that a scourge had broken out in Syria. Ibn &#8216;Abbas further reported that &#8216;Umar said:    Call to me tile earliest emigrants. So I called them. He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) sought their    advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a    difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in    such a situation). Some of them said: You (&#8216;Umar) have set forth for a task, and,    therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along    with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we would not advise you to go forth towards    this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).    He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: You can now go away. He said: Call to me the Ansar. So I called    them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the    Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can    go. He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the    Victory (that is the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and Hadrat &#8216;Umar consulted them)    and not even two persons differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They    said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go    to this scourge, So &#8216;Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on    the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu &#8216;Ubaida b. Jarrah    said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Had it been    someone else to say this besides you! &#8216;Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing    (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine    Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in    a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren,    would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And    in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according    to the Divine Decree.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There happened to come &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf and he had    been absent in connection with some of his needs. He said: I have with me a knowledge of    it, that I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you hear of its    presence (the presence of plague) in a land, don&#8217;t enter it, but if it spreads in the land    where you are, don&#8217;t fly from it. Thereupon &#8216;Umar b. Khattab praised Allah and then went    back?</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Salama h. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf reported Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, but he is    also reported to have said: A sick person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Abu    Salama said that Abu Huraira used to narrate these two (different ahadith) from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him), but afterwards Abu Huraira became silent on these    words:&#8221; There is no transitive disease,&#8221; but he stuck to this that the sick    person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Harith b. Abu Dhubab (and he was the    first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated    to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but    now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of    that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith,    however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words    in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said:    No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu    Huraira in fact used to report Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said:    There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he    deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah. Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported: A person from the Ansar who    was amongst the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) reported to me: As    we were sitting during the night with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), a meteor    shot gave a dazzling light. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you    say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and    His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very    night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on    the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do    a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of    heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of    this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of    the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then    the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the    heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages    to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack    them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but    they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</font></p>

I looked towards it and found a snake. I    jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit    down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and    said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had    been newly wedded. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate    in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family.

The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing    between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her    with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house    until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on    the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in    the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died    first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and    made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to    life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in    Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning    to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a    devil.</font></p>

The person said: This dog    has suffered from thirst as I had suffered from it. He climbed down into the well, filled    his shoe with water, then caught it in his mouth until he climbed up and made the dog    drink it. So Allah appreciated this act of his and pardoned him.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have    sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment    (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. why is it    that you look at me like this. whereas you yourself presented it to me?

Thereupon that woman said: I read the Qur&#8217;an from cover to cover, but I did    not find that in it. whereupon he said: If you had read (thoroughly) you would have    definitely found this in that (as) Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has said:&#8221; What    Allah&#8217;s Messenger brings for you accept that. and what he has forbidden you. refrain from    that.&#8221; That woman said: I find this thing in your wife even now. Thereupon he said:    Go and see her. She reported: I went to the wife of &#8216;Abdullah but found nothing of this    sort in her. She came back to him and said: I have not seen anything. whereupon he said:    Had there been anything like it in her, I would have never slept with her in the bed.</font></p>

Khalid al-Juhani reported: A person asked Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him) about a lost camel; Rabi&#8217;a made this addition: He (the    Holy Prophet) was so much annoyed that his cheeks became red.&#8221; The rest of the hadith    is the same. He (the narrator) made this addition:&#8221; If its (that of the article)    owner comes and he recognises the bag (which contained it) and its number, and the strap.    then give that to them, but if not, then it is for you.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) was asked about picking up of stray things, whereupon he said:    Make announcement of that for one year, but if it is not recognised (by the owner), then    recognise its big and strap, then eat it; and if its owner comes, then give that to him.    This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Al-Dahhak b. Uthman with the same chain    of transmitters but with a slight variation of words.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Salama b. Kuhail reported: I heard Sowaid b. Ghafala say: I    went out, and also Zaid b. Suhan and Salman b. Rabi&#8217;a for Jibad, and I found a whip and    took it up. They said to me: Leave it. I said: No. but I will make announcement of it and    if its owner comes (then I will return that), otherwise I will use it, and I refused them.    When we returned from Jihad. by a good fortune for me, I performed Pilgrimage. I came to    Medina and met Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b, and related to him the affair of the whip and their opinion    (the opinion of Zaid b. Suhan and Salman b. Rabi&#8217;a) about it (i. e. I should throw it).    Thereupon he said: I found a money bag during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) which contained one hundred dinars. I came to him along with it, and he said:    Make an announcement of it for one year; so I announced it, but did not find anyone who    could (claim it after) recognising it. I again came to him and he said: Make announcement    for one year. So I made announcement of it, but I found none who could recognise it. I    came to him he said: Make announcement of it for one year. I made announcement of that but    did not find one who could recognise it, whereupon he said: Preserve (in your mind) its    number, its bag and its strap, and if its owner comes (then return that to him), otherwise    make use of it. So I made use of that. I (Shu&#8217;ba) met him (Salama b. Kuhail) after this in    Mecca, and he said: I do not know whether he said three years or one year.</font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 13:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Bequests (Kitab Al-Wasiyya) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bequest (WasIyya) or will is defined as a transfer to come into operation after the testator&#8217;s death. The testator is called Musi, and the legatee or devisee is called Musa lahu, and the executor is called Wasi. It is a spiritual testament of a man enabling him to make up his shortcomings in the worldly life and securing rewards in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Shar&#8217;iah, one is entitled to make a will for one-third of one&#8217;s property and not beyond that so that the rights of the legal heirs are not adversely affected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Again, the principle on which the legality of a testamentary disposition is based being in defeance pro tanto of the rights of heirs generally the law requires that such disposition should be for the benefit of non-heirs alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; A further reason why a bequest in favour of an heir is not allowed is that it would amount to giving preference to some heirs over others, thus defeating the spirit of the law which has fixed the portion of each in the inheritance and causing disputes among persons related to one another. If the other heirs consent to a bequest to one of them or to a bequest of more than one-third of the estate, the above reasons no longer hold good and the bequest as made will be valid&#8221; (Abdur Rahim, The Principles of Muhammadan jurisprudence, pp. 311-2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, preferable and most advisable not to will away the property if the legal heirs are poor, because it manifests benevolence to the heirs who have superior claim to it from the relations in which they stand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another principle which is observed in case of bequest is that the proprietary right of a legatee in a bequest is establislied if he accepts it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Amir b. Sa&#8217;d reported on the authority of his father (Sa&#8217;d b. Abi Waqqas): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me in my illness which brought me near death in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am afflicted and I am a man possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of my property) as Sadaqa? He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity) and that is quite enough. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging from people; that you would never incur an expense seeking therewith the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded therefor, even for a morsel of food that you put in the mouth of your wife. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. would I survive my companions? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a deed by means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status (in religion) and prestige; you may survive so that people would benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah, complete for my Companions their migration, and not cause them to turn back upon their heels. Sa&#8217;d b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt grief for him as he had died in Mecca.</p>

He said: No. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: Then one-third? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yes), one-third, and one-third is quite substanial. And what you spend as charity from your property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your family is also Sadaqa, and what your wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and that you leave your heirs well off (or he said: prospreous) is better than to leave them (poor and) begging from people. He (the Holy Prophet) pointed this with his hands.</p>

He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have acquired land in Khaibar. I have never acquired property more valuable for me than this, so what do you command me to do with it? Thereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) said: If you like, you may keep the corpus intact and give its produce as Sadaqa. So &#8216;Umar gave it as Sadaqa declaring that property must not be sold or inherited or given away as gift. And Umar devoted it to the poor, to the nearest kin, and to the emancipation of slaves, aired in the way of Allah and guests. There is no sin for one, who administers it if he eats something from it in a reasonable manner, or if he feeds his friends and does not hoard up goods (for himself).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar reported: I acquired land from the lands of Khaibar. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have acquired a piece of land. Never have I acquired land more loved by me and more cherished by me than this. The rest of the hadith is the same, but he made no mention of this:&#8221; I narrated it to Muhammad&#8221; and what follows.</p>

He said: NO. I said: Then why has making of will been made necessary for the Muslims, or why were they commanded to make will? Thereupon he said: He made the will according to the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic.</p>

He (Ibn &#8216;Abbas) said: The illness of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took a serious turn (on this day), and he said: Come to me, so that I should write for you a document that you may not go astray after me. They (the Companions around him) disputed, and it is not meet to dispute in the presence of the Apostle. They said: How is lie (Allah&#8217;s Apostle)? Has he lost his consciousness? Try to learn from him (this point). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Leave me. I am better in the state (than the one in which you are engaged). I make a will about three things: Turn out the polytheists from the territory of Arabia; show hospitality to the (foreign) delegations as I used to show them hospitality. He (the narrator) said: He (Ibn Abbas) kept silent on the third point, or he (the narrator) said: But I forgot that.</p>

Thereupon Umar said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is deeply afflicted with pain. You have the Qur&#8217;an with you. The Book of Allah is sufficient for us. Those who were present in the house differed. Some of them said: Bring him (the writing material) so that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) may write a document for you and you would never go astray after him And some among them said what &#8216;Umar had (already) said.

So he (that person) came and said (to the Holy    Prophet): A child was born in my house and I wanted to give him the name (of Muhammad)    after the name of Allah&#8217;s Messenger, whereas my people did not allow me that I should name    him after that (sacred) name until I have asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in    this connection, whereupon he said: Give him the name after my name, but do not call him    by my kunya, for I have been sent as a Qasim as I distribute amongst you.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr.    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down    one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass)    in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217;. I saught to    give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the    price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib was busy in    drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said:    Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and    cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to    Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps    altogether. Ibn Shihab reported &#8216;Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it    shocked me, and I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b,    Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I    also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza    raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from    them.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Husain b. &#8216;Ali reported &#8216;Ali having said: There fell to my    lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth    reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage    with Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), I prevailed upon a    goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217; to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir    wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding    feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two    she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I    collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps    had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken    out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that?    They said: Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in    the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his    companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels.    Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped    their haunches and tore out their livers. &#8216;Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) recognised from my face what I had experienced,    whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you? I    said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this    day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and    ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing    this) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it on    him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of    the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they    granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to    reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza&#8217;s eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his    eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then    Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and    came out, and we also came out along with him.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas b. Malik reported: I was the cup-bearer of some people    in the house of Abu Talha on the day when liquor was forbidden. Their liquor had been    prepared from dry dates or fresh dates when the announcer made the announcement. He (Abu    Talha) said to me: Go out and find out (what the announcement is). I got out (and found)    an announcer making this announcement: Behold, liquor has been declared unlawful. He said:    The liquor (was spilt and) flawed in the lanes of Medina. Abu Talha said to me: Go out and    Spill it, and I spilt it. They said or some of them said: Such and such were killed, such    and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their stomachs. He (the narrator) said. I    do not know whether it is the narration transmitted by Anas, (or by someone else). Then    Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:&#8221; There shall be no sin (imputed) unto    those who have believed and done good works for what they may have eaten as long as they    fear (Allah) and believe and do good works&#8221; (v. 93).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abd al-Aziz b. Suhaib reported: They (some persons) asked    Anas b. Malik, about Fadikh (that is, a wine prepared from fresh dates), whereupon he    said: There was no liquor with us except this Fadikih of yours. It was only this Fadikh    that I had been serving to Abu Talha and Abu Ayyub and some persons from amongst the    Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in our house. When a person    came and said: Has the news reached you? We said, No. He said: Verily liquor has been    declared forbidden. Thereupon, Abd Talha said: Anas, spill these large pitchers. He (the    narrator) said: They then never reverted to it, nor even asked about this after the    announcement by that person.</font></p>

They said: Anas, spill it away. So I    spilt it. He (one of the narrators. Sulaiman Taimi) said that he asked Anas what that was    (the Fadikh). He said: It had been prepared from unripe and ripe dates. Abu Bakr b. Anas    said: It was their liquor in those days. Sulaiman said: A person narrated it to me from    Anas b.

So I came and found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with some    people. He looked at me, and I felt shy and said: Accept the invitation of Abu Talha. He    (the Holy Prophet) asked the people to get up. Thereupon Abu Talha said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, I have prepared something for you. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    touched (the food) and invoked blessings upon it, and then said: Let ten persons from my    Companions enter (the house). He then said: Eat, and (in the meanwhile) brought out    something from between his fingers for them. They then began to eat until they had their    fill and then went out. He then asked ten more men (to have the meal) and they ate to    their fill, and the ten persons went on getting in (and eating the food) and then getting    out until none was left amongst them who had not got in and eaten to his fill. He then    collected (the remaining part of the food) and it (the quantity of the food) was the same    (as it had been prior to the serving of guests).</font></p>

They said: (He has done    that to relieve) his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the daughter    of Milhan, and said to him: Father, I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having    bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said that    it was due to hunger. Abu Talha came to mv mother and said: Is there anything? She said:    Yes, I have some pieces of bread with me and some dates. If Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) comes to us alone we can feed him to his fill, but if someone comes along    with him this would be insufficient for them.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Miqdad reported: I and two of my companions were so much    afflicted by hunger that we had lost our power of seeing and hearing. We presented    ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), but    none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may    peace be upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us    drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (It    was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner    that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go    to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night    the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the    Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no    need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had    penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest    it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! what have you done?    You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find    it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this    world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon    my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered,    and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what    I had done. There came Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he greeted as he used    to greet (by saying as-Salamu &#8216;Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer    and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He    raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was    going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said:    Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me drink. I held tight the    sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the    goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them were    milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and    milked them in that until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night? I said:    Drink it. and he drank it; he then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, drink it, and he drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then    perceived that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had been satiated and I had got his    blessings. I burst into laughter (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs.    I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, this affair of mind is like this and this. and I have done so.    Thereupon. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: This is nothing but a mercy from    Allah. Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened    our two friends and they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has    sent you with Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other)    people happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.</font></p>

And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the other with mutton) and    we all ate out of them to our hearts&#8217; content, but (still) some part was (left) in (those)    two bowls, and I placed it on the camel- (or words to the same effect).</font></p>

It was (in accordance with these instructions of the Holy    Prophet) that Abu Bakr brought three persons, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon    him) brought ten persons (as guests to their respective houses).

He    (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he also said: My wife and one servant who was    common between our house and that of Abu Bakr.

His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! have you    not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them.    but they refused to eat until you came. He (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid    myself. He (Abu Bakr) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the    guests: Eat, though it may not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He    (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did not take a morsel when from beneath that (there    appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, and lo! it was more than what it was    before. Abu Bakr saw that and found that it was so or more than that. He said to his wife:    Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. it is in excess    by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr ate saying: That was from the Satan    (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it    (the rest) to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and it was kept there until    morning, and during (those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people,    and the period of covenant was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every    person amongst them.

I said to them: He (&#8216;Abd Bakr) is a stern person, and if you would not do that (if    you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my    father) came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the peopleof    the household) said: We have not served them sofar.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 22: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Sacrifices (Kitab Al-Adahi)  </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Religion, at its highest and best, is the devotion of the  total self, through service and adoration, to the Almighty Who controls the universe. In  this sense all the manifold rites, consecrations, and purifications, offerings and sacred  feasts, all the working of asceticism and morality are only the indirect expression of the  inner experience of religion-the experience of trust, surrender, yearning and enthusiasm.  Sacrifice, whether that of wealth or desires, is the practical proof of man&#8217;s devotion to  his Creator. It is in fact religion in action. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an expresses this attitude of mind and heart  in the following words:&#8221; Say: Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, and my  living and my dying are for God (alone), the Sustainer of all the worlds, in Whose  Divinity none has a share. Thus I have been bidden-and I am foremost among those who  surrender themselves unto Him&#8221; (vi. 162-163). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The &#8216;Id al-Adha is commemorative of that unparalleled act  of devotion of that noble soul. Abraham (peace be upon him), who, in obedience to the  Command of his Lord, readily offered the life of his son Isma&#8217;il. The Holy Qur&#8217;an narrates  this soul- stirring event in these words:&#8221; And when he (Isma&#8217;il) attained the age to  assist him in his (Abrahm&#8217;s) work, he (Abraham) said: O my son! I see in vision that I  offer thee in sacrifice. Now see what is thy view. The son said: O my father, do as thou  art commanded. Thou wilt find me, if God so wills, patient. So when they both had  surrendered themselves to (Allah), and he laid him down prostrate on his forehead (for  sacrifice), We called out to him: O Abraham, thou hast indeed fulfilled the vision. Thus  do We reward the doers of good. Surely this is a manifest trial. And We ransom- ed him  with a great sacrifice. And We left (this blessing) for him among the later generations.  Peace be upon Abraham I Thus indeed do We reward those who do good; for he was one of Our  believing servants&#8221; (xxxvii. 102-111) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the above-quoted verses &#8216;axim (great), the adjective  qualifying&#8221; Sacrifice.&#8221; may be understood both in literal and figurative sense.  In literal sense it implies that a big ram was substituted. The figurative sense is even  more important. It was indeed a great and momentous occasion, when two men with  concentrated will ranged themselves in ranks of those to whom self-sacrifice in the  service of God was the supreme thing in life. Similarly, the words&#8221; thou hast indeed  fulfilled the vision&#8221; show that it was not in fact the act of slaughtering which was  needed for the fulfilment of the vision, but it was the attitude of submission and  surrender, an attitude of preparedness to sacrifice one&#8217;s all in the path of Allah. that  was demanded of Abraham and his illustrious son, and they eminently stood this test. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Readiness to Sacrifice One&#8217;s Life. In Islam the act of  sacrifice is the symbol of a Muslim&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, and to sacrifice all  his interests and desires in the cause of truth. The purpose of sacrifice is not fulfilled  only by shedding the blood of an animal, but it is really fulfilled when a man submits  himself completely to the command of Allah. This has been clearly laid down in Sura Hajj,  verse 37;&#8221; Not their flesh, nor their blood reaches Allah, but it is the piety from  you that reaches Him.&#8221; This verse eloquently speaks of the fact that sacrifice in  Islam is nothing else than a natural expression of homage and gratitude to the Creator. It  is the spirit of willing devotion and cheerful obedience underlying sacrifices that is  accepted by Allah Who is the Fountainhead of all morality. It is only piety of heart.  nobility of soul and righteousness of conduct, that is acceptable to Him. It is  essentially symbolic, an external symbol of dedication, devotion to Allah. Tafsir Ibn  Kathir stresses this point:&#8221; The man who offers sacrifice should keep this fact  uppermost in his mind that the most important motive behind this is the willing submission  to Allah&#8221; &#8216; (Vol. VI, p. 183). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such truths, so self-evident to the Muslim readers, needed  a clear and emphatic enunciation in view of the horrible misconceptions which had crowded  round the act of sacrifice before Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Throughout the Semitic field,&#8221; observes  Robertson Smith, in his well known book. The Religion of the Semitics, the fundamental  idea of sacrifice was that of communion between the God and his worshipper by joint  participation in the living flesh and blood of a sacred victim&#8221; (p. 49). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The Greeks also looked upon sacrifice as a  &#8216;Communion feast&#8217; with the Divinity, in which the God and his people became of one flesh  by partaking together of the flesh of the victim; the animal was regarded, as in some  degree, divine, as having the divine spirit incarnate in it. Among the Babylonians the  gods feast in heaven, they eat the offerings, they scent the savour, like flies do they  gather themselves together with the offerers&#8221; (Hastings, Encyclopedia of Rdigion  &amp; Ethics, Article&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an strikes at the very root of such wrong  concepts of sacrifice and asserts that&#8221; it is neither the flesh nor the blood of  (animals) that reaches Allah, but it is your piety that reaches Him,&#8221; for God does  not stand In need of food or blood. What He, in fact, desires is the devotion and piety of  our hearts. and, as a symbol of such offer, the visible institution of sacrifice has been  instituted. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has further elucidated the main parpose of the institution of  sacrifice.&#8221; For every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice) that they might  celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals (fit for food).  But your God is One God. Sub- mit then your wills to him (in Islam)&#8230;. The sacrificial  camels We have made for you as among the symbols from God. In them is (much) good for you  So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then when they fall down on their  sides, eat of them, feed the contented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them  subservient to you that you may be grateful&#8221; (xxii. 34-38). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;an testifies to the historical fact that whatever  may be the outward symbols of sacrifice, it has been accepted in one form or another by  all the nations of the world. It had been a fundamental element of both Jewish and Gentile  religions, and Christianity. It had been corrupted by many wrong practices and been  overlaid by many wrong notions before the advent of Islam. Islam purifies it from all  wrong notions and practices connected with it, and makes it explicitly clear that the act  of sacrifice is an outward symbol of man&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, if required,  and to surrender all his interests in the cause of truth and righteousness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The words&#8221; We have made them (subservient) to  you&#8221; have a very wide significance. A Muslim has been awakened to the realisation of  the fact that if they offer as a sacrifice an animal over which they hold control, it is  their bounden duty to lay down their lives in the way of Allah, Who is not only their  Master, but also their Creator and Sustainer and Who. therefore, exercises a far greater  authority over them than they do over the animals. This should be the true motive of  sacrifice, and it is with this spirit that this act should be performed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;anic words&#8221; To Him is acceptable observance of  duty on your part&#8221; make it abundantly clear that the prevalent idea of atonement  that&#8221; it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul&#8221; (Leviticus; 17: 11)  has no foundation in Islam. The expiation of sin in Islam rests entirely on the good deeds  of men, repentance of the Winners and the Forgiving and Merciful nature of God &#8216;This fact  cuts the ground from under the feet of any theory of an atoning sacrifice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The opening verse&#8221; For every people did We appoint  rites (of sacrifice) that they might celebrate the name of God over the beast cattle  wherewith He bath provided them,&#8221; speaks of the fact that the very idea of human  sacrifice is repugnant to the true religion and Allah has never given it sanction. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This practice of human sacrifice was not uncommon before  Islam.&#8221; Both on the mainland of Greece and in the Greek colonies human sacrifice was  practised, usually as a means towards expulsion of evil&#8221; (Encydopaedia Britannica,  Article&#8217;on&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). it occupied a prominent place in the ritual of the  mother goddesses of ancient times. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The ordinary form of sacrifice,&#8221; says E. O.  James, in his famous book, The origins of Sacrifice,&#8221; consisted in stripping the  victim of his ornaments, stretching him over the convex sacrificial stones and while fare  priests held his arms, legs, head, the high priests or sacrificer cut open his breast with  a flint or obsidian knife, and tore out the heart. This was held up to the sun to provide  it with nourishment, before it was cast into a basin of Copal placed in a position to  enable the blood and incense to ascend to the gods. The body was hurled down the steps of  the temple to the court where it was seized by the priest or by the warrior who captured  the victim. Some times a solemn feast was then held on the flesh, the skin having first  been removed to be worn ceremonially by men who seem to have acquired thereby the  fertilising nd health-giving qualities of the victim. Some of the blood was carried to  certain temples and smeared on the hips of the images of gods&#8221; (pp. 84-6). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has not only exterminated the very idea of human  sacrifice, but has completely ended all such inhuman practices which were very common with  the people before Islam. The Holy Qur&#8217;an makes a pointed reference to the fact that this  sacrifice of animals is commemorative of Abraham&#8217;s offer of his son&#8217;s life at the Command  of Allah, who was substituted by a ram, and it has been perpetuated by Islam. It is  narrated that once the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) asked him  about the sacrifice. He replied:&#8221; This is commemorative Sunnah of your father  Abraham&#8221; (vide Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, p. 221). That this practice of sacrifice was  already prevalent amongst the people before Islam can be well borne out by the fact that  we find clear references to it in the poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The well. known poet  Umayya observes: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abraham was one who would fulfil the pledges and offer  sacrifices for Allah&#8217;s sake. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thus he offered the life of his only son whose separation  and whose risk of life, he could not bear. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said,&#8221; O my son I have pledged you to Allah. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>May I sacrifice my life for you! </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Be steadfast and firm.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He had hardly taken off the shirt of his son, when Allah  substituted Isma&#8217;il by a stout ram. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not only this practice of sacrifice has been preserved in  Islam, but even the way of Abraham&#8217;s has been declared to he one of righteousness and  truthfulness: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Say: Behold, my Lord has guided me to a way that is  straight-a religion of Right Path-the Path (trodden) by Abraham, who was wholly devoted to  God, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to any beside him&#8221; (vi. 161). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Even the Millat has been assigned a name after the name of  Abraham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; He hath selected you and hath not placed upon you  any hardship in religion-the religion of your father, Abraham. He named you Muslims before  this, and in this, that the Messenger may be a witness to you and you may he witnesses to  mankind&#8221; (xxii. 78). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Historical Continuity, The constant reference to the  earlier Prophets and the Qur&#8217;anic testimony to their righteousness and the preservation of  some of their religious practices have been done to awaken the people to the realisation  of a fundamental fact, i. e. the fact of the historical continuity of religious  experience. The Muslims have been asked to believe in that which has been revealed unto  Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as well as in that which was revealed before him.  Life-so the Qur&#8217;an teaches us-is not a series of disconnected parts but a continuous,  organic process: and this law applies also to the law of the mind, of which man&#8217;s  religious experience (in its cumulative sense) is a part. To make religious experience  more living, to set Allah the Ever-living with loving vividness before the eyes of living  men, to make them feel Him as actually and eternally present in their lives, man needs a  path, clear-cut path, lightened with glories of the Messengers of Allah-a path on which  one should not feel lonely but the strength of comradeship of those noble souls upon whom  Allah has bestowed His choicest blessings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A few words may be said about the way how an animal should  be slaughtered according to the teachings of Islam. Three are the aims which should be  kept before the mind while slaughtering the animal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered by reciting the name of Allah and  glorifying Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered with a sharp knife so that its  jugular vein may be cut with the minimum possible pain and its skin should not be removed  and limbs should not be cut so long as there is any sign of life in it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The head should not be removed from the body abruptly but  only the jugular vein should be cut so that even the last drop of blood flows out of its  body. If the animal is beheaded with a stroke, the blood congeals in its veins which makes  the flesh distasteful and pernicious to health. </font></p>

He permitted him    to do so. He (the narrator) said: I do not know whether this permission was granted to    anyone else besides him or not. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then turned    towards two rams. and he slaughtered them, and the people&#8217; came to the goats and got them    distributed amongst themselves (for offering them as sacrifice).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi b. Hatim reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, I set    off trained dogs and they catch for me (the game) and I recite the came of Allah over it    (I slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you    set off your trained dogs and you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then    eat (the game). I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy    Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did    not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I    throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game).    Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly    (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.</font></p>

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: When you set of your trained dogs    having recited the name of Allah, then eat what these (hounds) have caught for you, oven    if it (the game) is killed, provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part of the    game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don&#8217;t eat it as I fear that it might have    caught for its own self. And do not eat in case other dogs have joined your trained dogs.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi b. Hatim reported that he asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting) with the help of an arrow having a stub end. He    said: If it strikes (the game) with its point, then eat, but if it strikes flatly and it    dies, that is Waqidh (beaten into death), do not eat that. I asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said. When you    send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if some    part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that    (the-game) for itself. I (again) said: If I find along with my dog another dog, and do not    know which of (the dogs) has caught (the game). then (what should I do)? Thereupon he    (&#8216;Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Then don&#8217;t eat that, for you recited the name of Allah on your    dog and not on the other one.</font></p>

And he found for us nothing    besides it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday). I (Abu Zubair, one of the    narrators) said: What did you do with that? He said: We sucked that just as a baby sucks    and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We beat off    leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then    went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something    like a big mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-&#8216;Anbar    (spermaceti whale). Abu &#8216;Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not    matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path    of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.    We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said:    I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and    sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaida called    forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold    of one of the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the    camels we had with us and it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves    with pieces of boiled meat (especially for use in our journey). When we came back to    Medina, we went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to    him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you.

So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger    that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detachment of the    Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-&#8216;Anbar (whale). We ate of    that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became    stout. Abu &#8216;Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance    at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over    that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its    eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small    bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). &#8216;Ubaida gave every person    amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of    us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Yazid b. al-Asamm reported: A newly wedded person of Medina    invited us to a wedding feast, and he served us thirteen lizards. There were those who ate    it and those who abandoned it. I met Ibn &#8216;Abbas the next day, and informed him (about    this) in the presence of many persons. Some of them said that the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) had observed: I neither eat it nor forbid (anyone) from eating it, nor    declare it to be unlawful. Thereupon Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: Sad it is what you say! Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him) has not been sent, but (to declare in clear words) the    lawful and the unlawful (things). We were once with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be. upon    him) as he was with Maimuna, and there were with him al-Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas, Khalid b. Walid    and some women (also) when a tray of food containing flesh was presented to him. As    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was about to eat that, Maimuna said: It is the    flesh of the lizard. He withdrew his hand saying: That is the flesh which I never eat; but    he said to them (those who were present there): You may eat. Al-Fadl ate out of that, so    did Khalid b Walid, and the women. Maimuna (however) said: I do not eat anything but that    which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eats.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 20: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Government (Kitab Al-Imara)  </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is a social religion, not in the sense that it is  through society alone that religion breathes its sacred spirit in the individuals, but in  the sense that it aims at inculcating God-consciousness both in individual and society.  Jesus said: The Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Islam fully subscribes to this view,  since no just kingdom can be founded on earth by unjust men, who have not first created  the Kingdom of Heaven in their hearts, but Islam goes a step forward and says that the  creation of the Kingdom of Heaven within heart is not enough; this Kingdom of Heaven  within must be externalised into a Kingdom of Heaven on earth, so that the organised life  of man may be built up on the basis of love, fraternity and justice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It thus becomes clear that the Islamic State is not an end  in itself, but a means to an end, the end being the development of a community of people  who stand up for equity and justice, for right against wrong or, to phrase it differently,  for the creation of such conditions as would enable the greatest possible number of human  beings to live spiritually, morally and physically in accordance with the teachings of  Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thus the founding of an Islamic State is not a sort  of&#8221; worldly activity,&#8221; something undesirable, as some people wrongly suppose,  but the sine qua non of social justice, as demanded by Islam.&#8221; The state,&#8221; says  Dr lqbal,&#8221; from the Islamic standpoint, is an endeavour to transform these ideal  principles into space-time forces, an aspiration to realize them in a definite human  organization. It is in this sense alone that state in Islam is a theocracy, not in the  sense that it is headed by a representative of God on earth who can always screen his  despotic will behind his supposed infallibility. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As this State is meant to enforce the law of the Shari&#8217;ah  within its territorial jurisdiction, it is duty bound to make itself an efficient organ  for transforming the high ideals of Islam into reality. The Qur&#8217;an, while enumerating the  main functions of the Islamic State, says:&#8221; Those who, if We establish them in the  land, observe worship, and pay the poor-due and enjoin good and forbid evil&#8221; (xxii.  41). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This shows that the function of an Islamic State is not  only to defend its citizens from external attack and internal disorder, but also to enable  individual man and woman to realise the tenets of Islam and their beliefs. in the  socioeconomic concerts of their practical life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So far as the nature of the Islamic State is concerned, it  is theocracy with regard to God in the sense that the de jure sovereignty belongs to Allah  Whose de facto sovereignty is inherent and manifest in the working of the entire universe  and Who enjoys exclusively the sovereign prerogative over all the creation. The Holy  Qur&#8217;an has stressed this point in so many verses: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The Command is for none but for Allah: He has  commanded that ye obey </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>none but Him: that is the right path&#8221; (xii. 40). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Follow the revelation sent unto you from your Lord,  and do not follow the (so-called) guardians other than Him&#8221; (vii. 3). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; And those who do not make their decisions in  accordance with that revealed by Allah are (in fact) the deniers of Truth&#8221; (v. 44).  It thus becomes quite clear that a State established on the basis of God&#8217;s sovereignty  cannot enforce any law in contravention of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah even if all the  citizens make a demand for it. An Islamic State is, therefore, theocratic in one aspect as  it is run according to God-given laws, but it is altogether a differmt theocracy of which  Europe has had the bitter experience and in which, a priestly clan is sharply marked off  from the rest of the population and exercises an unchecked domination and enforces laws of  its own making in the name of God, and thus imposes its own godhood upon the common  people. The priest puts himself as a mediator between the masses and the unseen God. Such  a system is quite un-Islamic. The theocracy built by Islam is not ruled by a particular  religious class, but by the whole community of Muslims including the rank and file. as  Allah has not appointed a particular individual, group, race or class as the  representative of the Real Sovereign upon the earth, but the whole community. The Qur&#8217;an  says:&#8221; Allah has promised to those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that  He will assuredly make them to succeed (the present) rulers and grant them vicegerency in  the land just as He made those before them to succeed (others)&#8221; (ixiv. 55). This  verse makes it clear that all believers have been conferred upon the Caliphate and not a  special class or dynasty. Moreover, the Caliphate granted by Allah to the faithful is the  popular vicegerency and not a limited one and thus it is run with the consent of the  people. The concepts of the Divine Right of Kingship and the infallibility of clergy are  alien to the spirit of Islam. Every Muslim stands on equal level with the other Muslim as  the vicegerent of the Lord upon the earth. None of them, therefore, enjoys any preference  to the other by virtue of high birth or belonging to a special religious group. History is  teplete with instances of Caliphs being brought to the court and publicly criticised by  ordinary men and women. Even a lowliest villager could dare tell the Commander of the  Faithful that he would set him straight like a spindle if he deviates an inch from the  poth of righteousness. This shows that the rulers and the officials in the Islamic State  are answerable both to God and man for their actions, and the people have every right to  criticise. not only their public behaviour, but even their private activities. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the context of such heavy responsibilities the heading  of the Islamic State or assumption of any other important portfolio in its set-up is a  very difficult job so much so that that Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) compared it  to the slaughtering of one with a blunt knife. No person, therefore. who is conscious of  the responsibilities of the job, covets to assume that; he rather shirks it and accepts it  only when he is compelled to do so. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) declared that  person to be quite unfit for office in an Islamic State who is covetous of it, as he is  either ignorant of its grave responsibilities or desires to take undue advantage of his  official power. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We enumerate below some of the important rights and duties  of an Islamic State. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As for the rights, the Islamic State can claim full loyalty  from all its citizen wholehearted cooperation in all sectors of life and complete  obedience to the law of the land and the commands of the rulers so long as they are in  comformity with the Laws of the Shari&#8217;ah. But where the rulers transgress the limits of  the citizens have the right, not only to withdraw co-operation, but also to check the  rulers from acting against the Commands of Aliah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The citizens are also required to pay taxes due to the  State quite willingly and not to misappropriate its funds, and to participate in Jihad in  any capacity for which they are deemed fit by the authorities of the Islamic State. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So far as the duties of the Islamic State are concerned,  the first and foremost duty is to protect the life, property and honour of every citizen,  irrespective of his caste, creed, colour, religion or social status. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Moreover, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to  protect the freedom and individual liberty of every citizen so long as there is no valid  reason to curtail it. It cannot be done as an arbitrary act. The State is authorised to  lay hands upon it through due process of law. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Again, freedom of expression is one of the fundamental  rights of the citizen which an Islamic State must respect. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to see that  no citizen remains unprovided for in respect of the basic necessities of life, viz, food,  othing, shelter, medical aid and education, for the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him)  said:&#8221; The government is the guardian of those who have no guardian.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Moreover, the State is bound to create such conditions in  which the good reigns supreme in the society and evil is suppressed and exterminated, and  its citizens learn to live as good Muslims. </font></p>

People praised him and said:    May God give you a noble recompense! He said: I am hopeful (of God&#8217;s mercy) as well as    afraid (of His wrath) People said: Appoint anyone as your successor. He said: Should I    carry the burden of conducting your affairs in my life as well as in my death? (So far as    Caliphate is concerned) I wish I could acquit myself (before the Almighty) in a way that    there is neither anything to my credit nor anything to my discredit. If I would appoint my    successor, (I would because) one better than me did so. (He meant Abu Bakr.) If I would    leave You alone, (I would do so because) one better than me, i. e. the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him), did so. &#8216;Abdullah says: When he mentioned the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) I understood that he would not appoint anyone as Caliph.</font></p>

The narrator said: I took an oath that I will    talk to him about the matter. I kept quiet until the next morning, still I did not talk to    him, and I felt as if I were carryint, a mountain on my right hand. At last I came to him    and entered his apartment. (Seeing me) he began to ask me about the condition of the    people, and I informed him (about them). Then I said to him: I heard something from the    people and took an oath that I will communicate it to you. They presume that you are not    going to nominate a successor. If a grazer of camels and sheep that you had appointed    comes back to you leaving the cattle, you will (certainly) think that the cattle are lost.    To look after the people is more serious and grave. (The dying Caliph) was moved at my    words. He bent his head in a thoughtful mood for some time and raised it to me and said:    God will doubtlessly protect His religion. If I do not nominate a successor (I have a    precedent before me), for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not nominate    his successor. And if I nominate one (I have a precedent), for Abu Bakr did nominate. The    narrator (Ibn Umar) said: By God. when he mentioned the Messenger of Allah (may peace be    upon him) and Abu Bakr, I (at once) understood that he would not place anyone at a par    with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and would not nominate anyone.</font></p>

Both of them    made a request for a position (of authority) while the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon    him) was brushing his teeth with a tooth-stick. He said (to me): Abu Musa (or &#8216;Abdullah b.    Qais), what do you say (about the request they have made)? I said: By God Who sent thee on    thy mission with truth, they did not disclose to me what they had in their minds, and I    did not know that they would ask for a position. The narrator says (while recalling this    hadith): I visualise as if I were looking at the miswak of the Holy Prophet (may peace be    upon him) between his lips. He (the Holy Prophet) said: We shall not or shall never    appoint to the public offices (in our State) those who with to have them, but you may go,    Abu Musa (or Abdullah b. Qais) (to take up your assignment). He sent him to Yemen as    governor. then he sent Mu&#8217;adh b. jabal in his wake (to help him in the discharge of    duties). When Mu&#8217;adh reached the camp of Abu Musa, the latter (received him and) said:    Please get yourself down; and he spread for him a mattress, while there was a man bound    hand and foot as a prisoner. Mu&#8217;adh said: Who is this? Abu Musa said: He was a Jew. He    embraced Islam. Then he reverted to his false religion and became a Jew. Mu&#8217;adh said: I    won&#8217;t sit until he is killed according to the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace    be upon him) (in this case). Abu Musa said: Be seated. It will be done. He said: I won&#8217;t    sit unless he is killed in accordance with the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace    be upon him). He repeated these words thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered him (to be killed) and    he was kilied. Then the two talked of standing in prayer at night. One of them, i. e.    Mu&#8217;adh, said: I sleep (for a part of the night) and stand in prayer (for a part) and I    hope that I shall get the same reward for steeping as I shall get for standing (in    prayer).</font></p>

Then he raised his hands    so that we could see the whiteness of his armpits. Then he said twice: O God, I have    conveyed (Thy Commandments).</font></p>

He came with the collectio, gave it to the Holy Prophet (may    peace be upon him). and said: This wealth is for you and this is a gift presented to me.    The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to him: Why didn&#8217;t you remain in the house    of your father and your mother to see whether gifts were presented to you or not. Then he    stood up to deliver a sermon. Here follows the tradition like the tradition of Sufyan.</font></p>

When he came (back), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked him to    render his account. He said: This wealth is for you (i. e. for the public treasury) and    this is a gift (presented to me). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: You    should have remained in the house of your father and your mother, until your gift came to    you if you spoke the truth; then he addressed us. He praised God and extolled Him, and    afterwards said: I appoint a man from you to a responsible post sharing with the authority    that God has entrusted to me, and he comes to me saying: This wealth is for you (i. e. for    the public treasury) and this is a gift presented to me. Why did he not remain in the    house of his father and his mother and his gift came to him, if he was truthful? By God,    any one of you will not take anything from (the public funds) without any justification,    but will meet his Lord carrying it on himself on the Day of judgment. I will recognise any    one of you meeting Allah and carrying a growling camel, or a cow bellowing or a goat    bleating. Then he raised his hands so high that whiteness of his armpits could be seen.    Then he said: O my Lord, I have conveyed (Thy Commandments). The narrator says: My eyes    saw (the Holy Prophet standing in that pose) and my ears heard (what he said).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b.    Abd Rabb al-Ka&#8217;ba who said: I entered the mosque when &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;As was    sitting in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba and the people had gathered around him. I betook myself    to them and sat near him. (Now) Abdullah said: I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) on a journey. We halted at a place. Some of us began to set right their    tents, others began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began to graze    their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)    announced that the people should gather together for prayer, so we gathered around the    Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: It was the duty of every Prophet that    has gone before me to guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and warn them    against what he knew was bad for them; but this Umma of yours has its days of peace and    (security) in the beginning of its career, and in the last phase of its existence it will    be afflicted with trials and with things disagreeable to you. (In this phase of the Umma),    there will be tremendous trials one after the other, each making the previous one dwindle    into insignificance. When they would be afflicted with a trial, the believer would say:    This is going to bring about my destruction. When at (the trial) is over, they would be    afflicted with another trial, and the believer would say: This surely is going to be my    end. Whoever wishes to be delivered from the fire and enter the garden should die with    faith in Allah and the Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by    them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the piedge of his hand and the    sincerity of his heart (i. e. submit to him both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should    obey him to the best of his capacity. It another man comes forward (as a claimant to    Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the Muslims) should behead the latter. The    narrator says: I came close to him (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;As) and said to him: Can you    say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? He    pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind    retained it. I said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu&#8217;awiya, orders us to unjustly consume    our wealth among ourselves and to kill one another, while Allah says:&#8221; O ye who    believe, do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on    mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves. Verily, God is Merciful to you&#8221; (iv.    29). The narrator says that (hearing this) Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-As kept quiet for a    while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to God; and diqobey him in    matters involving disobedience to God.</font></p>

One who sees through    their bad deeds (and tries to prevent their repetition by his band or through his speech),    is absolved from blame, but one who hates their bad deeds (in the heart of his heart,    being unable to prevent their recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) fafe ( so    far as God&#8217;s wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates    them is spiritually ruined. People asked (the Holy Prophet): Shouldn&#8217;t we fight against    them?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife    of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). She said: When the believing women migrated    (to Medina) and came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), they would be    tested in accordance with the following words of Allah. the Almighty and Exalted:&#8221; O    Prophet, when believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they    will not associate in worship anything with God, that they will not steal. that, they will    not commit adultery&#8230;&#8221; to the end of the verse (lx. 62).</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whoso from the believing women accepted these conditions    and agreed to abide by them were considered to have offered themselves for swearing    fealty. When they had (formally) declared their resolve to do so, the Messenger of Allah    (may peace he upon him) would say to them: You may go. I have confirmed your fealty. By    God, the hand of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) never touched the hand of    a woman. He would take the oath of fealty from them by oral declaration. By God, the    Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) never took any vow from women except that which    God had ordered him to take, and his palm never touched the palm of a woman. When he had    taken their vow, he would tell them that he had taken the oath from them orally.</font></p>

When the question    was asked for the third time, he said: One who goes out for Jibad is like a person who    keeps fasts, stands in prayer (constantly), (obeying) Allah&#8217;s (behests contained in) the    verses (of the Qur&#8217;an), and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and prayer until the    Mujihid returns from Jihad in the way of Allah, the Exalted.</font></p>

Bashir    who said: As I was (sitting) near the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon    him), a man said: I do not care if, after embracing Islam, I do not do any good deed    (except) distributing drinking water among the pilgrims. Another said: I do not care if,    after embracing Islam, I do not do any good deed beyond maintenance service to the Sacred    Mosque. Another said: Jihad in the way of Allah is better than what you have said. &#8216;Umar    reprimanded them and said: Don&#8217;t raise your voices near the pulpit of the Messenger of    Allah (may peace be upon him) on Friday. When prayer was over, I entered (the apartment of    the Holy Prophet) and asked his verdict about the matter in which they had differed. (It    was upon this that) Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, revealed the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; Do    you make the giving of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred    Mosque equal to (the service of those) who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive    hard in the cause of Allah. They are not equal in the sight of God. And Allah guides not    the wrongdoing people&#8221; (ix. 20). This tradition has been narrated on the authority of    Nu&#8217;man b.

He said: Some people from my Umma were    presented to me who were fighters in the way of Allah and were sailing in this sea.    (Gliding smoothly on the water), they appeared to be kings or like kings (sitting) on    thrones (the narrator has a doubt about the actual expression used by the Holy Prophet).    She said: Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah that He may include me among these warriors.    He prayed for her. Then he placed his head (down) and dozed off (again). He woke up    laughing, as before. (She said) I said: Messenger of Allah, what makes you laugh? He    replied: A people from my Umma were presented to me. They were fighters in Allah&#8217;s way.    (He described them in the same words as he had described the first warriors.) She said:    Messenger of Allah, pray to God that He may include me among these warriors.

They will be worse than the people of pre-Islamic days. They    will get whatever they ask of Allah. While we were yet sitting when &#8216;Uqba b. &#8216;Amir came,    and Maslama said to him: &#8216;Uqba, listen to what &#8216;Abdullah says. &#8216;Uqba said: He knows    better; so far as I am concerned, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)    say: A group of people from my Umma will continue to fight in obedience to the Command of    Allah, remaining dominant over their enemies. Those who will oppose them shall not do them    any harm. They will remain ill this condition until the Hour overtakes them. (At this)    &#8216;Abdullah said: Yes. Then Allah will raise a wild which will be fragrant like musk and    whose touch will be like the touch of silk; (but) it will cause the death of all    (faithful) persons, not leaving behind a single person with an iota of faith in his heart.    Then only the worst of men will remain to be overwhelmed by the Hour.</font></p>

<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Jihad and Expedition (Kitab Al-Jihad wa&#8217;l-Siyar) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The word Jihad is derived from the verb jahada which means:&#8221; he exerted himself&#8221;. Thus literally, Jihad means exertion, striving; but in juridico-religious sense, it signifies the exertion of one&#8217;s power to the utmost of one&#8217;s capacity in the cause of Allah. This is why the word Jihad has been used as the antonym to the word Qu, ud (sitting) in the Holy Qur&#8217;an (iv. 95). Thus Jihad in Islam is not an act of violence directed indiscriminately against the non-Muslims; it is the name given to an all-round struggle which a Muslim should launch against evil in whatever form or shape it appears. Qital fi sabilillah (fighting in the way of Allah) is only one aspect of Jihad. Even this qital in Islam is not an act of mad brutality. It has its material and moral functions, i. e. self-preservation and the preservation of the moral order in the world. The verdict of all religious and ethical philosophies-ancient and modern-justify war on moral grounds. When one nation is assailted by the ambitions and cupidity of another, the doctrine of non-resistance is anti-social, as it involves non-assertion, not only of one&#8217;s own rights, but of those of others who need protection against the forces of tyranny and oppression. A Muslim is saddled with the responsibilities to protect himself and all those who seek his protection. He cannot afford to abandon the defenceless people, old man, women and children to privation, suffering and moral peril. Fighting in Islam, therefore, represents in Islamic Law what is known among Western jurists as&#8221; just war&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The very first revelation in which the permission to wage war against the forces of evil sums up the aims and objects of qital in Islam: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Permitted&#8217;are those who are fought against, because they have been oppressed. and verily God is more Powerful for their aid. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: &#8216;Our Lord is Allah, &#8216; for had it not been for &#8216;Allah&#8217;s repelling someone by means of others, cloisters and churches and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft-mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helps one who helps Him. Lo! Allah is Strong. Almighty&#8221; (xxii. 39. 41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>These verses eloquently speak of &#8216;the fact that it is neither for the acquisition of territory nor for the love of power and distinction that the Muslims have been permitted to raise arms against the enemy. They were allowed to do so because their very existence had been made difficult by the high-handedness of the Meccans. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has elucidated this point in the following verse: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah and for the oppressed among men and women and children who say: Our Lord! take us forth from the town whereof the people are oppressors and grant us from Thee a friend and grant us from Thee a helper&#8221; (iv. 75). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The war in Islam is waged with a view to securing liberty and freedom for those who are groaning under the oppression of heartless tyrants. It is the bounden duty of the Muslims to alleviate their sufferings and create for them an atmosphere of peace and security. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then in the succeeding verse a distinction is also drawn between two types of war: one which is fought for the sake of Allah and the other which is waged for evil ends: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of devil. So fight against the friends of Satan; verily weak indeed is the strategy of the devil&#8221; (iv. 76). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been made clear that those people who fight for self-glorification or for the exploitation of the weak are in fact friends of the devil; wheres those who raise arms to curb tyranny and aggression, to eradicate evil from the human society, fight in the way of Allah. Mere fighting is not, therefore, Jihad in Islam; it is the noble objective alone which makes it a sacred pursuit like devotion and prayer. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari that once a man went to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: One man fights for the sake of spoils of war, the second one fights for fame and glory and the third to display his courage and skill; which among them is the fighter for the cause of Allah? Upon this the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) replied: He who fights with the sole objective that the word of Allah should become supreme is a Mujahid in the cause of the Lord. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A Mujahid is thus a noble person who offers his life for the achievement of lofty ends. He is actuated by human considerations lifts arms not under the impulse of fury and revenge, but with will, fore-thought, tenacity and fellow-feeling, and his conduct bears the imprint of human intellect, human sympathy and sense of justice. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has explained this point in Sura Anfal in these words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; O you who believe, when you meet an enemy, be firm, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful. And obey Allah and His Apostle. And fall with no disputes, lest ye falter and your strength fail; but be steadfast! For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully. And to be seen of men and debar (men) from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do&#8221; (viii. 45-46). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Here the Muslims have been exhorted to observe five principles of war: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be steadfast in the face of the enemy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have full reliance on the help of Allah and remember Him much. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have the unity of purpose and solidarity of corporate life always before your eyes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be fully aware of the lofty purpose before you in fighting. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Don&#8217;t be proud and boastful in your attitude and behaviour. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam has purified even war of all its cruelty and horrors and has made it a&#8221; reformative process&#8221; to deal with evil. The Holy Qur&#8217;an bserves: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you and transgress not the limits. Verily Allah loves not the transgressors&#8221; (ii. 190). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has given clear instructions about the behaviour of the Muslim army. He observed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Set out for Jihad in the name of Allah and for the sake of Allah. Do not lay hands on the old verging on death, on women, children and babes. Do not steal anything from the booty and collect together all that falls to your lot in the battlefield and do good, for Allah loves the virtuous and the pious.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So great is the respect for humanly feelings in Islam that even the wanton destruction of enemy&#8217;s crops or property is strictly forbidden. The righteous Caliphs followed closely the teachings of Allah and those of His Apostle in letter and spirit the celebrated address which the first Caliph Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) gave to his army while sending her on the expedition to the Syrian borders is permeated with the noble spirit with which the war in Islam is permitted. He said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not ary of the enemy&#8217;s flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monast ic services; leave them alone&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is said that once at the time of conquest, a singing girl was brought to al-Muhajir b. Abu Umayya who had been publicly singing satirical poems about Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muhajir got her hand amputated. When the Caliph heard this news, he was shocked and wrote a letter to Muhajir in the following words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; I have learnt that you laid hands on a woman who had hurled abuses on me, and, therefore, got her hand amputated. God has not sought vengeance even in the case of polytheism, which is a great crime. He has not permitted mutilation even with regard to manifest infidelity. Try to be considerate and sympathetic in your attitude towards others in future. Never mutilate, because it is a grave offence. God purified Islam and the Muslims from rashness and excessive wrath. You are well aware of the fact that those enemies fell into the hands of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who had been recklessly abusing him; who had turned him out of his home; and who fought against him, but he never permitted their mutilation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another letter written by hadrat &#8216;Umar the Second Caliph, which is addressed to sa&#8217;d b. Abu Waqqas, speaks eloquently of the noble spirit with which the Muslims have bear exhorted to take up arms: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Always search your minds and hearts and stress upon your men the need of perfect integrity and sincerity in the cause of Allah. There should be no material end before them in laying down their lives. but they abould deem it a means whereby they can please their Lord and entitle them. selves to His favour: such a spirit of selflessness should be inculcated in the minds of those who unfortunately lack it. Be firm in the thick of the battle as Allah helps man according to the perseverance that he shows in the cause of His faith and he would be rewarded in accordance with the spirit of sacrifice which he displays for the sake of the Lord. Be careful that those who have been entrusted to your care receive no harm at your hands and are never deprived of any of their legitimate rights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Such in fact is the humane and noble attitude which Islam exhorts its followers to adopt on the battlefield where passions are generally let loose. It is an attitude the like of which is not to be found in the history of any other nation. Has the world any code of military ethics more noble and compassionate than this?&#8221; The moral tone adopted by the Caliph Abu Bakr in his instructions to the Syrian army was,&#8221; says a Christian historian,&#8221; so unlike the principles of the Roman government that it must have commanded profound attention from the subject people-such a proclamation announced to Jews and Christians sentiments of justice and principles of toleration which neither Roman emperors nor orthodox bishops had ever adopted as the rule of conduct.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Western scholars have indulged in a good deal of mud-slinging on the question of the use of the sword in Islam. But if one were to reflect calmly on this point one would be convinced that the sword has not been used recklessly by the Muslims; it has been wielded purely with humane feelings in the wider interest of humanity. Utmost regard was always shown to human life, honour and property even on the battlefield. That is why in all the eighty-two encounters between the Muslims and the non-Muslims during the life of the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), only 1018 persons lost their lives on both sides. Out of this 259 were Muslims, whereas the remaining 759 belonged to the opposite camp. One wonders at the audacity of these writers only when one compares the religious wars of Charles the Great, in which 4300 pagan Saxons were killed in cold blood, when one recalls the&#8221; famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Albigensian war, quieted the scruples of a too conscientious general, &#8216;Kill all, God will know His own&#8217;&#8230;. When we recall the Spanish Inquisition, the conquest of Mexico and Peru, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the sack of Magdeburg by Tilly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is indeed strange that the criticism on the use of sword by Muslims emanates from those whose hands are soiled in the blood of countless innocent human beings, by those who exult in the techniques of homicide, who have depersonalised warfare to such an extent that millions of innocent men and women are put to death and numberless are thrown into concentration camps and flogged with steel rods and ox-hide whips, and all this is done without any qualm of conscience. As human beings. we hang our heads down in shame when we think of the horrifying atrocities which have been perpetrated by the modern civilised men. It is estimated that. in the First World War, ten million soldiers were killed and an equal number of civilians lost their lives, and twenty million died on account of widespread epidemics and famines throughout the world as an aftermath of this war. Economic costs are estimated at $ 338,000,000,000 of which $ 186,000,000,000 were direct costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The losses in the Second World War were staggeringly greater as compared to those in the first one. Twenty-two million persons were killed and thirty-four million were wounded. The estimated cost of the war was $ 1, 348. 000,000,000 of which $ 1, 167,000,000,000 consisted of direct military costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is significant that in the Korean War, the first instance in which an international organisation for establishing peace utilised military force to suppress aggression, more than one million persons were killed which added to the civilian deaths in Korea and totalled about five millions. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported from Sulaiman b. Buraid through his father that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai&#8217; except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&#8217;s help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah&#8217;s behest with regard to them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Qatada reported: We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (my peace be upon him) on an expedition in the year of the Battle of Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, (some of the Muslims turned back (in fear). I saw that a man from the polytheists overpowered one of the Muslims. I turned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has happened to the people (that they are retreating)? I said: It is the Decree of Allah. Then the people returned. (The battle ended in a victory for the Muslims) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat down (to distribute the spoils of war). He said: One who has killed an enemy and can bring evidence to prove it will get his belongings. So I stood up and said: Who will give evidence for me? Then I sat down. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said like this. I stood up (again) and said: Who will bear witness for me? He (the Holy Prophet) made the same observation the third time, and I stood up (once again). Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you, O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will not happen. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will not like to deprive one of the lions from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the armour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the street of Banu Salama. This was the first property I acquired after embracing Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In a version of the hadith narrated by Laith, the words uttered by Abu Bakr are:&#8221; No, never! He will not give it to a fox from the Quraish leaving aside a lion from the lions of Allah among&#8230;.&#8221; And the hadith is closed with the words:&#8221; The first property I acquired.&#8221;</span></p>

All of a sudden, he left us hurriedy, came to his camel, untethered it, made it kneel down, mounted it and urged the beast which ran off with him. A man on a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haunches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man&#8217;s baggage and weapons. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came forward to meet me and the people were with him. He asked: Who has killed the man? The people said: Ibn Akwa&#8217;.

I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) met me in the street and said: Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik b. Aus who said: Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa&#8217; came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. &#8216;Auf, Zubair and Sa&#8217;d (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa&#8217;) came again and said: What do you say about &#8216;Ali and Abbas (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by &#8216;Ali and Abbas). &#8216;Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and &#8216;Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger&#8221;. The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distrbuted among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and &#8216;All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed away, Abu Bakr said:&#8221; I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).&#8221; Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat &#8216;Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to &#8216;Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn&#8217;t it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.</span></p>

Zubair who narrated from A&#8217;isha that she informed him that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), sent someone to Abu Bakr to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; The household of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, &#8216;All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar). &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. &#8216;All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until the latter&#8217;s eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. So &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of &#8216;Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God&#8217;s forgiveness. Then &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his action was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably inclined to &#8216;Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.</span></p>

Abu Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, &#8216;Umar handed them over to &#8216;All and Abbas, but &#8216;Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned &#8216;Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to this day.</span></p>

The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) turned (his face) towards the Qibla Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord:&#8221; O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth.&#8221; He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said:. Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfil for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur&#8217;anic verse):&#8221; When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession.&#8221; So Allah helped him with angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Zumail said that the badith was narrated to him by Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him&#8217; the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizi&#8217;m! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What is your opinion. Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah. I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over &#8216;Aqil to &#8216;Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may but off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not approve what I said The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep ate, if not, I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse:&#8221; It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed&#8230;&#8221; to the end of the verse:&#8221; so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them.&#8221;</span></p>

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on &#8216;Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

They surrendered at the command of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but he referred the decision about them to Sa&#8217;d who said: I decide about them that those of them who can fight be killed, their women and children taken prisoners and their properties distributed (among the Muslims).</span></p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="019.4380"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:&#8221; In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects.&#8221; O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64].&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.</span></p>

He said: No, by Allah, The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not turn his back; (what actually happened was that) some young men from among his companions, who were hasty and who were either without any arms or did not have abundant arms, advanced and met a party of archers (who were so good shots) that their arrows never missed the mark. This party (of archers) belonged to Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir. They shot at the advancing young men and their arrows were not likely to miss their targets. So these young men turned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib was leading him. (At this) he got down from his mule, invoked God&#8217;s help, and called out: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib. Then he deplnved his men into battle array.</span></p>

I could not understand what he did, but (all of a sudden) I saw that a group of people appeared from the other hillock. They and the Companions of the Prophet (may peace be upon him) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (covering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders. My waist-wrapper got loose and I held the two mantles together. (In this downcast condition) I passed by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his white mule. He said: The son of Akwa&#8217; finds himself to be utterly perplexed. Wher. the Companions gathered round him from all sides. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got down from his mule. picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So they turned back fleeing. and Allah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed their booty among the Muslims.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated by &#8216;Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said: Many deputations came to Mu&#8217;awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka&#8217;ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa&#8217;, ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka&#8217;ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions: (i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way)&#8230;.

Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa&#8217;. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ascended the mount of as-Safa&#8217;. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.</span></p>

But write: Muhammad b. &#8216;Abdullah. So he told &#8216;Ali to strike out these words. &#8216;Ali said: No, by Allah, I will not strike them out. The Messenger of Allah (may Peace be upon him) said: Show me their place (on the parchment). So he (&#8216;Ali) showed him their place and he (the Holy Prophet) struck them out; and &#8216;Ali wrote: Ibn &#8216;Abdullah. (According to the terms of the treaty, next year) the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) stayed there for three days When it was the third day, they said to &#8216;Ali: This is the last day according to the terms of your companion. So tell him to leave. &#8216;Ali informed the Prophet (may peace be upon him) accordingly. He said: Yes, and left (the city). Ibn Janab in his version of the tradition used:&#8221; we would swear allegiance to you&#8221; instead of&#8221; we would follow you&#8221;.</span></p>

The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to &#8216;Ali: Write&#8221; In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said: As for&#8221; Bismillah,&#8221; we do not know what is meant by&#8221; Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim&#8221; (In the name of Allah most Gracious and most Merciful). But write what we understand, i. e. Bi ismika allahumma (in thy name. O Allah). Then, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Write:&#8221; From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; They said: If we knew that thou welt the Messenger of Allah, we would follow you. Therefore, write your name and the name of your father. So the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Write&#8221; From Muhammad b. &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; They laid the condition on the Prophet (may peace be upon him) that anyone who joined them from the Muslims, the Meccans would not return him, and anyone who joined you (the Muslims) from them, you would send him back to them. The Companions said: Messenger of Allah, should we write this? He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join them-may Allah keep him away! and one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back) Allah will provide him relief and a way of escape.</span></p>

If we had thought it fit to fight, we could fight. This was in the truce between the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the polytheists. Umar b. Khattab came, approached the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, aren&#8217;t we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: By all means. He asked: Are not those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed. from their side in the Fire? He replied: Yes. He said: Then why should we put a blot upon our religion and return, while Allah has not decided the issue between them and ourselves? He said: Son of Khattab, I am the Messenger of Allah.

Abu Bakr said: Son of Khattab, verily, he is the Messenger of Allah, and Allah will never ruin him. (The narrator continued): At this (a Sura of) the Qur&#8217;an (giving glad tidings of the victory) was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He sent for Umar and made him read it. He asked: Is (this truce) a victory? He (the Messenger of Allah) replied: Yes. At this Umar was pleased, and returned.</span></p>

He said: I have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of &#8216;Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn Abd Yalil b. Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn al-Tha&#8217;alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I looked and lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said.: God. the Honoured and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou wishest (him to do) with, regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, greeted me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains. and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest order me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between, (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.</span></p>

(He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and &#8216;Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur&#8217;an. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubida. He said: Sa&#8217;d, haven&#8217;t you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa&#8217;d said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Holy Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>O God, if Thou hadst not guided us</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity,</span></p>

A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array &#8216;Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and &#8216;Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What&#8217;s the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for &#8216;Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.</span></p>

Akwa&#8217; who said: On the day of the Battle of Khaibar my brother fought a fierce fight by the side of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). His sword rebounded and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) permitted him. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if God had guided us not,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would hive neither been guided aright nor practised charity,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What you have said is true, &#8216;I (continued):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And descend on us peace and tranquillity</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And keep us steadfast if we encounter (with our enemies)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And the polytheists have rebelled against us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When I finished my rajaz, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who composed these verses? I said: They were composed by my brother. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: May God show mercy to him! I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God&#8217;s mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He died as God&#8217;s devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b. Akwa&#8217;) about (the death of &#8216;Amir). He related to me a similar tradition except that he said: When I said some people were reluctant invoke God&#8217;s blessings on him, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him said: They lied. (&#8216;Amir) died as God&#8217;s devotee and warrior (in the cause of Allah). For him there is a double reward, and he pointed out this by putting his two fingers together.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won&#8217;t you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn&#8217;t matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle &#8216;Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from&#8221; Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion. God revealed the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them&#8221; (xlviii. 24). Then we moved returning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked God&#8217;s forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And today is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And tody is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa&#8217;. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I caught hold of the rein of Akhram&#8217;s horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd al-Rahman&#8217;s horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned about riding Akhram&#8217;s horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), met &#8216;Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn&#8217;t see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa&#8217; who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa&#8217;. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I met &#8216;Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa&#8217; and his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba&#8217;. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don&#8217;t you show consideration to a dignified person and don&#8217;t you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And descend tranquillity upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this? &#8216;Amir said: it is &#8216;Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed, and well-tried warrior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar certainly knows that I am &#8216;Amir,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>They exchanged blows. Marbab&#8217;s sword struck the shield of &#8216;Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for &#8216;Amir there is a double reward. Then he sent me to &#8216;Ali who had tore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to &#8216;Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and &#8216;Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8216;Ali chanted in reply:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the one whose mother named him Haidar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa&#8217; (i. e. return thir attack with one that is much more fierce).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The narrator said: &#8216;Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaibar) was due to him. This long tradition has also been handed down Through a different chain of transmitters.</span></p>

Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book Pertaining to Punishments Prescribed by Islam (Kitab Al-Hudud) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh. This word is the plural of Hadd, which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and hence a restrictive ordinance or statute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and the other Ta&#8217;zir. The Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In Ta&#8217;zir, the court, is allowed to use its discretion in regard to the form and measure in which such punishment is to be inflicted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning, amputation of a limb or limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes. They are prescribed respectively for the following offences: adultery committed by married persons, theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander imputing unchastity to women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above mentioned crimes. These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which the crimes were committed, the nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal with which he committed the crime.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do you intercede regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah? He then stood up and addressed (people) saying: O people, those who have gone before you were destroyed, because if any one of high rank committed theft amongst them, they spared him; and it anyone of low rank committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Allah, if Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, were to steal, I would have her hand cut off.

They said: Who would speak to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about her? They (again) said: Who can dare do this but Usama b Zaid, the loved one of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? She was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Usama b. Zaid spoke about her to him (interceded on her behalf). The colour of the face of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) changed, and he said: Do you intercede in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah? He (Usama) said: &#8216;Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me. When it was dusk. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and gave an address. He (first) glorified Allah as He deserves, and then said: Now to our topic. This (injustice) destroyed those before you that when any one of (high) rank committed theft among them, they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, even if Fatima daughter of Muhammad were to commit theft, I would have cut off her hand. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded about that woman who had committed theft, and her hand was cut off. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) said: Hers was a good respentance, and she later on married and used to come to me after that, and I conveyed her needs (and problems) to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>

The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.</p>

He said: Bring Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) called them (the Jews) and said: Is this the punishment that you find in your Book (Torah) as a prescribed punishment for adultery? They said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in the name of Allah Who sent down the Torah on Moses if that is the prescribed punishment for adultery that you find in your Book. He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive Thy command when they had made it dead. He then commanded and he (the offender) was stoned to death. Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down (this verse):&#8221; O Messenger, (the behaviour of) those who vie with one another in denying the truth should not grieve you&#8230;&#8221; up to&#8221; is vouchsafed unto you, accept it&#8221; (v. 41) 2176 It was said (by the Jews): Go to Muhammad; it he commands you to blacken the face and award flogging (as punishment for adultery), then accept it, but it he gives verdict for stoning, then avoid it. It was (then) that Allah, the Majestic and Great, sent down (these verses):&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed are, indeed, deniers of the truth&#8221; (v. 44) ;&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed-they, they indeed are the wrongdoers&#8221; (v. 45) ;&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed-they are the iniquitous (v. 47).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubida b. as-Samit reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took (a pledge) from us as he took from the women that we will not associate anything with Allah and we will not steal, and we will not commit adultery, and we will not kill our children, and we will not bring calumny upon one another. And he who amongst you fulfils (this pledge), his reward rests with Allah, and he upon whom amongst you is imposed the prescribed punishment and that is carried out, that is his expiation (for that sin), and he whose (sins) were covered by Allah, his matter rests with Allah. He may punish him if He likes or may forgive him if He so likes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubida b. as-Samit repnrted: I was one of those headmen who swore allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that we will not associate anything with Allah, and will not commit adultery, and will not steal, and will not kill any soul which Allah has forbidden, but with justice nor plunder, nor disobey (Allah and His Apostle), then Paradise (will be the reward) in case we do these (acts) ; and if we commit any outrage (and that goes unpunished in the world), it is Allah Who would decide about it. Ibn Rumh said: Its judgment lies with Allah.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak). So he kept quiet, and his companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he (&#8216;Abd al Rahman) spoke along with them and they narrated to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the murder of &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl. Thereupon he said to them: Are you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to blood-wit) of your companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an oath on a matter which we have not witnessed? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths. They said: How can we accept the oaths of people who are unbelievers? When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he himself paid his blood-wit.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Show regard for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin speaking. Then they (Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa) spoke about the matter of their companion (murder of their cousin, &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to you. They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.</p>

Thereupon (Allah&#8217;s Messenger is reported to have said): Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by taking fifty oaths. They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how can we accept the oath of unbelieving people? Bushair said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood-wit himself.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, himself paid the blood-wit to them and sent to them one hundred camels until they entered into their houses, Sahl said: One red she-camel among them kicked me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Safwan b. Ya&#8217;la b. Umayya thus reported from his father: I participated in the expedition to Tabuk with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And Ya&#8217;la used to say: That was the most weighty of my deeds, in my opinion. Safwan said that Ya&#8217;la had stated: I had a servant; he quarrelled with another person, and the one bit the hand of the other. (&#8216;Ata&#8217; said that Safwan had told him which one had bitten the hand of the other.) So he whose hand was bitten drew ill from (the mouth) of the one who had bitten it and (in this scuffle) one of his foreteeth was also drawn out. They both came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he declared his (claim for the compensation of) tooth as invalid.</p>

Dhu&#8217;l-Qa&#8217;da, Dhu&#8217;l- Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha&#8217;ban. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: which month is this?

Thereupon he said: Your blood, your property (Muhammad, one of the narrators, said: I think, he also said this) and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours. You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears.

He (the narrator) said: We stayed there as long as Allah willed. Then there were brought to him (to the Holy Prophet) camels. He (the Holy Prophet) then ordered to give us three white humped camels, We started and said (or some of us said to the others): Allah will not bless us. We came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) begging him to provide us with riding camels. He swore that he could not provide us with a mount, but later on he provided us with that. They (some of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came and informed him about this (rankling of theirs), whereupon he said: It was not I who provided you with a mount, but Allah has provided you with that. So far as I am concerned, by Allah, if He so wills, I would not swear, but if, later on, I would see better than it, I (would break the vow) and expiate it and do that which is better.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa reported: My friends sent me to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asking him to provide them with mounts as they were going along with him in jaish al-&#8216;Usrah (the army of destitutes or of meagre means or army setting out during the hard times and that is the occasion of the expedition of Tabuk) I said: Apostle of Allah, my friends have sent me to you so that you may provide them with mounts. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: &#8216;Abdullah b. Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa&#8217;d), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which he did not say. They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayyub said: We were sitting in the company of Abu Musa that he called for food and it consisted of flesh of fowl. It was then that a person from Banu Tamim visited him. His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl&#8217;s meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash&#8217;ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allali&#8217;s Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran b. Husain reported that the tribe of Thaqif was the ally of Banu &#8216;Uqail. Thaqif took two persons from amongst the Companiobs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as prisoners. The Campanions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took one person at Banu Uqail as prisoner, and captured al-&#8216;Adbi (the she-camel of the Holy Prophet) along with him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was very compassionate, and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Adbi&#8217; was caught. The woman had been tied with ropes. The people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. She escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and fumed and so she left them until she came to al-, Adbi&#8217;. It did not fret and fume; it was docile She rode upon its back and drove it away and she went off. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) took vow for Allah, that in case He would save her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice. As she reached Medina, the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adbi, the she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Messanger (may peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it that she took vow to Allah that if He saves her on its back, she would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the version of Ibn Hujr (the words are):&#8221; There is no vow in disobedience to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 12: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Gifts (Kitab Al-Hibat) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of  property, movable and immovable, from one person to the other willingly and without any  reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as donor (Wahib), and the thing  transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is known as Mauhub lahu  (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar&#8217;i&#8217;ah are Nihla or &#8216;Atiyya. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders  the possession of the thing donated. Moreover, the declaration of donation should be in  clear terms without any ambiguity (around them). This act of donation is based on the  following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him):&#8221; Give presents to one  another for this would increase your mutual love.&#8221; This not only implies the legality  of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement  amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by  any person capable of making a contract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid,  and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond one-third of the assets of the  deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be made to a living  person and not to one who is dead. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Shari&#8217;ah imposes certain restrictions on the property  which is to be donated. In the first place, the property must be in existence at the time  when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesame or of butter in the milk would  not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked except in some  extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by him  from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah. The  right to revoke a gift is called Raj&#8217;. This act of revocation can be done with the decree  of a competent court. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I    donated a pedigree horse in the path of Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought    that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah&#8217;s Menengsr (may peace be upon him)    about it, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who    gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated    on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this    addition:&#8221; Don&#8217;t buy that even if he gives you for one dirham.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of his father that    &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) donated a horse in the path of Allah. He found that it    had languished in the hand of its possessor, and he was a man of meagre resources He    (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) intended to buy it. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy that even if you get it    for a dirham for he who gets back the charity is like a dog which swallows its vomit.</font></p>

He deferred    the matter by one year, and then set forth to do that. She (Nu&#8217;man&#8217;s mother) said: I shall    not be pleased unless you call Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as witness to    what you confer as a gift on your son. (Nu&#8217;man said): So father took hold of my hand and I    was at that time a boy, and came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). and said:    Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the mother of this son (of mine), daughter of Rawaha wishes that I    should call you witness to what I confer as gift to her son. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may pease    be upon him) said: Bashir, have you any other son besides this (son of yours)? He said:    Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you given gifts to all of them like this? He said:    No. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Then call me not as witness, for I cannot be    witness to an injustice.</font></p>

That (property) becomes    the their defect belonging. The donor cannot (after declaring Umra) lay down any condition    or make any exception.
