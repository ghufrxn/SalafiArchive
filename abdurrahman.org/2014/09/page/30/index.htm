<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is  the best deed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed  times.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next in goodness?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To be good  and dutiful to your parents.&#8221; I further asked, what is next in goodness?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To participate in Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; I did not ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 42: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is no Hijra (i.e.  migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good  intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth  immediately. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 43: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(That she said), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We consider Jihad  as the best deed. Should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The best  Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet&#8217;s  tradition and is accepted by Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 44: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Instruct me  as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not find such  a deed.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the  battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break  your fast?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;But who can do that?&#8221; Abu- Huraira added,  &#8220;The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse  while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 45: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Somebody asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is the best  among the people?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied &#8220;A believer who strives his utmost in  Allah&#8217;s Cause with his life and property.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Allah and  leaving the people secure from his mischief.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 46: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The example of a  Mujahid in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8211; and Allah knows better who really strives in His Cause&#8212;-is  like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Allah guarantees that He will admit the  Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his  home safely with rewards and war booty.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 47: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who  would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, once  visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, &#8220;What causes  you to smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Some of my followers who (in a  dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause (on board a ship) amidst this  sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the  thrones).&#8221; (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet  used.) Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um  Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Some  of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause,&#8221; repeating the  same dream. Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of  them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are amongst the first ones.&#8221; It happened that she  sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu&#8217;awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she  disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 48: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and His  Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted  Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah&#8217;s Cause or remains in the land  where he is born.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the  people with the is good news?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Paradise has one-hundred grades which  Allah has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each  of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask  Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of  Paradise.&#8221; (i.e. The sub-narrator added, &#8220;I think the Prophet also said, &#8216;Above  it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the  rivers of Paradise.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two men came to me (in a  dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house,  better of which I have never seen. One of them said, &#8216;This house is the house of  martyrs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor (of fighting) in  Allah&#8217;s Cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is  in it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A place in Paradise as small as a  bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world).&#8221; He  also said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is  better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause  in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.053"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 53: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody who dies and finds good from  Allah (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the  whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on seeing the superiority of  martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and get killed again (in Allah&#8217;s  Cause).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor  (of fighting) in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the  world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you  is better than all the world and whatever is in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared  to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with  light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is!  Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I  cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya&#8217;  (army-unit) setting out in Allah&#8217;s Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love  to be martyred in Al1ah&#8217;s Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then  get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get  martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;Zaid took  the flag and was martyred, and then Ja&#8217;far took the flag and was martyred, and then  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took  the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and Allah made him victorious.&#8221;  The Prophet further added, &#8220;It would not please us to have them with us.&#8221; Aiyub,  a sub-narrator, added, &#8220;Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, &#8216;It would not p ease  them to be with us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Haram said, &#8220;Once the Prophet slept in my house  near to me and got up smiling. I said, &#8216;What makes you smile?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Some of my  followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings  on thrones.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; So the  Prophet invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and  told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said,  &#8220;Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are among the first  batch.&#8221; Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband &#8216;Ubada  bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval  expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to  Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus  she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim  to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them,  &#8220;I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me.&#8221; So he went  ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message  of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal  uncle said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful.&#8221; After  that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up  to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think another man was  saved along with him).&#8221; Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met  their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite,  &#8220;Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made  us pleased &#8221; Later on this Quranic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Allah for  forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam  Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of  Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought  against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt.  Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221; On the day of Uhud when the Muslims  turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologize to You for what these  (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have  done.&#8221; Then he advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said &#8220;O Sad bin Muadh ! By  the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain  of) Uhud,&#8221; Later on Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he  (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his  body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister  could recognize him by his fingers.&#8221; We used to think that the following Verse was  revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who  have been true to their covenant with Allah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (33.23) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>His sister Ar-Rubbaya&#8217; broke a front tooth of a woman and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered for retaliation. On that Anas (bin An-Nadr) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister&#8217;s tooth shall not be  broken.&#8221; Then the opponents of Anas&#8217;s sister accepted the compensation and gave up  the claim of retaliation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are some people amongst  Allah&#8217;s slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by Allah when they take them.&#8221; </font></p>

She added, &#8220;If he is in Paradise, I will be  patient; otherwise, I will weep bitterly for him.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O mother of Hartha!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Divine Inspiration: &#8220;Those of the believers  who sit (at home), was revealed the Prophet sent for Zaid (bin Thabit) who came with a  shoulder-blade and wrote on it. Ibn Um-Maktum complained about his blindness and on that  the following revelation came: &#8220;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home)  except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive  hard and fight in the Way of Allah with their wealth and lives).&#8221; (4.95) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the Mosque. So I came  forward and sat by his side. He told us that Zaid bin Thabit had told him that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had dictated to him the Divine Verse: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and  those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and lives.&#8217; (4.95)  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid said, &#8220;Ibn-Maktum came to the Prophet while he  was dictating to me that very Verse. On that Ibn Um Maktum said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  If I had power, I would surely take part in Jihad.&#8221; He was a blind man. So Allah sent  down revelation to His Apostle while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me  that I feared that my thigh would be broken. Then that state of the Prophet was over after  Allah revealed &#8220;&#8230;except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame  etc.) (4.95) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;Nothing  worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly  blessings which will be conferred on you.&#8221; Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures.  He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?&#8221; The  Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the  people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked,  &#8220;Where is the present questioner?&#8221; &#8220;Do you think wealth is good?&#8221; he  repeated thrice, adding, &#8220;No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like  what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals  because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks  are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and  urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How  excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent  in Allah&#8217;s Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it  legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against  him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

I am coming just now,&#8217; and went on perfuming  himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people  fled from the battle-field.

He ate of  its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of  three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a  means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are  a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a  long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area  of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his  benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its  dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river  and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will  get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he  is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for  Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked  about donkeys, he replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this  unique, comprehensive Verse: &#8220;Then anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s)  weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s) weight of  evil, shall see it.&#8217; (101.7-8) </font></p>

While I was in that state the camel stopped  suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;O Jabir, wait!&#8217; Then he  hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, &#8216;Will you  sell the camel?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went  to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the  pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, &#8216;This is your camel.&#8217; He came out and  started examining the camel and saying, &#8216;The camel is ours.&#8217; Then the Prophet sent some  Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, &#8216;Give it to Jabir.&#8217; Then he asked, &#8216;Have you taken  the full price (of the camel)?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Somebody asked Al-Bar-a bin &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Did you flee  deserting Allah&#8217;s Apostle during the battle of Hunain?&#8221; Al-Bara replied, &#8220;But  Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not flee. The people of the Tribe of Hawazin were good archers. When  we met them, we attacked them, and they fled. When the Muslims started collecting the war  booty, the pagans faced us with arrows, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not flee. No doubt, I saw  him on his white mule and Abu Sufyan was holding its reins and the Prophet was saying, &#8216;I  am the Prophet in truth: I am the son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O  Allah! Let her be one of them.&#8221; Then he (slept again and woke up and) smiled.

Paradise is  for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Allah&#8217;s Cause, with his hair unkempt  and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied  with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post  with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is  not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Choose one of your boy  servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.&#8221; So, Abu Talha took me letting me  ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Allah&#8217;s  Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! I seek  refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness  and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men.&#8221; Then we  reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty  of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while  she was a bride. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him  till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,&#8217; where her menses were over and he took her  for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle folding a cloak  round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him)  He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the  camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and  said, &#8220;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us.&#8221; Then he looked at  Medina and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains  a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of  Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures).&#8221; </font></p>

Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;You  are amongst them.&#8221; He slept again and then woke up smiling and said the same as  before twice or thrice.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the pagans faced each other and started  fighting. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned to their  camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would  follow and kill with his sword any pagan going alone. He said, &#8220;Nobody did his job  (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed,  he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;I  shall accompany him (to watch what he does)&#8221; Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he  stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided  to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground  directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the  sword and killed himself. The other man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify  that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;(It is about) the man whom you had described as one of the people of the  (Hell) Fire. The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, &#8216;I will find  out his reality for you.&#8217; So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and  hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end  towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed  himself.&#8221; when Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A man may seem to the people as if he were  practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the  Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the  people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

Practice  archery as your father Isma&#8217;il was a great archer. Keep on throwing arrows and I am with  Bani so-and-so.&#8221; So one of the parties ceased throwing. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Why do you not throw?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;How should we throw while you are  with them (i.e. on their side)?&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Throw, and I am with  all of you.&#8221; </font></p>

It was the day of &#8216;Id when negroes used to  play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah&#8217;s Apostle or he himself  asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he  let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry  on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!&#8221; When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough.

So, whenever a charitable  person wants to give in charity, his cloak spreads over his body so much so that it wipes  out his traces, but whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron  cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his hands gets connected to  his collar-bones.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked Al-Bara&#8217;, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Umara! Did you all flee  on the day (of the battle) of Hunain?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No, by Allah! Allah&#8217;s  Apostle did not flee, but his young unarmed companions passed by the archers of the tribe  of Hawazin and Bani Nasr whose arrows hardly missed a target, and they threw arrows at  them hardly missing a shot. So the Muslims retreated towards the Prophet while he was  riding his white mule which was being led by his cousin Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib. The Prophet dismounted and invoked Allah for victory; then he said, &#8216;I am  the Prophet, without a lie; I am the son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, and then he arranged his  companions in rows.&#8221; </font></p>

Destroy Quraish; O Allah Destroy Quraish,&#8221; naming especially Abu Jahl bin Hisham,  &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Al Walid bin &#8216;Utba, Ubai bin Khalaf and &#8216;Uqba bin Abi  Mitt.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam  and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to hand it over  to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to  Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory  over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said  after reading t, &#8216;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present  here, in order to ask him about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in  Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that  had been concluded between Allah&#8217;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said,  Caesar&#8217;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and  we were admitted into Ceasar&#8217;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a  crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his  translator. &#8216;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a  prophet.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;I replied, &#8216;I am the nearest relative to him.&#8217; He  asked, &#8216;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He is my cousin,&#8217;  and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &#8216;Let him  come nearer.&#8217; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said  to his translator, &#8216;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who  claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a  liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it  shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his  translator, &#8216;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a  noble family amongst us.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same  before him? &#8216;I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he  claimed what he claimed? &#8216; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a  king?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&#8217; I replied,  &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by  day)?&#8217; I replied,&#8217; They are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace  his (the Prophet&#8217;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&#8217;. I replied,  &#8216;No. &#8216; He said, &#8216;Does he break his promises? I replied, &#8216;No, but we are now at truce with  him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Other than the  last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &#8216;Have you ever had  a war with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What was the outcome of your battles with  him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;  He said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and  not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to  worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what  is entrusted to us.&#8217; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &#8216;Say to him: I  ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact,  all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you  whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the  negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man  was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever  blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a  person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about  Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the  negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted  to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people  followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the  followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true  faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who,  after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was  in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters  and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether  he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles;  they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he  fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory  is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to  worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your  fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep  promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a  prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that  he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the  earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go  immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;  &#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  was read. Its contents were:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most  Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to  Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then,  I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe;  embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this  invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your  nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we  worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none  of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness  that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his  speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him,  and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned  out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them,  &#8216;Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha&#8217;s (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) affair has gained power. This is the King  of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I remained low and  was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I  disliked it &#8221; </font></p>

But the Prophet  asked for &#8216;Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he  ordered them to bring &#8216;Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes  were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;We will fight  with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what  Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands  (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

I have already given to you the  pledge of Allegiance.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do it again.&#8217; So I gave the pledge of allegiance for the  second time.&#8221; I asked &#8216;O Abu Muslim!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Today a man came to me and asked me a question which I did  not know how to answer. He said, &#8220;Tell me, if a wealthy active man, well-equipped  with arms, goes out on military expeditions with our chiefs, and orders us to do such  things as we cannot do (should we obey him?)&#8221; I replied, &#8220;By Allah, I do not  know what to reply you, except that we, were in the company of the Prophet and he used to  order us to do a thing once only till we finished it. And no doubt, everyone among you  will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Allah. If one is in doubt as to the  legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a  time when you will not find such a man. By Him, except Whom none has the right to be  worshipped. I see that the example of what has passed of this life (to what remains  thereof) is like a pond whose fresh water has been used up and nothing remains but muddy  water.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle The  Prophet met me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation and it  had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked me, &#8220;What is wrong with  the camel?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;It has got tired.&#8221; So. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came from  behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and  going ahead of them. Then he asked me, &#8220;How do you find your camel (now)?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Will you sell it to me?&#8221; I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the  only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it to  me then.&#8221; I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I  reached Medina. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a bridegroom,&#8221; and  requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the  people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I  informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had  married a matron. He said, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t you married a virgin who would have played  with you, and you would have played with her?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My  father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that  I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them.  So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners.&#8221; When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me  its price and gave me the camel itself as well. </font></p>

When they saw him they  said, &#8220;This is Muhammad and his army! Muhammad and his army!&#8221; So, they took  refuge in the fort. The Prophet raised both his hands and said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar,  Khaibar is ruined, for when we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then miserable is  the morning of the warned ones.&#8221; Then we found some donkeys which we (killed and)  cooked: The announcer of the Prophet announced: &#8220;Allah and His Apostle forbid you to  eat donkey&#8217;s meat.&#8221; So, all the pots including their contents were turned upside  down. </font></p>

Be merciful to yourselves (i.e. don&#8217;t raise your voice), for you are not  calling a deaf or an absent one, but One Who is with you, no doubt He is All-Hearer, ever  Near (to all things).&#8221; </font></p>

All the Kingdom belongs to Him and all the praises are for Him and He is  Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating ourselves and  praising our Lord.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me,  Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad somewhere saying, &#8216;Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh. There you  will find a lady with a letter. Take the letter from her.&#8217; &#8221; So, we set out and our  horses ran at full pace till we got at Ar-Rawda where we found the lady and said (to her).  &#8220;Take out the letter.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or else we will take off your clothes.&#8221;  So, she took it out of her braid. We brought the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  contained a statement from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to some of the Meccan pagans informing  them of some of the intentions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Don&#8217;t hasten to give  your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not  belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who  would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking  blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I  did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief)  to Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle, said, &#8220;Hatib has told you the truth.&#8221; Umar  said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Hatib participated in the battle of Badr, and who knows, perhaps Allah  has already looked at the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Where is  &#8216;Ali?&#8221; He was told that &#8216;Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to  his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The  Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Should I fight them till they become like us  (i.e. Muslim)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go to them patiently and calmly till you  enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them,  for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than  possessing red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

Then they  killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after they were  Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their  pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet  cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey  were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina).

So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty cavalry men from  the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on  horses, so the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my  chest, he said, &#8216;O Allah!

I, too, went out along with them,  pretending to look for it. They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too,  entered along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept its keys in a  small window where I could see them. When those people slept, I took the keys and opened  the gate of the fort and came upon Abu Rafi and said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I  proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back,  pretending to be a helper. I said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of my voice. He asked  me, &#8216;What do you want; woe to your mother?&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What has happened to you?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know who came to me and hit me.&#8217; Then I drove my sword into his belly and  pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and  went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot.  I came to my companions and said, &#8216;I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.&#8217;  So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant pf Hijaz. Then  I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till we came upon the Prophet and  informed him.&#8221; </font></p>

Do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Allah for safety, but when you face  the enemy, be patient, and remember that Paradise is under the shades of swords.&#8221;  Then he said, &#8220;O Allah, the Revealer of the Holy Book, and the Mover of the clouds  and the Defeater of the clans, defeat them, and grant us victory over them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander  of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He  instructed them, &#8220;Stick to your place, and don&#8217;t leave it even if you see birds  snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and  made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.&#8221; Then  the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes  revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair  said, &#8220;The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what  are you waiting for now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;Have you forgotten what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;By Allah! We will go to the people  (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.&#8221; But when they went to  them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle in their rear  was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred  seventy men from us. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his  companions had caused the &#8216;Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and  seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, &#8220;Is Muhammad present amongst these  people?&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?&#8221; He asked again thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?&#8221; He then returned to his  companions and said, &#8220;As for these (men), they have been killed.&#8221; &#8216;Umar could  not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), &#8220;You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of  Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy  is still there.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;Our victory today is a counterbalance to  yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in  turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I  did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed&#8221; After that he  started reciting cheerfully, &#8220;O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle  What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.&#8221;  (Then) Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to his companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Says Allah is our Helper  and you have no helper.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the  mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me. I said to him,  &#8220;Woe to you! What brought you here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The she-camels of the  Prophet have been taken away.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Who took them?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Ghatafan and Fazara.&#8221; So, I sent three cries, &#8220;O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah  !&#8221; so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains hear  me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing  arrows at them saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8221;; and today perish the mean  people!&#8221; So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could  drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so  send some people to chase them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, you have  gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being  entertained by their folk.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 281: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the  leadership of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin Umar Al-Khattab.  They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between &#8216;Usfan, and Mecca, and their news  reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who  were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had  eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, &#8220;These are the dates  of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), &#8220;and continued following their tracks When &#8216;Asim and his  companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them.  The infidels said to them, &#8220;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you  that we will not kill any one of you&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya  said, &#8220;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O  Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they  martyred &#8216;Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise  and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when  the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the  third (of the captives) said, &#8220;This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go  with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.&#8221; So,  they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed  him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and  all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith  bin &#8216;Amir bin Naufal bin &#8216;Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amir on  the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Iyyad said that the  daughter of Al-Harith had told him, &#8220;When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he  borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of  mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and  the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my  face and said, &#8216;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&#8217; By Allah, I  never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of  grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in  Mecca.&#8221; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &#8220;It was a boon Allah bestowed  upon Khubaib.&#8221; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside  its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed  him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I been afraid that you would  think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah,  kill them all with no exception.&#8221; (He then recited the poetic verse):&#8211; &#8220;I being  martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause, For my killing is for  Allah&#8217;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&#8221;  Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any  Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer (before being  killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he  was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to  them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed,  they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be  recognized. (That was because) &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the  battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over  Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from  his flesh. </font></p>

What (great thing) took  place on Thursday!&#8221; Then he started weeping till his tears wetted the gravels of the  ground . Then he said, &#8220;On Thursday the illness of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was aggravated and  he said, &#8220;Fetch me writing materials so that I may have something written to you  after which you will never go astray.&#8221; The people (present there) differed in this  matter and people should not differ before a prophet. They said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle is  seriously sick.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;Let me alone, as the state in which I am now, is  better than what you are calling me for.&#8221; The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three  orders saying, &#8220;Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts  to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them.&#8221; I forgot the third  (order)&#8221; (Ya&#8217;qub bin Muhammad said, &#8220;I asked Al-Mughira bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman about  the Arabian Peninsula and he said, &#8216;It comprises Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and  Yemen.&#8221; Ya&#8217;qub added, &#8220;And Al-Arj, the beginning of Tihama.&#8221;) </font></p>

Buy this cloak and adorn  yourself with it on the &#8216;Id festivals and on meeting the delegations.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle replied, &#8220;This is the dress for the one who will have no share in the  Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter).&#8221; After  sometime had passed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a silken cloak to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar took it and  brought it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You have said that this  is the dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who  will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have sent me this!&#8221; The Prophet  said,&#8221; I have sent it) so that you may sell it or fulfill with it some of your  needs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet set out  with the Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the hillocks of  Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty. He did not notice (the  Prophet&#8217;s presence) till the Prophet stroked him on the back with his hand and said,  &#8220;Ibn Saiyad! Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him  and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. &#8220;Do you testify  that I am the apostle of Allah?&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;I believe in Allah  and His Apostles.&#8221; Then the Prophet said (to Ibn Saiyad). &#8220;What do you  see?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad replied, &#8220;True people and false ones visit me.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Your mind is confused as to this matter.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8221; I have kept something (in my mind) for you.&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is  Ad-Dukh.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Shame be on you! You cannot cross your  limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head  off.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot  overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Later on) Allah&#8217;s Apostle (once again) went along with  Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the Prophet  entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palms as he  wanted to hear something from the Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad  was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn  Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the  date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf!&#8221; (And this was his name). Ibn  Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman let him to himself, he would have  revealed the reality of his case.&#8221; Then the Prophet got up amongst the people,  glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, &#8220;I warn you about  him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and  Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his  nation of. You should understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah is not  one-eyed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aslam: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called  Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or  other specified animals). He said to him, &#8220;O Hunai! Don&#8217;t oppress the Muslims and  ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is  responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few  sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  bin &#8216;Auf and the livestock of (&#8216;Uthman) bin &#8216;Affan, for if their livestock should perish,  then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own  a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and  appeal for help saying, &#8216;O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!&#8217; Would I then  neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass  rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims&#8217; treasury). By Allah, these  people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the  pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in  their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my  custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah&#8217;s Cause, I would not have turned  even a span of their land into a Hima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and  he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, &#8220;This (man) is from the  people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man fought violently till he  got wounded. Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man whom you described as being  from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;He will go to the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Some people were on the point of doubting  (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone  said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and  committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, &#8220;Allah is Greater!  I testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8221; Then he ordered Bilal to announce  amongst the people: &#8216;None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Allah may support this  religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usiya and Bani  Lihyan came to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they requested  him to support them with some men to fight their own people. The Prophet supported them  with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of  piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the  (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi&#8217;r-Ma&#8217;ana where they betrayed and  martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan  for one month in the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi said, &#8220;We were in the company of  the Prophet at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and  sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the  cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset  and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one  camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few  horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s  Permission). On that the Prophet said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so,  if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the  Prophet ), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have  no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied,  &#8220;If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if  Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won&#8217;t  use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering  with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the  Ethiopians.&#8221; </font></p>

So I proceeded with  one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the  Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand  and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and a  guiding and rightly-guided man.&#8221; Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and  burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did  not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel  (covered with tar).&#8221; So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of  Ahmas five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mujashi (bin Mas&#8217;ud) took his brother Mujalid bin Musud to  the Prophet and said, &#8220;This is Mujalid and he will give a pledge of allegiance to you  for migration.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;There is no migration after the Conquest of  Mecca, but I will take his pledge of allegiance for Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I and &#8216;Ubai bin &#8216;Umar went to &#8216;Aisha while she was staying  near Thabir (i.e. a mountain). She said, &#8220;There is no Migration after Allah gave His  Prophet victory over Mecca.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 314: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin &#8216;Ubaida: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman  said to Abu Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, &#8220;I perfectly know what  encouraged your leader (i.e. &#8216;Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: Once the Prophet  sent me and Az-Zubair saying, &#8216;Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will  find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested  the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, &#8216;Hatib has not given me any letter.&#8217; We  said to her. &#8216;Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.&#8217; So she took it  out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t hurry in  judging me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is  increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions  but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody  there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and  property).&#8217; The Prophet believed him. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib&#8217;s)  neck as he has done hypocrisy.&#8217; The Prophet said, (to &#8216;Umar), &#8216;Who knows, perhaps Allah  has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman added, &#8220;So this is what encouraged him (i.e.  Ali).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet returned (from Jihad), he would say Takbir  thrice and add, &#8220;We are returning, if Allah wishes, with repentance and worshipping  and praising (our Lord) and prostrating ourselves before our Lord. Allah fulfilled His  Promise and helped His Slave, and He Alone defeated the (infidel) clans.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet while returning from  &#8216;Usfan, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was riding his she-camel keeping Safiya bint Huyay riding  behind him. His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. Abu Talha jumped from his  camel and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for you.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Take care of the lady.&#8221; So, Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and  went to Safiya and covered her with it, and then he set right the condition of their  shecamel so that both of them rode, and we were encircling Allah&#8217;s Apostle like a cover.  When we approached Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;We are returning with repentance and  worshipping and praising our Lord.&#8221; He kept on saying this till he entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he and Abu Talha came in the company of the Prophet  and Safiya was accompanying the Prophet, who let her ride behind him on his she-camel.  During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the Prophet and (his) wife fell down.  Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel  quickly) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get  hurt?&#8221; The Prophet replied,&#8221;No, but take care of the lady.&#8221; Abu Talha  covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his  garment, and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and both of  them (i.e. the Prophet and his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The  Prophet said, &#8220;We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising our  Lord.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying this statement till he entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the presence of &#8216;Aisha some people mentioned that the  Prophet had appointed &#8216;Ali by will as his successor. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;When did he  appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my  lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not  even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abu Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca,  (&#8216;Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already  migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad  bin Khaula).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May I will all my property (in  charity)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then may I will half of it?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. I said, &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes, one third, yet  even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to  leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake will be considered  as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth. Allah may  lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by  you.&#8221; At that time Sad had only one daughter. </font></p>

This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and  for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation).&#8221; Then the Prophet said to his wife  Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a, &#8220;Screen yourself from this boy,&#8221; when he saw the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died. </font></p>

Don&#8217;t delay giving in charity  till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, &#8216;Give so much to so-and-so and  so much to so-and so,&#8217; and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to  so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the  meaning of the Quranic Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with  the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&#8221; (4.2-3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said, &#8220;It is about a female orphan under the  guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,  and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So  they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full  appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later  on the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding  women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl  was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving  her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for  lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman  instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he  had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her  justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights. </font></p>

I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity.&#8221;  The Prophet; said, &#8220;Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees  on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor  bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar gave it in charity,  and it was for Allah&#8217;s Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for  travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it  reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no  intention of becoming wealthy by its means. </font></p>

So you can use it as Allah directs you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to  which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and  I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives.&#8221; On that Abu Talha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will do (as you have suggested).&#8221; So, Abu Talha  distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father was martyred on the day (of the Ghazwa) of Uhud  and left six daughters and some debts to be paid. When the time of plucking the  date-fruits came, I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! you know  that my father was martyred on Uhud&#8217;s day and owed much debt, and I wish that the  creditors would see you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and collect the various kinds of  dates and place them separately in heaps&#8221;&#8216; I did accordingly and called him. On  seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the  Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over  it and said, &#8220;Call your companions (i.e. the creditors).&#8221; Then he kept on  measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father&#8217;s debts. By Allah, it would  have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken  a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and  I looked at the heap where Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date  had been taken thereof. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Conditions </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.050.874">Volume 3, Book 50, Number 874: </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to the Treaty (of  Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to  them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and  would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition  and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the  Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin &#8216;Amr.  Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a  Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba  bin Abu Muait who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came  to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for  Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine  them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send  them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers,  Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa: Aisha told me, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine them according to  this Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants  test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (60.10-12) Aisha said,  &#8220;When any of them agreed to that condition Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her, &#8216;I have  accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8217; He would only say that, but, by Allah he never  touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge  of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words  (only).&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for emancipation and at  that time she had not paid any part of her price. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go to your  masters and if they agree that I will pay your price (and free you) on condition that your  Wala&#8217; will be for me, I will pay the money.&#8221; Buraira told her masters about that, but  they refused, and said, &#8220;If &#8216;Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your Wala will  be for us.&#8221; Aisha informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle of that and he said to her, &#8220;Buy and  manumit Buraira as the Wala&#8217; will go to the manumitted.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and beat it and  prayed for Allah&#8217;s Blessings for it. The camel became so fast as it had never been before.  The Prophet then said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He again said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I sold  it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that  camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and  when I went to him) he said, &#8220;I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift  for you.&#8221; (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in  expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to  Medina). </p>

I ask you by Allah  to judge My case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent, who was more learned than  he, said, &#8220;Yes, judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws, and allow me to  speak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He (i .e. the bedouin or the other  man) said, &#8220;My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son  should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred  sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me  that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of  this (man) must be stoned to death.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and  the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled  for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt,  stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death. </p>

Moses then violated the agreement for the first time  because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything,  the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the  third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied.  The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses: </p>

She said, &#8220;I presented the offer to them, but  they refused unless the Wala&#8217; would be for them.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that and  &#8216;Aisha told him about It, he said to her, &#8220;Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that  her Wala&#8217; will be for them, as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha did so. After  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said,  &#8220;What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws?  Any condition which is not in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such  conditions. Allah&#8217;s Rules are the most valid and Allah&#8217;s Conditions are the most solid.

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar&#8217;s hands and feet, Umar got up  delivering a sermon saying, &#8220;No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a contract with the Jews  concerning their properties, and said to them, &#8216;We allow you (to stand in your land) as  long as Allah allows you.&#8217; Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked at  night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except  those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my  mind to exile them.&#8221; When Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu  Al-Haqiq&#8217;s came and addressed &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers, will you exile us  although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our  properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, i.e.: What will  your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you  night after night?&#8221; The Jew replied, &#8220;That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then drove them  out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel  saddles and ropes, etc.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out at the time of  Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &#8220;Khalid bin  Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place  called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&#8221; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive  the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached  him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing  till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them  (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their  best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; (i.e. the  she-camel&#8217;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&#8217; has become stubborn!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she  was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;By the Name of Him  in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will  respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till  he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little  water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all  its water and complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of  his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started  and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with  satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&#8217;i came with  some persons from his tribe Khuza&#8217;a and they were the advisers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who  would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &#8220;I  left Kab bin Luai and &#8216;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and  they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against  you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We  have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &#8216;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened  Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with  them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e.  the &#8216;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish  will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at  least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose  Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am  sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I will  inform them of what you have said.&#8221; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said,  &#8220;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we  will disclose to you if you should like.&#8221; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted  that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said,  &#8220;Relate what you heard him saying.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I heard him saying  so-and-so,&#8221; relating what the Prophet had told him. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Urwa bin Mas&#8217;ud got up and said, &#8220;O people! Aren&#8217;t you the sons? They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Am I not the father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Do you mistrust me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you  know that I invited the people of &#8216;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my  relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a  reasonable proposal, you&#8217;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&#8221; They said,  &#8220;You may meet him.&#8221; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The  Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &#8220;O Muhammad!  Won&#8217;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone  amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse  should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified  people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&#8221; Hearing  that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &#8220;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?&#8221; Urwa said, &#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is Abu  Bakr.&#8221; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for  the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&#8221;  Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&#8217;s beard as he was talking  while Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and  wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet,  Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &#8220;Remove  your hand from the beard of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Urwa raised his head and asked,  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba.&#8221; Urwa  said, &#8220;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your  treachery?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and  took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him,  &#8220;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything  of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of  the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand  of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if  he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they  would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower  their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to  his people and said, &#8220;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar,  Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as  much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would  fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his  face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he  performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke,  they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of  respect.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable  offer, so please accept it.&#8221; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &#8220;Allow me  to go to him,&#8221; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his  companions, Allah&#8217;s Ap le I said, &#8220;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that  respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of  him.&#8221; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they  were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! It is  not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; When he returned to his  people, he said, &#8216;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with  stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to  go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet  said, &#8220;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&#8221; Mikraz started talking to the  Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &#8220;Now the matter has become easy.&#8221;  Suhail said to the Prophet &#8220;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &#8220;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most  Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Beneficent,&#8217; by Allah, I  do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write  previously.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name  of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Write: By  Your Name O Allah.&#8221; Then he dictated, &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle has concluded.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, if we knew that you are  Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with  you. So, write: &#8220;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah! I am  Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that  he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e.  by letting him and his companions perform &#8216;Umra.)&#8221; The Prophet said to Suhail,  &#8220;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) so that we may  perform Tawaf around it.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not (allow you this  year) so as not to give chance to the &#8216;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we  will allow you next year.&#8221; So, the Prophet got that written. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Suhail said, &#8220;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to  you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;Glorified be  Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim?  While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &#8216;Amr came from the valley of  Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &#8220;O  Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall  return Abu Jandal to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The peace treaty has not been  written yet.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;I will never allow you to keep him.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, do.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do.: Mikraz said, &#8220;We allow  you (to keep him).&#8221; Abu Jandal said, &#8220;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the  pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&#8217;t you see how much I have suffered?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said,  &#8220;I went to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&#8217; The Prophet  said, &#8216;Yes, indeed.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t  you tell us that we would go to the Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but  did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;So you  will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; &#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;I went to Abu  Bakr and said, &#8216;O Abu Bakr! Isn&#8217;t he truly Allah&#8217;s Prophet?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Indeed, he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by  Allah, he is on the right.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba  and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the  Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;You will go to Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf  around it.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said, &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I performed many good deeds as  expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&#8217; &#8220;) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to his  companions, &#8220;Get up and&#8217; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&#8221; By  Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them  got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&#8217;s attitudes towards  him. Um Salama said, &#8220;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried  out? Go out and don&#8217;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and  call your barber to shave your head.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to  anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who  shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their  sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that  there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet  ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:&#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them  . . .&#8221; (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan  married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to  Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his  pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Abide by the promise you gave us.&#8221;  So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached  Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to  one of them, &#8220;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&#8221; The other  drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &#8220;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried  it many times.&#8221; Abu Bair said, &#8220;Let me have a look at it.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran  away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him  he said, &#8220;This man appears to have been frightened.&#8221; When he reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.&#8221;  Abu Basir came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill  your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me  from them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he  would be, should he only have supporters.&#8221; When Abu Basir heard that he understood  that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the  seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined  Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till  they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish  heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and  took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him  for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions)  promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet  sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir&#8217;s companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine  Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in  the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had  pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of  ignorance.&#8221; (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess  (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to  write: &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,&#8221; and  prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine  the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the  Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated  (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their  wives, &#8216;Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the  daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza&#8217;i. Later on Mu&#8217;awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the  other.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah  revealed: &#8220;And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you  have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those  whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).&#8221;  (60.11) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a  compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the  pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We  have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim  emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to  return Abu Basir. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Amra: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation.  &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala&#8217;  will be for me.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said  to her, &#8220;Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who  manumits.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;What about those  people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever stipulates such  conditions as are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he  stipulated a hundred such conditions.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Khattab got some land in Khaibar and he went to the Prophet to consult him  about it saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle got some land in Khaibar better than which I have  never had, what do you suggest that I do with it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you  like you can give the land as endowment and give its fruits in charity.&#8221; So Umar gave  it in charity as an endowment on the condition that would not be sold nor given to anybody  as a present and not to be inherited, but its yield would be given in charity to the poor  people, to the Kith and kin, for freeing slaves, for Allah&#8217;s Cause, to the travelers and  guests; and that there would be no harm if the guardian of the endowment ate from it  according to his need with good intention, and fed others without storing it for the  future.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>About the story of &#8216;Aisha and their narrations were similar  attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about &#8216;Aisha, and the Divine  Inspiration was delayed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for &#8216;Ali and Usama to consult them in  divorcing his wife (i.e. &#8216;Aisha). Usama said, &#8220;Keep your wife, as we know nothing  about her except good.&#8221; Buraira said, &#8220;I cannot accuse her of any defect except  that she is still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family&#8217;s dough which the  domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband).&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me  by defaming the reputation of my family?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the  garden where Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as he wanted to hear  secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft  decorated sheet was lying on his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet hiding  behind the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, &#8220;O Saf, this is  Muhammad.&#8221; Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious), the Prophet  said, &#8220;If she had left him undisturbed, he would have revealed his reality.&#8221;  (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details) </font></p>

Then  I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent.&#8221; The Prophet asked her &#8216;Do  you want to remarry Rifa&#8217;a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your  present husband.&#8221; Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin  Al-&#8216;As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what  this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?&#8221; </font></p>

Then &#8216;Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it.  The Prophet said to him, &#8220;How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that  both of you were suckled by the same woman)?&#8221; So, he divorced her and she was married  to another (husband). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him  the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the  lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by  women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city  of Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off  was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing  I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my  necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because  of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the  back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in  weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the  difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the  camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I  found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I  went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and  come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Safwan bin Mu&#8217;attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the  army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me,  and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, &#8220;Inna  lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).&#8221; He  made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs  of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by  the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was  meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the  leader of the false accusers was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to  Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged  statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not  receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got  sick. But he would come, greet and say, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I did not know anything of  what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the  Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the  call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to  our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs in the open  country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah  stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of)  Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Hanata (you there) didn&#8217;t you hear what they said?&#8217; Then she told me  the rumors of the false accusers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I requested  him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I  Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8216;What are the  people talking about?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry much about this matter. By  Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the  women would forge false news about her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Glorified be Allah! Are the people  really taking of this matter?&#8217; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till  morning. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when  he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e.  &#8216;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&#8217;  &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and  there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you  the truth.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &#8216;O Burair. Did you ever see  anything which roused your suspicions about her?&#8217; Buraira said, &#8216;No, by Allah Who has sent  you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of  immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&#8217; On that day  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Who will support me to punish that  person (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my  family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person  about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my  company.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! by  Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will  chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will  fulfill your order.&#8217; On that Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this  incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said,  &#8216;By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill  him.&#8217; On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada), &#8216;By Allah! you are a  liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.&#8217; On  this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other,  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they  became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did  my tears stop, nor could I sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for  two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were  sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I  allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this  state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they  forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited  Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His  Apostle) and then said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you  are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin,  then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and  asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8217; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished  his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I  requested my father to reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I  do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; I said to my mother, &#8216;Talk to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  on my behalf.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the  Quran. I said. &#8216;I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and  that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you  that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I  confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would  believe me. By Allah, I don&#8217;t compare my situation with you except to the situation of  Joseph&#8217;s father (i.e. Jacob) who said, &#8216;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that  which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the  other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought  that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior  to be talked of in the Holy Qur&#8217;an. I had hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a dream in  which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not got up and nobody  had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So, there  overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being  inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping  like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  over, he was smiling and the first word he said, &#8216;Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has  declared your innocence.&#8217; My mother told me to go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I replied, &#8216;By  Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!  They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .&#8221; (24.11) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr,  who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, &#8216;By Allah, I  will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.&#8217; But Allah  later revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those who are good and wealthy among you  swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah&#8217;s  Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you?  Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said,  &#8216;Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,&#8217; and resumed helping Mistah whom he  used to help before. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the  Prophet&#8217;s wife about me saying, &#8216;What do you know and what did you see?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By  Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&#8221; Aisha further added &#8220;Zainab  was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet&#8217;s love), yet Allah protected her  (from being malicious), for she had piety.&#8221; </font></p>

This was  said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece of land between me and a man from the  Jews who denied my right. I took him to the Prophet. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8216;Do you  have an evidence?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, &#8216;Take an oath.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He will surely take an oath and take my property unjustly.&#8221; So,  Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations  prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Allah&#8217;s limits and  orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got  seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have  to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them  (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started making a hole in the bottom of  the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have  to get water.&#8217; Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves,  but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 852: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Al-Ala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants  should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in  their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, &#8220;Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he  got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to our  house and I said, (addressing the dead &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be merciful to  you. I testify that Allah has blessed you.&#8217; The Prophet said to me, &#8220;How do you know  that Allah has blessed him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;I do not know O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my  parents be sacrificed for you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards Uthman, by Allah he has  died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Allah, although I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do  not know what will be done to him.&#8217; Um Al-Ala added, &#8216;By Allah I shall never attest the  piety of anybody after him. And what Allah&#8217;s Apostles said made me sad.&#8221; Um Al-Ala  further said, &#8220;Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for Uthman. So I  went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about it, he said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his  deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 853: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot fell. He  also used to fix for everyone of his wives a day and a night, but Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a gave  her day and night to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet intending thereby to please Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 854: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If the people knew what is the  reward of making the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the  prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except by casting lots, they  would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, they would  race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they  would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there. </font></p>

We used to see the  crescent, and then the crescent and then the crescent in this way we saw three crescents  in two months and no fire (for cooking) used to be made in the houses of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.

Then what use to sustain you?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The two  black things: dates and water, our neighbors from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to  present Allah&#8217;s Apostle some of their milk and he used to make us drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent for a woman from the emigrants and she had  a slave who was a carpenter. The Prophet said to her &#8220;Order your slave to prepare the  wood (pieces) for the pulpit.&#8221; So, she ordered her slave who went and cut the wood  from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit,  the woman informed the Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send  that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 744: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 745: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us in this house of ours and  asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 746: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran  after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who  slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (The narrator confirms  that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas,  &#8220;Did the Prophet; eat from it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He ate from it.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated As-Sa&#8217;b bin Jaththama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An onager was presented to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the place  called Al-Abwa&#8217; or Waddan, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the  signs of sorrow on the giver&#8217;s face he said, &#8220;We have not rejected your gift, but we  are in the state of Ihram.&#8221; (i.e. if we were not in a state of Ihram we would have  accepted your gift, Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to look forward for the days of my  (&#8216;Aisha&#8217;s) turn to send gifts to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to please him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 749: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said: Um Hufaid, Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217;s aunt sent some  dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The  Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The mastigar was eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and if it had  been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet they requested him to return their property and their captives. He said to them,  &#8220;This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to  me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the  property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return  except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly. (Az-Zuhn, the  sub-narrator said, &#8220;This is what we know about the captives, of Hawazin.&#8221;) </font></p>

There was a man who had about a Sa of  wheat which was mixed with water then. A very tall pagan came driving sheep. The Prophet  asked him, &#8220;Will you sell us (a sheep) or give it as a present?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;I will sell you (a sheep).&#8221; The Prophet bought a sheep and it was slaughtered.  The Prophet ordered that its liver and other abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the  Prophet gave every person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of that; he gave all those  of them who were present; and kept the shares of those who were absent.The Prophet then  put its meat in two huge basins and all of them ate to their fill, and even then more food  was left in the two basins which were carried on the camel (or said something like it). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.693">Volume 3, Book 46, Number 693: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah  will save all the parts of his body from the (Hell) Fire as he has freed the body-parts of  the slave.&#8221; Said bin Marjana said that he narrated that Hadith to &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain  and he freed his slave for whom &#8216;Abdullah bin Ja&#8217;far had offered him ten thousand Dirhams  or one-thousand Dinars. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.694"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 694: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the best deed?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To believe in Allah and to fight for His Cause.&#8221; I then asked,  &#8220;What is the best kind of manumission (of slaves)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The  manumission of the most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;If I cannot afford to do that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Help the weak or do good for a  person who cannot work for himself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If I cannot do that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a charitable deed for  your own good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 695: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ordered us to free slaves at the time of solar  eclipses. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.696"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 696: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were ordered to free slaves at the time of lunar  eclipses. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.697"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 697: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits a slave owned by  two masters, should manumit him completely (not partially) if he is rich after having its  price evaluated.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.698"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 698: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever frees his share of a  common slave and he has sufficient money to free him completely, should let its price be  estimated by a just man and give his partners the price of their shares and manumit the  slave; otherwise (i.e. if he has not sufficient money) he manumits the slave  partially.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.699"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 699: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  slave, then it is essential for him to get that slave manumitted&#8217; completely as long as he  has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay the price of the other  shares (after the price of the slave is evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the  slave partially in proportion to his share. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.700"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 700: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>as above BRIEFLY. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.701"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 701: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who manumits his share of a  slave and has money sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave&#8217;s price (justly  estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price to the other  co-owners).&#8221; Nafi&#8217; added, &#8220;Otherwise the slave is partially free.&#8221; Aiyub is  not sure whether the last statement was said by Nafi&#8217; or it was a part of the Hadith. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.702"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 702: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or  female slaves owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of the  slave. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say in such a case, &#8220;The manumitted should manumit the slave  completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of the price of that slave (which is  to be justly estimated) and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares  and the slave is freed (released from slavery).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar narrated this verdict from  the Prophet. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.703"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 703: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees his portion of a  (common) slave.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.704"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 704: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees his portion of a  common slave should free the slave completely by paying the rest of his price from his  money if he has enough money; otherwise the price of the slave is to be estimated and the  slave is to be helped to work without hardship till he pays the rest of his price.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 705: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has accepted my invocation to  forgive what whispers in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it to action or utter  it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol. 8) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.706"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 706: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The (reward of) deeds depend on  intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he intends. So, whoever  migrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his migration will be for Allah and His Apostle,  and whoever migrated for worldly benefits or for marrying a woman, then his migration will  be for what he migrated for.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 1, Vol. 1) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.707"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 707: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave set out intending  to embrace Islam they lost each other on the way. The slave then came while Abu Huraira  was sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Your slave has come  back.&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Indeed, I would like you to witness that I have  manumitted him.&#8221; That happened at the time when Abu Huraira recited (the following  poetic verse):&#8211; &#8216;What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us  From the land of Kufr (disbelief). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.708"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 708: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:&#8211; &#8216;What a long  tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).&#8217;  I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I went to the Prophet and gave the  pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the  Prophet who remarked, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  manumit him for Allah&#8217;s Sake,&#8221; and so I freed him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 709: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave came intending to  embrace Islam, they lost each other on the way. (When the slave showed up) Abu Huraira  said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I make you witness that the slave is free for Allah&#8217;s  Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 710: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad bin Abi  Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody, telling him that the  boy was his own (illegal) son. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle went (to Mecca) at the time of the  Conquest, Sad took the son of the slavegirl of Zam&#8217;a to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also brought  &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a with him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is the son of my brother  &#8216;Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam&#8217;a&#8217; slave-girl and he was born on his  bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and noticed much  resemblance (to &#8216;Utba). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a as he  was born on the bed of your father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to  observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy&#8217;s resemblance to &#8216;Utba and  Sauda was the wife of the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her  Wala&#8217; would be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), &#8220;Manumit her  as her Wala&#8217; will be for the one who pays the price.&#8221; So, I manumitted her. The  Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either staying with her husband or  leaving him. She said, &#8220;Even if he gave me so much money, I would not stay with  him,&#8221; and so she preferred her freedom to her husband. </font></p>

When he embraced Islam he again slaughtered  one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred slaves. Hakim said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in  the prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of righteousness?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;You have embraced Islam along with all those good deeds you did.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet and they requested him to return their properties and captives. The Prophet stood  up and said to them, &#8220;I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the  most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the  prisoners as I have delayed their distribution.&#8221; The Prophet had waited for them for  more than ten days since his arrival from Ta&#8217;if. So, when it became evident to them that  the Prophet was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, &#8220;We choose  our prisoners.&#8221; The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah  as He deserved and said, &#8220;Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with  repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you  likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his  share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then  he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives).&#8221; The people unanimously said,  &#8220;We do that (return the captives) willingly.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;We do not  know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders  forward us your decision.&#8221; So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter  with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly  given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about the captives  of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that &#8216;Abbas said to the Prophet, &#8220;I paid for my ransom and  Aqil&#8217;s ransom.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Aun: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my  letter that the Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they  were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting  men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives; the Prophet got  Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn &#8216;Umar had told him the above narration and that  Ibn &#8216;Umar was in that army. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu  Said said, &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Barli Al-Mustaliq and we  captured some of the &#8216;Arabs as captives, and the long separation from our wives was  pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus interruptus. We asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle  (whether it was permissible). He said, &#8220;It is better for you not to do so. No soul,  (that which Allah has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will  definitely come, into existence.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever  since I heard, three things, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, These  people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; When the  Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;These are the  Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) of our folk.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had a slave-girl from that  tribe, and the Prophet said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael  (the Prophet).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ma&#8217;rur bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave,  too, was wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing similar  cloaks). He replied, &#8220;Once I abused a man and he complained of me to the Prophet .  The Prophet asked me, &#8216;Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?&#8217; He added, &#8216;Your slaves  are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one&#8217;s brethren  under one&#8217;s control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them  with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot  bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You should not say, &#8216;Feed your lord  (Rabbaka), help your lord in performing ablution, or give water to your lord, but should  say, &#8216;my master (e.g. Feed your master instead of lord etc.) (Saiyidi), or my guardian  (Maulai), and one should not say, my slave (Abdi), or my girl-slave (Amati), but should  say, my lad (Fatai), my lass (Fatati), and &#8216;my boy (Ghulami).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When your servant brings your meals  to you then if he does not let him sit and share the meals, then he should at least give  him a mouthful or two mouthfuls of that meal or a meal or two meals, as he has prepared  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in  her writing of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid anything of  it. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go back to your masters, and if they agree that I will pay  the amount of your writing of emancipation and get your Wala&#8217;, I will do so.&#8221; Buraira  informed her masters of that but they refused and said, &#8220;If she (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) is  seeking Allah&#8217;s reward, then she can do so, but your Wala&#8217; will be for us.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said to her, &#8220;Buy and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217;  is for the liberator.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and said, &#8220;What about the  people who stipulate conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever imposes  conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions will be invalid,  even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Allah&#8217;s conditions (Laws) are the  truth and are more solid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha wanted to buy a slave-girl in order to manumit her.  The girl&#8217;s masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; would be for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to  &#8216;Aisha), &#8220;What they stipulate should not stop you, for the Wala&#8217; is for the  liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Buraira came (to &#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;I have made a  contract of emancipation with my masters for nine Uqiyas (of gold) to be paid in yearly  installments. Therefore, I seek your help.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If your masters agree,  I will pay them the sum at once and free you on condition that your Wala&#8217; will be for  me.&#8221; Buraira went to her masters but they refused that offer. She (came back) and  said, &#8220;I presented to them the offer but they refused, unless the Wala&#8217; was for  them.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard of that and asked me about it, and I told him about it.  On that he said, &#8220;Buy and manumit her and stipulate that the Wala&#8217; should be for you,  as Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up  amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah, and said, &#8216;Then after: What about some  people who impose conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? So, any condition  which is not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions.  Allah&#8217;s ordinance is the truth, and Allah&#8217;s condition is stronger and more solid. Why do  some men from you say, O so-and-so! manumit the slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily,  the Wala is for the liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to &#8216;Aisha and said, &#8220;I was the slave of Utba  bin Abu Lahab. &#8220;Utba died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr  who manumitted me. The sons of &#8216;Utba stipulated that my Wala&#8217; should be for them.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Buraira came to me and she was given the writing of emancipation by her  masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that  her masters would not sell her unless her Wala&#8217; was for them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I  am not in need of that.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that, or he was told about it, he  asked &#8216;Aisha about it. &#8216;Aisha mentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet said,  &#8220;Buy and manumit her and let them stipulate whatever they like.&#8221; So, &#8216;Aisha  bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; should be for  them.&#8221; The Prophet;, said, &#8220;The Wala&#8217; will be for the liberator even if they  stipulated a hundred conditions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.685">Volume 3, Book 45, Number 685: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No doubt, the Prophet mortgaged his armor for barley grams.  Once I took barley bread with some dissolved fat on it to the Prophet and I heard him  saying, &#8220;The household of Muhammad did not possess except a Sa (of food grain,  barley, etc.) for both the morning and the evening meals although they were nine  houses.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet bought some foodstuff on credit for a limited  period and mortgaged his armor for it. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.687"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 687: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who would kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf as he has harmed Allah and His Apostle ?&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and)  said, &#8220;I will kill him.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka&#8217;b and said, &#8220;I  want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Mortgage your women  to me.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women, and you are  the most handsome among the Arabs?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then mortgage your sons to  me.&#8221; Muhammad said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them  for being mortgaged for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as  promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 688: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;One can ride the mortgaged animal  because of what one spends on it, and one can drink the milk of a milch animal as long as  it is mortgaged. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 689: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The mortgaged animal can be  used for riding as long as it is fed and the milk of the milch animal can be drunk  according to what one spend on it. The one who rides the animal or drinks its milk should  provide the expenditures.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 691: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I wrote a letter to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and he wrote to me that the  Prophet had given the verdict that the defendant had to take an oath. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 692: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud) said, &#8220;Whoever took a false oath  in order to grab somebody&#8217;s property will meet Allah while Allah will be angry with  him.&#8221; Allah revealed the following verse to confirm that:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who  purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant And their oaths&#8230;a painful  torment.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu  Abdur-Rehman (i.e. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) was telling you.&#8221; We related the story to him. On that  he said, &#8220;He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute  with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to me), &#8220;Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the  defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).&#8217; I said, &#8216;The defendant  would not mind to take a false oath.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Whoever took a  false oath in order to grab someone else&#8217;s property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry  with him.&#8217; Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath then recited the  following Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!&#8217; (3.77) (See  Hadith No. 546) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army towards the east coast  and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of  three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food  was about to finish. Abu- &#8216;Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was  collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu &#8216;Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration  in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be  one date only.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How could one date benefit you?&#8221; Jabir replied,  &#8220;We came to know its value when even that too finished.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;When  we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate  from it for eighteen days. Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they  were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under  the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the journey food diminished and the people were  reduced to poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their  camels, and he agreed. &#8216;Umar met them and they told him about it, and he said, &#8220;How  would you survive after slaughtering your camels?&#8221; Then he went to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their  camels?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Call upon the people to bring what has  remained of their food.&#8221; A leather sheet was spread and al I the journey food was  collected and heaped over it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and  then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it  till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;I  testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to offer the &#8216;Asr prayer with the Prophet and  slaughter a camel, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would eat the  cooked meat before sunset. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 666: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When the people of Ash&#8217;ari tribe  ran short of food during the holy battles, or the food of their families in Medina ran  short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it  among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl. So, these people are from me, and I  am from them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 667: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq wrote to him the law of Zakat which  was made obligatory by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He wrote: &#8216;Partners possessing joint property  (sheep) have to pay its Zakat equally. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abaya bin Rafa&#8217;a bin Raft&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather said, &#8220;We were in the company of the  Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as  booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and slaughtered the animals and  put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots  to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as  equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were  exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and  Allah stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Some of these animals are like  wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e.  shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather  said, &#8220;We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the  animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Use whatever causes blood to flow, and  eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not  slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones  (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we  should not imitate for they are infidels).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet decreed that one should not eat two dates  together at a time unless he gets the permission from his companions (sharing the meal  with him). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.670"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;While at Medina we were struck with famine. Ibn  Az-Zubair used to provide us with dates as our food. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by us and say,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat two dates together at a time as the Prophet has forbidden eating two dates  together at a time (in a gathering) unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companion  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If one  manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other  shares according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be completely  manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.&#8217; &#8221; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator is  not sure whether the saying &#8221; &#8230; otherwise he will be partially manumitted&#8221; was  said by Nafi&#8217; or the Prophet.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 672: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely  by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him,  then the price of the slave should be estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work  and earn the amount that will manumit him (without overburdening him)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 673: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the  example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats  in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water, they had to  go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, &#8216;Let us make a hole in  our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them.  So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the  people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be  safe.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.674"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 674: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he had asked &#8216;Aisha about the meaning of the Statement  of Allah: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan  girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four.&#8221; (4.3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, &#8220;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl  who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him  to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been  given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls  unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were  ordered to marry any other woman.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;After that verse the  people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan &#8216;girls), so Allah revealed  the following verses:&#8211; &#8216;They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah  Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The  orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to  marry&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What is meant by Allah&#8217;s Saying:&#8211; &#8216;And about what is  Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:&#8211; &#8216;If you fear that you shall not Be able  to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.&#8217; (4.3)  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s saying in the other verse:&#8211;&#8216;Yet whom you desire to marry&#8217;  (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision  when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The  guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty  without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are  neither beautiful nor wealthy).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet established the right of Shu&#8217;fa (i.e.  Pre-emption) in joint properties; but when the land is divided and the ways are  demarcated, then there is no pre-emption. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The right of pre-emption is valid  in every joint property, but when the land is divided and the way is demarcated, then  there is no right of pre-emption.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand.  He said, &#8220;I and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on  credit.&#8221; Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He replied, &#8220;I  and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went to the Prophet and asked him  about it. He said, &#8216;Take what was from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his mother Zainab bint Humaid took him to the Prophet  and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take the pledge of allegiance from him.&#8221; But he  said, &#8220;He is still too young for the pledge,&#8221; and passed his hand on his (i.e.  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) head and invoked for Allah&#8217;s blessing for him. Zuhra bin Ma&#8217;bad stated that  he used to go with his grandfather, &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff.  Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, &#8220;Be our partner, as the  Prophet invoked Allah to bless you.&#8221; So, he would be their partner, and very often he  would win a camel&#8217;s load and send it home. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has  sufficient money.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in  the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived  at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra and that  we could finish our Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual  intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, &#8220;Shall we  go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?&#8221; Jabir moved his hand while  saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;I have  been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you  do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have  brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have  finished the Ihram.&#8221; At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?&#8221; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;It is forever.&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was  saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, &#8216;Ali was  saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s). The Prophet told him to keep on the  Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;We were in the  valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and  sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat  in the pots and started cooking. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots,  and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels  fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and)  a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Some of these  animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then  you should treat it as you have done now.&#8217; &#8221; My grandfather said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we  slaughter the animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, or you can use what  would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of  Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don&#8217;t use teeth or fingernails (in  slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used  by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668) </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 43:</p>
<h3 align="center">Oppressions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.043.620"></a>Volume 3, Book 43, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the believers pass safely over (the bridge across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection . &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 624:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing others.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;The Prophet orders us to do seven things and prohibited us from doing seven other things.&#8221; Then Al-Bara&#8217; mentioned the following:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) to follow funeral processions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) to say to a sneezer, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you&#8221; (if he says, &#8220;Praise be to Allah!&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) to return greetings,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) to help the oppressed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) to accept invitations,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) to help others to fulfill their oaths. (See Hadith No. 753, Vol. 7)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.&#8221; The Prophet then clasped his hands with the fingers interlaced (while saying that).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 629:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever has oppressed another person concerning his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him before the Day of Resurrection when there will be no money (to compensate for wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good deeds will be taken from him according to his oppression which he has done, and if he has no good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person will be loaded on him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the explanation of the following verse:&#8211; &#8220;If a wife fears Cruelty or desertion On her husband&#8217;s part.&#8221; (4.128) A man may dislike his wife and intend to divorce her, so she says to him, &#8220;I give up my rights, so do not divorce me.&#8221; The above verse was revealed concerning such a case.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who drank some of it. A boy was sitting to his right, and some old men to his left. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the boy, &#8220;Do you allow me to give the rest of the drink to these people?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then handed the bowl (of drink) to the boy. (See Hadith No. 541).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 632:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there was a dispute between him and some people (about a piece of land). When he told &#8216;Aisha about it, she said, &#8220;O Abu Salama! Avoid taking the land unjustly, for the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever usurps even one span of the land of somebody, his neck will be encircled with it down the seven earths.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 634:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a piece of the land of others unjustly, he will sink down the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 635:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were in Medina with some of the Iraqi people, and we were struck with famine and Ibn Az-Zubair used to give us dates. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by and say, &#8220;The Prophet forbade us to eat two dates at a time, unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companions.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 636:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an Ansari man called Abu Shu&#8217;aib who had a slave butcher. Abu Shu&#8217;aib said to him, &#8220;Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so he invited him. Another man who was not invited, followed the Prophet. The Prophet said to Abu Shu&#8217;aib, &#8220;This man has followed us. Do you allow him to share the meal?&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 637:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most hated person in the sight of Allah is the most quarrelsome person.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 638:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard some people quarreling at the door of his dwelling. He came out and said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 639:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has (the following) four characters will be a hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up. These are: (1 ) Whenever he talks, he tells a lie; (2) whenever he makes a promise, he breaks it; (3) whenever he makes a covenant he proves treacherous; (4) and whenever he quarrels, he behaves impudently in an evil insulting manner.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 33 Vol. 1)</p>

I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets of Medina. Some people said, &#8220;Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs.&#8221; On that the Divine revelation came:&#8211; &#8220;On those who believe And do good deeds There is no blame For what they ate (in the past).&#8221; (5.93)</p>

Avoid sitting on he roads (ways).&#8221; The people said, &#8220;There is no way out of it as these are our sitting places where we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you must sit there, then observe the rights of the way.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What are the rights of the way?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil.&#8221;</p>

Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, &#8220;This dog is suffering from thirst as I did.&#8221; So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving the animals?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 551)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of one of the castles (or higher buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? No doubt I am seeing the spots of afflictions amongst your houses as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall (during a heavy rain). (See Hadith No. 102)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.608">Volume 3, Book 42, Number 608: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to  the Prophet (and informed him about it), he said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it  for one year&#8221; I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it, so I again went to the  Prophet who said, &#8220;Make public announcement for another year.&#8221; I did, but none  turned up to claim it. I went to him for the third time and he said, &#8220;Keep the  container and the string which is used for its tying and count the money it contains and  if its owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub-narrator Salama said, &#8220;I met him (Suwaid,  another sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know whether Ubai made the  announcement for three years or just one year.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking  up a lost thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year.  Remember the description of its container and the string with which it is tied; and if  somebody comes and claims it and describes it correctly, (give it to him); otherwise,  utilize it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the  wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; On that the face of the  Prophet became red (with anger) and said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it, as it has  its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat trees.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Yazid Maula Al-Munba&#8217;ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham  saying, &#8220;The Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, &#8216;Remember the description of  its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly for one year.&#8217;  &#8221; Yazid added, &#8220;If nobody claims then the person who has found it can spend it,  and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to him.&#8221; Yahya said, &#8220;I do not know  whether the last sentences were said by the Prophet or by Yazid.&#8221; Zaid further said,  &#8220;The Prophet was asked, &#8216;What about a lost sheep?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Take it, for it  is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf.&#8221; Yazid added that it  should also be announced publicly. The man then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The  Prophet said, &#8220;Leave it, as it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will  reach a place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came and asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about picking a lost  thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Remember the description of its container and the string it  is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one year. If the owner shows up,  give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with it.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;What  about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e.  its owner), or for the wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;It is none of your concern. It has its water-container (reservoir)  and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat the trees till its owner finds  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.612"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 612: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have  eaten it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Sometimes  when I return home and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but  I fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.613"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 613: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of  Mecca, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, said,  &#8220;Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority to His Apostle and  the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for anyone before me, and was made legal  for me for a part of a day, and it will not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should  not be chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its fallen things  is not allowed except for one who makes public announcement for it, and he whose relative  is murdered has the option either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate.&#8221;  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir.&#8221; Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get it written for me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Write it for Abu Shah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator asked Al-Auza&#8217;i): What did he mean by  saying, &#8220;Get it written, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The speech which  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.614"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 614: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;An animal should not be milked  without the permission of its owner. Does any of you like that somebody comes to his store  and breaks his container and takes away his food? The udders of the animals are the stores  of their owners where their provision is kept, so nobody should milk the animals of  somebody else, without the permission of its owner.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Luqata. He said,  &#8220;Make public announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its  container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if its owner comes back  after that, give it to him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a  lost sheep?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Take it, for it is for you, for your  brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost  camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said,  &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its  owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 616: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Suwaid bin Ghafala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I as in the company of Salman bin Rabi&#8217;a and Suhan,  in one of the holy battles, I found a whip. One of them told me to drop it but I refused  to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found him, otherwise I would  utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin  Ka&#8217;b about it. He said, &#8220;I found a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of  the Prophet and took it to the Prophet who said to me, &#8216;Make public announcement about it  for one year.&#8217; So, I announced it for one year and went to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Announce  it publicly for another year.&#8217; So, I announced it for another year. I went to him again  and he said, &#8220;Announce for an other year.&#8221; So I announced for still another  year. I went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, &#8216;Remember the amount of  money, the description of its container and the string it is tied with, and if the owner  comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>the above narration (Hadith 616) from Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b:  adding, &#8220;I met the sub-narrator at Mecca later on, but he did not remember whether  Ka&#8217;b had announced what he had found one year or three years.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.618"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 618: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin asked the Prophet about the Luqata. The Prophet  said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year and if then somebody comes and  describes the container of the Luqata and the string it was tied with, (give it to him);  otherwise, spend it.&#8221; He then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The face of the  Prophet become red and he said, &#8220;You have o concern with it as it has its water  reservoir and feet and it will reach water and drink and eat trees. Leave it till its  owner finds it.&#8221; He then asked the Prophet about a lost sheep. The Prophet said,  &#8220;It is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.619"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 619: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was on my way, all of a sudden I saw a shepherd  driving his sheep, I asked him whose servant he was. He replied that he was the servant of  a man from Quraish, and then he mentioned his name and I recognized him. I asked, &#8220;Do  your sheep have some milk?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8220;Are you  going to milk for me?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I ordered him and he tied the  legs of one of the sheep. Then I told him to clean the udder (teats) of dust and to remove  dust off his hands. He removed the dust off his hands by clapping his hands. He then  milked a little milk. I put the milk for Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a pot and closed its mouth  with a piece of cloth and poured water over it till it became cold. I took it to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He drank it till I was pleased. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the company of the Prophet in one of his  Ghazawat, he asked, &#8220;What is wrong with your camel? Will you sell it?&#8221; I replied  in the affirmative and sold it to him. When he reached Medina, I took the camel to him in  the morning and he paid me its price. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Amash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we were with Ibrahim, we talked about mortgaging in  deals of Salam. Ibrahim narrated from Aswad that &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8220;The Prophet bought  some foodstuff on credit from a Jew and mortgaged an iron armor to him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 572: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes the money of the  people with the intention of repaying it, Allah will repay it on his behalf, and whoever  takes it in order to spoil it, then Allah will spoil him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 573: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the  mountain of Uhud and said, &#8220;I would not like to have this mountain turned into gold  for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me for more than  three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Allah&#8217;s Cause), except that Dinar which I will  keep for repaying debts.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Those who are rich in this world would  have little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in  Allah&#8217;s Cause), and they are few in number.&#8221; Then he ordered me to stay at my place  and went not far away. I heard a voice and intended to go to him but I remembered his  order, &#8220;Stay at your place till I return.&#8221; On his return I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! (What was) that noise which I heard?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you hear  anything?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Gabriel came and said to me,  &#8216;Whoever amongst your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter  Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even if he stole  or committed illegal sexual intercourse)&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I had gold equal to the  mountain of Uhud, it would not please me that it should remain with me for more than three  days, except an amount which I would keep for repaying debts.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 575: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man demanded his debts from Allah&#8217;s Apostle in such a  rude manner that the companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but the Prophet said,  &#8220;Leave him, no doubt, for he (the creditor) has the right to demand it (harshly). Buy  a camel and give it to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The camel that is available is older  than the camel he demands. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;Buy it and give it to him, for  the best among you are those who repay their debts handsomely. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 576: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Once a man died and was  asked, &#8216;What did you use to say (or do) (in your life time)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I was a  business-man and used to give time to the rich to repay his debt and (used to) deduct part  of the debt of the poor.&#8217; So he was forgiven (his sins.)&#8221; Abu Masud said, &#8220;I  heard the same (Hadith) from the Prophet.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 577: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and demanded a camel (the Prophet  owed him). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to give him (a camel). They said, &#8220;We  do not find except an older camel (than what he demands). (The Prophet ordered them to  give him that camel). The man said, &#8220;You have paid me in full and may Allah also pay  you in full.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give him, for the best amongst the people  is he who repays his debts in the most handsome manner.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 578: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet owed a camel of a certain age to a man who came  to demand it back. The Prophet ordered his companions to give him. They looked for a camel  of the same age but found nothing but a camel one year older. The Prophet told them to  give it to him. The man said, &#8220;You have paid me in full, and may Allah pay you in  full.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The best amongst you is he who pays his debts in the  most handsome manner.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 579: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet while he was in the Mosque. (Mis&#8217;ar  thinks, that Jabir went in the forenoon.) After the Prophet told me to pray two Rakat, he  repayed me the debt he owed me and gave me an extra amount. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.041.580"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 580: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud,  and he was in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to the  Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the fruits of my garden and  exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give  them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early  in the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I  then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for  us. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.041.581"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 581: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates).  I requested him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to the Jew and asked him to accept  the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered  the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying),  &#8220;Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due.&#8221; So, I plucked the fruits for him  after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen  Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to inform of what had  happened, but found him praying the &#8216;Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the  extra fruits which remained. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me to inform (Umar) Ibn Al-Khatab about  it. When I went to &#8216;Umar and told him about it, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle  walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 582: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to invoke Allah in the prayer saying,  &#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge with you from all sins, and from being in debt.&#8221; Someone  said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (I see you) very often you seek refuge with Allah from being in  debt. He replied, &#8220;If a person is in debt, he tells lies when he speaks, and breaks  his promises when he promises.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 583: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If someone leaves some property, it  will be for the inheritors, and if he leaves some weak offspring, it will be for us to  support them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.041.584"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 584: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am closer to the believers than  their selves in this world and in the Hereafter, and if you like, you can read Allah&#8217;s  Statement: &#8220;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.&#8221;  (33.6) So, if a true believer dies and leaves behind some property, it will be for his  inheritors (from the father&#8217;s side), and if he leaves behind some debt to be paid or needy  offspring, then they should come to me as I am the guardian of the deceased.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and demanded his debts and used  harsh words. The companions of the Prophet wanted to harm him, but the Prophet said,  &#8220;Leave him, as the creditor (owner of the right) has the right to speak.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 41, Number 589: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died, he left behind children  and debts. I asked the lenders to put down some of his debt, but they refused, so I went  to the Prophet to intercede with them, yet they refused. The Prophet said (to me),  &#8220;Classify your dates into their different kinds: &#8216;Adhq bin Zaid, Lean and &#8216;Ajwa, each  kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you.&#8221; I did so and the  Prophet came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid  them fully, and the amount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched  them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among  with the Prophet and I was riding one of our camels. The camel got tired and was lagging  behind the others. The Prophet hit it on its back. He said, &#8220;Sell it to me, and you  have the right to ride it till Medina.&#8221; When we approached Medina, I took the permission  from the Prophet to go to my house, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have newly  married.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or  divorcee)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have married a matron, as &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died and  left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a matron who may teach them and  bring them up with good manners.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to me), &#8220;Go to your  family.&#8221; When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling of the camel,  he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and about  what the Prophet had done to the camel and his hitting it. When the Prophet arrived, I  went to him with the camel in the morning and he gave me its price, the camel itself, and  my share from the war booty as he gave the other people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden for you, (1) to  be undutiful to your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters alive, (3) to not to pay the  rights of the others (e.g. charity, etc.) and (4) to beg of men (begging).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Everyone of you is a  guardian, and responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his  subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his family and is  responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s house and is responsible for it,  and a servant is a guardian of his master&#8217;s property and is responsible for it.&#8221; I  heard that from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I think that the Prophet also said, &#8220;A man is a  guardian of is father&#8217;s property and is responsible for it, so all of you are guardians  and responsible for your wards and things under your care.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard a man reciting a verse (of the Holy Qur&#8217;an) but I  had heard the Prophet reciting it differently. So, I caught hold of the man by the hand  and took him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8220;Both of you are right.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba, the  sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think he said to them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t differ, for the nations  before you differed and perished (because of their differences). &#8221; </font></p>

The Jew said,  &#8220;By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the people!&#8221; At that the Muslim  raised his hand and slapped the Jew on the face. The Jew went to the Prophet and informed  him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet sent for the Muslim and  asked him about it. The Muslim informed him of the event. The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not  give me superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall  unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the first to gain consciousness, and  will see Moses standing and holding the side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know  whether (Moses) has also fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted  him from that stroke.&#8221; </font></p>

One of your companions has slapped me on my face.&#8221; The Prophet  asked who that was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet sent for him, and  on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He (replied in the affirmative  and) said, &#8220;I heard him taking an oath in the market saying, &#8216;By Him Who gave Moses  superiority over all the human beings.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses  superiority) even over Muhammad I became furious </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>and slapped him over his face.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do not give a prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all  the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth, and  will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether  Moses has fallen unconscious or the first unconsciousness was sufficient for him.&#8221; </font></p>

I had common land  with a Jew, and the Jew later on denied my ownership, so I took him to the Prophet who  asked me whether I had a proof of my ownership. When I replied in the negative, the  Prophet asked the Jew to take an oath. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He will take an  oath and deprive me of my property.&#8221; So, Allah revealed the following verse:  &#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant and their  oaths.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>

When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed  in this way.&#8221; He then asked me to recite it. When I recited it, he said, &#8220;It was  revealed in this way.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw some agricultural equipments and said: &#8220;I heard  the Prophet saying: &#8220;There is no house in which these equipment enters except that  Allah will cause humiliation to enter it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Abu Zuhair, a man from Azd Shanu&#8217;a and one  of the companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If one keeps  a dog which is meant for guarding neither a farm nor cattle, one Qirat of the reward of  his good deeds is deducted daily.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you hear this from Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, by the Lord of this Mosque.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it  turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I  have been created for sloughing.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the  shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when  there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said,  &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221; (It has been written that a wolf  also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in  Fatah-al-Bari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was  amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its  tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be  busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has  provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have  never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There  is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those  palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said,  &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced  Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 518: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said to the Prophet &#8220;Distribute the date  palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The  Ansar said (to the emigrants), &#8220;Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share  the fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We listen and obey.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 519: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of  Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin  Thabit said in a poetic verse: &#8220;The chiefs of Bani Lu&#8217;ai found it easy to watch fire  spreading at Al-Buwaira.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 520: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the  landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the  rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold  or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get  so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both  spend on it and the yield is divided between them.&#8221; Az-Zuhri had the same opinion.  Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half  the yield.&#8221; Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, &#8216;Ata&#8217;, Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said,  &#8220;There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis  that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver  for his labor.&#8221; Ma&#8217;am said, &#8220;There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite  (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the  animals is given to the owner of the animals.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 521: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar  to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would  be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of  dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When &#8216;Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the  Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the  previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and &#8216;Aisha chose  the land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 522: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that  they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.523"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 523: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Tawus, &#8220;I wish you would give up Mukhabara  (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it.&#8221; On that Tawus  replied, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most  learned man, namely Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, &#8216;It  is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one&#8217;s brother than to charge him a  fixed rental.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.524"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 524: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew&#8217;s on  the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.525"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 525: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land and say to the owner, &#8220;The yield of this portion is for us and  the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent).&#8221; One of those portions might  yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.526"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 526: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three men were walking, It  started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled  down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other,  &#8220;Think of good deeds which you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving  reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you.&#8221; One of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On  my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my  parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and  found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated  to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children  were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this  for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.&#8217; So,  Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I was  in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted  to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I  struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).&#8217; So, I  got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted  a little more. Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice  and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused  to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from  the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, &#8216;Fear Allah (and give me my  right).&#8221; I said, &#8216;Go and take those cows and the shepherd.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Be afraid of  Allah! Don&#8217;t mock at me.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).&#8217; So, he took  all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.&#8217;  So, Allah removed the rock.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who cultivates land that does  not belong to anybody is more rightful (to own it).&#8221; &#8216;Urwa said, &#8220;Umar gave the  same verdict in his Caliphate.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of  rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said  to him, &#8220;You are in a blessed valley.&#8221; Musa said, &#8220;Salim let our camels  kneel at the place where &#8216;Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the  bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in Al-&#8216;Aqiq he said, &#8220;Someone  (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, &#8216;Offer the  prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj  (together).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land  became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to  expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they  would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told them, &#8220;We will  let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.&#8221; So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on  living there until &#8216;Umar forced them to go towards Taima&#8217; and Ariha&#8217;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Zuhair said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade us to  do a thing which was a source of help to us.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said was right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me and asked, &#8216;What are you  doing with your farms?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the  yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for  some Wasqs of barley and dates.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not do so, but cultivate (the  land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;We hear and obey.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to rent their land for cultivation for  one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it  uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever  has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise  he should keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 534: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi &#8216;bin  Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, &#8220;It is permissible to rent the land for  cultivation, for Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had  better give the land to one&#8217;s brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 535: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr,  &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi  &#8216;bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar went to Rafi&#8217;  and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the  renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You know that we used to rent our farms in the  life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and  for certain amount of figs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 536: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I knew that the land was  rented for cultivation in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Later on Ibn &#8216;Umar was  afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up  renting his land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 537: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;My two uncles told me that they  (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet  for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield  stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it.&#8221; I said to Rafi,  &#8220;What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There is  no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, &#8220;If those who have discernment  for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden  concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 538: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin  was sitting with him. &#8220;One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him  to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, &#8216;Are you not living in the pleasures you like?&#8217;  He will say, &#8216;Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;When  the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get  ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.  Allah will then say to him, &#8216;O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing  satisfies you.&#8217; &#8221; On that, the bedouin said, &#8220;The man must be either from  Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not  farmers.&#8221; The Prophet smiled (at this). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 539: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to  cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water  streams, and cook them in a pot of her&#8217;s, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya&#8217;qub,  the sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain  fat or melted fat (taken from meat).&#8221;) When we offered the Friday prayer we would go  to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of  that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e.  Friday prayer) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 540: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many  narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, &#8220;Why  do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?&#8221; In fact, my emigrant brethren  were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I  was a poor man keeping the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled  my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were  absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it  on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement.&#8221; So, I spread my covering  sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I  gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle) with the truth,  since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of  mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah&#8217;s Book, I would never have related any  narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): &#8220;Verily! Those who conceal the  clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down &#8230;..(up to) the Merciful.&#8217;  (2.159-160) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the  tribe of Bani Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abu bin &#8216;Adi as a guide. He was an expert  guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by with the tribe of Al-&#8216;Asi  bin Wail and he was on the religion of Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had  confidence in him and gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave  of Thaur after three days.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the  Prophet and in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who  quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other&#8217;s finger and caused his  own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet  cancelled the suit and said to the complainant, &#8220;Did you expect him to let his finger  in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Juraij from Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from his  grandfather a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own tooth to  fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for compensation (for the broken  tooth). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Your example and the example of the  people of the two Scriptures (i.e. Jews and Christians) is like the example of a man who  employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work for me from morning till midday for  one Qirat?&#8217; The Jews accepted and carried out the work. He then asked, Who will work for  me from midday up to the &#8216;Asr prayer for one Qirat?&#8217; The Christians accepted and fulfilled  the work. He then said, &#8216;Who will work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset for two Qirats?&#8217;  You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;Why  should we work more and get lesser wages?&#8217; (Allah) said, &#8216;Have I with-held part of your  right?&#8217; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;It is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever  I wish .&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 470: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;I will be an opponent  to three types of people on the Day of Resurrection: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but proves  treacherous; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. One who sells a free person and eats his price; and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. One who employs a laborer and takes full work from him  but does not pay him for his lab our.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 471: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of Muslims, Jews and  Christians is like the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning  till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and then said, &#8216;We do not need your  money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be annulled.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Don&#8217;t quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.&#8217; But  they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them,  &#8216;Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first  batch.&#8217; So, they worked till the time of &#8216;Asr prayer. Then they said, &#8220;Let what we  have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,&#8217; but they  refused. Thereafter he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they  worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two  former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the example of this  light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 472: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Three men from among  those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered  it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to  each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda  to the righteous deed which you have done (for Allah&#8217;s sake only).&#8217; So, one of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk  before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had  slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I  disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of  milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then  they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve  us from our critical situation caused by this rock.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little but  they could not get out.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I  had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations  with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me  and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my  desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for  you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have  sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to  me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only,  please relieve us from the present calamity.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little more but still  they could not get out from there.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah!  I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did  not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby.  (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah&#8217;s slave! Pay me my wages. I said to  him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah&#8217;s slave!  Don&#8217;t mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them  away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from  the present suffering.&#8217; So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a blacksmith and did some work for Al-&#8216;As bin Wail.  When he owed me some money for my work, I went to him to ask for that amount. He said,  &#8220;I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah!  I will never do that till you die and be resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Will I be dead  and then resurrected after my death?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There I  will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due.&#8221; Then Allah  revealed. &#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; (19.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey  till they reached some of the &#8216;Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them  as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or  stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said  (to the others), &#8220;Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided  here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment),&#8221;  They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;Our chief has  been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has  not benefitted. Have you got anything (useful)?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by  Allah! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will  not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it.&#8221; They agrees to  pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): &#8216;All the  praises are for the Lord of the Worlds&#8217; and puffed over the chief who became all right as  if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of  sickness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e.  the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who  performed the recitation said, &#8220;Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and  narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order.&#8221; So, they went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and narrated the story. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;How did you come to know that  Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;You have done the right  thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.&#8221; The Prophet  smiled thereupon. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I  used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be  present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my  Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of  Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle once said, &#8220;Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present  speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say.&#8221; So, I  spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his  saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his  grand-father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, &#8220;When we came to Medina as  emigrants, Allah&#8217;s Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad bin  Ar-Rabi&#8217;. Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; said (to me), &#8216;I am the richest among the Ansar, so I will give  you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may  choose I will divorce her, and when she has completed the prescribed period (before  marriage) you may marry her.&#8217; Abdur-Rahman replied, &#8220;I am not in need of all that. Is  there any market-place where trade is practiced?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;The market of  Qainuqa.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day and brought some dried  butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he continued going there regularly. Few days  later, &#8216;AbdurRahman came having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked him whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said,  &#8216;Whom have you married?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;A woman from the Ansar.&#8217; Then the Prophet asked,  &#8216;How much did you pay her?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a  date stone (or a date stone of gold)! The Prophet said, &#8216;Give a Walima (wedding banquet)  even if with one sheep .&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 265: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina, the Prophet  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi al-Ansari. Sad was a  rich man, so he said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I will give you half of my property and will  help you marry.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in your  family and property. Show me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman did not return from the  market) till he gained some dried buttermilk (yoghurt) and butter (through trading). He  brought that to his house-hold. We stayed for some-time (or as long as Allah wished), and  then Abdur-Rahman came, scented with yellowish perfume. The Prophet said (to him)  &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married to an Ansari woman.&#8221; The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What did you pay her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;A gold stone or gold  equal to the weight of a date stone.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Give a wedding  banquet even if with one sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 266: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ukaz, Majanna and Dhul-Majaz were market-places in the  Pre-lslamic period of ignorance. When Islam came, Muslims felt that marketing there might  be a sin. So, the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;There is no harm for you to seek the  bounty of your Lord (in the seasons of Hajj).&#8221; (2.198) Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited the Verse  in this way. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 267: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;Both legal and illegal things are  obvious, and in between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So who-ever forsakes those  doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid what is clearly illegal;  and who-ever indulges in these (suspicious) doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit  what is clearly illegal. Sins are Allah&#8217;s Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures  (his sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 269: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abu Waqqas took a firm promise from his brother  Sad bin Abu Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody as he was  his (i.e. &#8216;Utba&#8217;s) son. In the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad bin Abu Waqqas took  him, and said that he was his brother&#8217;s son, and his brother took a promise from him to  that effect. &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said, &#8220;He is my brother and the son of the  slave-girl of my father and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Then they both went to the  Prophet Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is the son of my brother and he has taken a  promise from me that I will take him.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;(He is) my brother  and the son of my father&#8217;s slave-girl and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;The boy is for you. O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;The son is for the bed (i.e the man on whose bed he was born) and stones  (disappointment and deprivation) for the one who has done illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet told his wife Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to screen herself from that  boy as he noticed a similarity between the boy and &#8216;Utba. So, the boy did not see her till  he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about Al Mirad (i.e. a sharp-edged  piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a piece of iron used for hunting). He  replied, &#8220;If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, and if it is hit by its broad  side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I release my dog by the name of Allah and find with it at the game, another dog  on which I have not mentioned the name of Allah, and I do not know which one of them  caught the game.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to him), &#8216;Don&#8217;t eat it as you have mentioned  the name of Allah on your dog and not on the other dog.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet passed by a fallen date and said, &#8220;Were it  not for my doubt that this might have been given in charity, I would have eaten it.&#8221;  And narrated Abu Huraira the Prophet said, &#8220;I found a date-fruit fallen on my  bed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abbas bin Tamim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his uncle said: &#8220;The Prophet was asked: If a  person feels something during his prayer; should one interrupt his prayer?&#8221; The  Prophet said: No! You should not give it up unless you hear a sound or smell  something.&#8221; Narrated Ibn Abi Hafsa: Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;There is no need of  repeating ablution unless you detect a smell or hear a sound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Meat is brought  to us by some people and we are not sure whether the name of Allah has been mentioned on  it or not (at the time of slaughtering the animals).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to them),  &#8220;Mention the name of Allah and eat it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were offering the prayer with the Prophet a  caravan carrying food came from Sham. The people looked towards the caravan (and went to  it) and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet. So, the Divine Inspiration came;  &#8220;But when they see some bargain or some amusement, they disperse headlong to  it.&#8221; (62.11) </font></p>

They replied, &#8216;We were traders in the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle  about money exchange. He replied, &#8216;If it is from hand to hand, there is no harm in it;  otherwise it is not permissible.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa asked Umar to admit him but he was not admitted as  &#8216;Umar was busy, so Abu Musa went back. When &#8216;Umar finished his job he said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I  hear the voice of &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais? Let him come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar was told that he had  left. So, he sent for him and on his arrival, he (Abu Musa) said, &#8220;We were ordered to  do so (i.e. to leave if not admitted after asking permission thrice). &#8216;Umar told him,  &#8220;Bring witness in proof of your statement.&#8221; Abu Musa went to the Ansar&#8217;s meeting  places and asked them. They said, &#8220;None amongst us will give this witness except the  youngest of us, Abu Said Al-Khudri. Abu Musa then took Abu Said Al-Khudri (to &#8216;Umar) and  &#8216;Umar said, surprisingly, &#8220;Has this order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle been hidden from  me?&#8221; (Then he added), &#8220;I used to be busy trading in markets.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached before me and I reached in the morning,  and when I went to the mosque, I found him at the door of the mosque.

Nawwas asked him, &#8220;To whom have you sold them?&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;To such and such Sheikh.&#8221; Nawwas said, &#8220;Woe to you; By Allah,  that Sheikh was Ibn &#8216;Umar.&#8221; Nawwas then went to Ibn &#8216;Umar and said to him, &#8220;My  partner sold you camels suffering from the disease of excessive thirst and he had not  known you.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar told him to take them back. When Nawwas went to take them, Ibn  &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;Leave them there as I am happy with the decision of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle that there is no oppression . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rarely did the Prophet fail to visit Abu Bakr&#8217;s house  everyday, either in the morning or in the evening. When the permission for migration to  Medina was granted, all of a sudden the Prophet came to us at noon and Abu Bakr was  informed, who said, &#8220;Certainly the Prophet has come for some urgent matter.&#8221; The  Prophet said to Abu Bark, when the latter entered &#8220;Let nobody stay in your  home.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There are only my two daughters  (namely &#8216;Aisha and Asma&#8217;) present.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I feel (am informed) that  I have been granted the permission for migration.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I will  accompany you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You will accompany  me.&#8221; Abu Bakr then said &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have two she-camels I have  prepared specially for migration, so I offer you one of them. The Prophet said, &#8220;I  have accepted it on the condition that I will pay its price.&#8221; </font></p>

One of them said, &#8216;O Allah! My  parents were old and I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk  (the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. After they had drunk  from it, I would give it to my children, family and wife. One day I was delayed and on my  return I found my parents sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were  crying at my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it was dawn. O  Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then please remove this rock so that we  may see the sky.&#8217; So, the rock was moved a bit. The second said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I  was in love with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a woman, and  she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars  (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat  in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her  except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I  did if for Your sake, kindly remove this rock.&#8217; So, two-thirds of the rock was removed.  Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one  Faraq (three Sa&#8217;s) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I  sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a shepherd. After a time that man came and  demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for  they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I was not  joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You regard that I did it  sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So, the rock was removed completely  from the mouth of the cave.&#8221; </font></p>

(The king) was told that  Abraham had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming  women. So, the king sent for Abraham and asked, &#8216;O Abraham! Who is this lady accompanying  you?&#8217; Abraham replied, &#8216;She is my sister (i.e. in religion).&#8217; Then Abraham returned to her  and said, &#8216;Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my  sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.&#8217; Then Abraham  sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed  and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private  parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217;  On that the king fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the  condition of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I  have killed him.&#8217; The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up  again and performed ablution, prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and  Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please  do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217; The king again fell in a mood of agitation and  started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he  should die, the people will say that I have killed him.&#8217; The king got either two or three  attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, &#8216;By Allah! You have sent a  satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.&#8217; So she came back to Abraham and said,  &#8216;Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a slavegirl for service.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad bin Abi Waqqas and &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a quarreled over a boy.  Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This boy is the son of my brother (&#8216;Utba bin Abi  Waqqas) who took a promise from me that I would take him as he was his (illegal) son. Look  at him and see whom he resembles.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This  is my brother and was born on my father&#8217;s bed from his slave-girl.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  cast a look at the boy and found definite resemblance to &#8216;Utba and then said, &#8220;The  boy is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a. The child goes to the owner of the bed and the adulterer  gets nothing but the stones (despair, i.e. to be stoned to death). Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;O Sauda bint Zama! Screen yourself from this boy.&#8221; So, Sauda never saw him  again. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221; So, he performed Itikaf for one night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that &#8216;Umar had vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A sub-narrator thinks that &#8216;Umar vowed to perform Itikaf for one night.) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 260:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to perform Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan for ten days, and when it was the year of his death, he stayed in Itikaf for twenty days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman from &#8216;Aisha: Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned that he would practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to perform Itikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked &#8216;Aisha to take his permission for</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha during her menses used to comb and oil the hair of the Prophet while he used to be in Itikaf in the mosque. He would stretch out his head towards her while she was in her chamber.</p>

<h3 align="center">Praying at Night in Ramadaan (Taraweeh)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.032.226"></a>Volume 3, Book 32, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying regarding Ramadan, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night in it (the month of Ramadan) out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221; Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s Caliphate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abdul Qari said, &#8220;I went out in the company of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)&#8217;. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, &#8216;Umar remarked, &#8216;What an excellent Bid&#8217;a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.&#8217; He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray (at night) in Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was informed by &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;How was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in Ramadan?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat &#8212;- let alone their beauty and length&#8212;-and then he would pray four &#8212;-let alone their beauty and length &#8212;-and then he would pray three Rakat (Witr).&#8221; She added, &#8220;I asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the Witr?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever fasted the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith (i.e. belief) and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven .&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some men amongst the companions of the Prophet were shown in their dreams that the night of Qadr was in the last seven nights of Ramadan. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It seems that all your dreams agree that (the Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to search for it (i.e. the Night of Qadr) should search in the last seven (nights of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Sa&#8217;id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, &#8220;We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, &#8216;I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l&#8217;tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day&#8217;s period)&#8217;, and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Search for the Night of Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque) in the middle third of Ramadan and after passing the twenty nights he used to go back to his house on the 21st, and the people who were in Itikaf with him also used to go back to their houses. Once in Ramadan, in which he practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, &#8220;I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet . I saw with my own eyes the Prophet at the completion of the morning prayer leaving with his face covered with mud and water.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Look for (the Night of Qadr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the last ten nights of Ramadan and used to say, &#8220;Look for the Night of Qadr in the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan ,&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Look for the Night of Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadan ,&#8217; on the night when nine or seven or five nights remain out of the last ten nights of Ramadan (i.e. 21, 23, 25, respectively).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Night of Qadr is in the last ten nights of the month (Ramadan), either on the first nine or in the last (remaining) seven nights (of Ramadan).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added, &#8220;Search for it on the twenty-fourth (of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came out to inform us about the Night of Qadr but two Muslims were quarreling with each other. So, the Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramadan).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, the Prophet used to tighten his waist belt (i.e. work hard) and used to pray all the night, and used to keep his family awake for the prayers.</p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Pilgrims Prevented from Completing thePilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi: Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah told him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah) if he had sta</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka&#8217;ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child. (Just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this Ka&#8217;ba and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commit sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a new-born child, (just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>

And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida&#8217;, where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&#8217;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &#8216;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with &#8216;Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both.&#8221; I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, &#8220;Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra.&#8221; So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan&#8217;im. So I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;This &#8216;Umra is instead of your missed one.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hadi.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, &#8216;Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted &#8216;Umra.&#8217; So I told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, &#8216;This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.&#8217; &#8221; I (Shu&#8217;ba) asked, &#8220;Why (did he invite you)?&#8221; He (Abu Jamra) said, &#8220;Because of the dream which I had seen.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ka&#8217;ba was built, the Prophet and Abbas went to bring stones (for its construction). Al Abbas said to the Prophet, &#8220;Take off your waist sheet and put it on your neck.&#8221; (When the Prophet took it off) he fell on the ground with his eyes open towards the sky and said, &#8220;Give me my waist sheet.&#8221; And he covered himself with it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to her, &#8220;Do you know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba, they decreased it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 654:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka&#8217;ba) was part of the Ka&#8217;ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, &#8220;O Aisha! Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

Will you stay in your house in Mecca?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Has &#8216;Aqil left any property or house?&#8221; Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib. Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, &#8220;A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel.&#8221; Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah&#8217;s Statement: &#8220;Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah&#8217;s Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.&#8221; (8.72)</p>

The people put their hands in it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle again said, &#8216;Give me water to drink. So, he drank from that water and then went to the Zam-zam (well) and there the people were offering water to the others and working at it (drawing water from the well). The Prophet then said to them, &#8220;Carry on! You are doing a good deed.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zam-zam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water).&#8221; On saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the year of his Last Hajj and we mended (the Ihram) for &#8216;Umra. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has a Hadi with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and should not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and &#8216;Umra).&#8221; When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said, &#8220;This is in lieu of your missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran ) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and his riding animal entered the house of Ibn &#8216;Umar. He (the son of Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba. I suggest that you should stay here.&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka&#8217;ba, I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done . . . &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After arriving at Mecca, Ibn &#8216;Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;There is a danger of an impending war between them.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The ceremonies of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and &#8216;Umra. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

(The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka&#8217;ba, or performs &#8216;Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; &#8221; (2.158)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He replied, &#8220;Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba till you get clean (from your menses).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(On &#8216;Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for &#8216;Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdul-Malik bin Marwan wrote to Al-Hajjaj that he should follow &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar in all the ceremonies of Hajj. So when it was the Day of &#8216;Arafat (9th of Dhul-Hajja), and after the sun has deviated or has declined from the middle of the sky, I and Ibn &#8216;Umar came and he shouted near the cotton (cloth) tent of Al-Hajjaj, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; Al-Hajjaj came out. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let us proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;Just now?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;Wait for me till I pour water on me (i.e. take a bath).&#8221; So, Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted (and waited) till Al-Hajjaj came out. He was walking between me and my father. I informed Al-Hajjaj, &#8220;If you want to follow the Sunna today, then you should shorten the sermon and then hurry up for the stay (at &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He (Salim) has spoken the truth.&#8221;</p>

Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said, &#8220;My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of &#8216;Arafat, and I saw the Prophet standing in &#8216;Arafat. I said to myself: By Allah he is from the Hums (literally: strictly religious, Quraish were called so, as they used to say, &#8216;We are the people of Allah we shall not go out of the sanctuary).

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the pre-lslamic period of Ignorance, the people used to perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba naked except the Hums; and the Hums were Quraish and their offspring. The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from &#8216;Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa. &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;My father narrated that &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8211;(2.199) &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;They (the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they were sent to &#8216;Arafat (by Allah&#8217;s order).&#8221;</p>

He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa).&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin Abbas) rode behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle.

Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the (&#8216;Isha&#8217;) prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between them (i.e. Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah;- performed the Hajj and we reached Al-Muzdalifa at or about the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two Rakat after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the &#8216;isha&#8217; prayer). (&#8216;Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement &#8216;I think&#8217;, was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by &#8216;Abdu-Rahman). Then &#8216;Abdullah offered two Rakat of &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. When the day dawned, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;The Prophet never offered any prayer at this hour except this prayer at this time and at this place and on this day.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;These two prayers are shifted from their actual times &#8212; the Maghrib prayer (is offered) when the people reached Al-Muzdalifa and the Fajr (morning) prayer at the early dawn.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;I saw the Prophet doing that.&#8221;</p>

So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so.&#8221;</p>

Has the moon set?&#8221; I replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then asked, &#8220;Has the moon set?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So she said that we should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) and then she returned to her dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, &#8220;O you! I think we have come (to Mina) early in the night.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O my son! Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave permission to the women to do so.&#8221;</p>

So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer has become due. The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.&#8217; &#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, &#8220;If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna.&#8221; I do not know which proceeded the other, his (&#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) statement or the departure of &#8216;Uthman .

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada&#8217;) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he performed &#8216;Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year of the Hajj of Al-Harawriya during the rule of Ibn Az-Zubair. Some people said to him, &#8220;It is very likely that there will be a fight among the people, and we are afraid that they might prevent you (from performing Hajj).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle there is a good example for you (to follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I make you witness that I have intended to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; When he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are the same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After that he took a garlanded Hadi (to Mecca) which he bought (on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than that. He did not make legal for himself the things which were illegal for a Muhrim till it was the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his head shaved and slaughtered (the sacrifice) and considered sufficient his first Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa), as a (Sa&#8217;i) for his Hajj and &#8216;Umra both.

And do you know which month is this?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is the forbidden (sacred) month.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;No doubt, Allah made your blood, your properties, and your honor sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: On the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja), the Prophet stood in between the Jamrat during his Hajj which he performed (as in the previous Hadith) and said, &#8220;This is the greatest Day (i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah).&#8221; The Prophet started saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! Be Witness (I have conveyed Your Message).&#8221; He then bade the people farewell. The people said, &#8220;This is Hajjat-al-Wada).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and &#8216;Umra except me.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go to Tan&#8217;im with your brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.&#8221; So I went with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then there is no harm, depart.&#8221; So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa.</p>

I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt about &#8216;Isha&#8217; (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while.

He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; (Different narrators mentioned that) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, &#8220;Halqa Aqra!
