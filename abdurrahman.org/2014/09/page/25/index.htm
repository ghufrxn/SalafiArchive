Chapter 10<br>
Hastening to do Good Deeds</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So hasten towards all that is good&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:148)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Rubb, and for Jannah as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqun (the pious)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:133)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>87.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. A man would be a believer in the morning and turn to disbelief in the evening, or he would be a believer in the evening and turn disbeliever in the morning, and would sell his Faith for worldly goods.&#8221;</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>88.</b> `Uqbah bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Once I performed the &#8216;Asr prayer in Al-Madinah behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got up quickly after finishing the prayer with Taslim, and stepping over the people, went to one of the rooms of his wives. The people were startled at his haste, and when he came out and saw their astonishment at his urgency he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I recalled that there was left with me some gold which was meant for charity; I did not like to keep it any longer, so I gave orders that it should be distributed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    In another narration, Messenger of Allah said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I had left some gold for Sadaqah in the house, and did not wish to keep it overnight&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>89.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> A man, said to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) during the battle of Uhud: &#8220;Tell me where I shall be if I am killed&#8221;. When he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied that he would be in Jannah, the man threw away some dates which he had in his hand and fought until he was killed</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>90.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: There came a man to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, which charity is the most rewardable?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That you should give charity (in a state when you are) healthy and stingy and fear poverty, hoping to become rich (charity in such a state of health and mind is the best). And you must not defer (charity to such a length) that you are about to die and would be saying: &#8216;This is for so-and-so, and this for so-and-so.&#8217; Lo! It has already come into (the possession of) so-and-so&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>91.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took up a sword on the day of the battle of Uhud and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take this sword from me?&#8221;</span> Everyone stretched forth his hand saying: &#8220;I will take it; I will take it&#8221;. He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take it with its full responsibility (i.e., to use it to fight Allah&#8217;s enemies with it)</span>?&#8221; The Companions hesitated. Abu Dujanah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I shall take it;&#8221; and with it he cracked the skulls of the pagans.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>92.</b> Az-Zubair bin `Adi said:<span style="color:#008000;"> We went to Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) and complained to him of suffering at the hands of Al-Hajjaj. He replied: &#8220;Show endurance, for no time will come but will be followed by one worse (than the present one) till you meet your Rubb. I heard this from your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>93.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.&#8221; Then (giving a warning) he said, &#8220;Are you waiting for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion; or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or disease as will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or Ad-Dajjal who is the worst expected absent, or the Hour, and the Hour will be most grievous and most bitter&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>94.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the battle of Khaibar, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I shall hand over this banner to one who loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah will give us victory through him.&#8221;</span> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I had never longed for leadership but that day I expected that I might be called for. However, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) and handed the banner to him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go forth and do not turn around till Allah bestows victory upon you&#8221;.</span> (On hearing this) `Ali proceeded a little and then halted and without turning around inquired in a loud voice: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, for what shall I fight them?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go on fighting till they affirm that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they admit that, their lives and their properties will be secured, subject to their obligations according to Islam, and they will be answerable to Allah&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 9<br>
Pondering over the Great Creation of Allah, The passing away of Life of the<br>
World, the Horrors of the Day of Requital and Laxity of One&#8217;s Nafs</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;I exhort you to one (thing) only: that you stand up for Allah&#8217;s sake in pairs and singly, &#8211; and reflect (within yourselves the life history of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))&#8221;.</b></span><b> (34:46)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): &#8216;Our Rubb! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:190,191)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not look at the camels, how they are created? And at the heaven, how it is raised? And at the mountains, how they are rooted (and fixed firm)? And at the earth, how it is spread out? So remind them (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), you are only a one who reminds&#8221;.</b></span><b> (88:17-21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen..&#8221;.</b></span><b> (47:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayat of the Qur&#8217;an and Ahadith on the subject are many. See for example Hadith No. 66 mentioned before.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So stand (ask Allah to make) you (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) firm and straight (on the religion of Islamic Monotheism) as you are commanded&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (11:112)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who say: `Our Rubb is Allah (Alone),&#8217; and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): &#8216;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Jannah which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (41:30-32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who say: `Our Rubb is (only) Allah,&#8217; and thereafter stand firm and straight (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism), on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Such shall be the dwellers of Jannah, abiding therein (forever), &#8211; a reward for what they used to do.&#8221;</b></span><b> (46:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>85.</b> Sufyan bin `Abdullah  (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, tell me something of Islam which I will not ask anyone else about it.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Say, `I believe in Allah&#8217; and then be steadfast&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>86.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Follow the Right Path of Faith strictly, and be steadfast; and keep in mind that none of you can achieve salvation through his (good) actions.&#8221;</span> Someone asked, &#8220;Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Not even me, unless Allah grants me His Mercy and Grace&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 7<br>
Firm Belief and Perfect Reliance on Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And when the believers saw Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), they said: &#8216;This is what Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger   (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) had spoken the truth, and it only added to their Faith and to their submissiveness (to Allah)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:22)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Those (i.e., believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said, `Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.&#8217; But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: `Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)&#8217;. So they returned with grace and bounty from Allah. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:173,174)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And put your trust (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the Ever Living One Who dies not.&#8221;</b></span><b> (25:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And in Allah (Alone) let the believers, put their trust.&#8221;</b></span><b> (14:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:159)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him&#8221;.</b></span><b> (65:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts; and when His Verses (this Qur&#8217;an) are recited unto them, they (i.e., the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Rubb (Alone).&#8221;</b></span><b> (8:2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>74.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I was shown the past nations. I saw a Prophet who had a very small group (less than ten in total) with him, another Prophet who was accompanied by only one or two men and some did not have even one. Suddenly I was shown a huge crowd and I thought that they were my Ummah, but I was told: &#8216;This is Musa (Moses) and his people, but look towards the other side.&#8217; I looked and beheld a great assemblage. I was told: &#8216;These are your people and amongst them there are seventy thousand who shall enter Jannah without being taken to account or torment&#8221;. Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up and went into his apartment, and the Companions began to guess who may be those people who would enter Jannah without any accounting or torment. Some said: &#8220;Probably, they are the ones who kept company with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8221;. Others said: &#8220;Probably, they are the ones who have been born as Muslims and have never associated anyone with Allah in worship&#8221;. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came out and asked, &#8220;What are you discussing?&#8221; So they told him. He then said, &#8220;They are those who do not make Ruqyah (blowing over themselves after reciting the Qur&#8217;an or some prayers and supplications the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say) nor seek it, nor perceive omens (i.e., they are not pessimistic) but keep trust in their Rubb (Allah).&#8221; On this &#8216;Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and asked: &#8220;Pray to Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;You are one of them.&#8221; Then another man stood up and asked the same thing. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) answered, &#8220;&#8216;Ukashah has surpassed you&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Mulsim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>75.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! To You I have submitted, and in You do I believe, and in You I put my trust, to You do I turn, and for You I argued. O Allah, I seek refuge with You through Your Power; there is none worthy of worship except You Alone; that You safeguard me against going astray. You are the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists; the One Who never dies, whereas human beings and jinn will all die&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>76.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> When (Prophet) Ibrahim (Abraham) was thrown into the fire, he said: &#8220;Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and, He is the Best Disposer of affairs.&#8221; So did Messenger of Allah Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he was told: &#8220;A great army of the pagans had gathered against him, so fear them&#8221;. But this (warning) only increased him and the Muslims in Faith and they said: &#8220;Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>77.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A group of people (both men and women) whose hearts will be like the hearts of birds, will enter Jannah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  It has been interpreted that such people are those who put their trust in Allah; another interpretation is that these people are tender-hearted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>78.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I went in an expedition along with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the direction of  Najd. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned, I also returned with him. Then the mid-day sleep overtook us in a valley full of prickly shrubs. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got down and the people scattered around seeking shade under the trees. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) hang up his sword on the branch of a tree. We were enjoying a sleep when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called us, and lo! There was a desert Arab bedouin near him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This man brandished my sword over me while I was asleep. I woke up and saw it in his hand unsheathed. He asked: `Who will protect you from me?&#8217; I replied: &#8216;Allah&#8217; &#8211; thrice&#8221;</span>. He did not punish him and sat down.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In another narration, Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the campaign of Dhat-ur-Riqa`. We left Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to take rest under a shady tree. One of the polytheists came to him. The sword of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was hanging on a tree. He drew it and said: &#8220;Are you afraid of me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> Then he said: &#8220;Who will then protect you from me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> And in a narration of Abu Bakr Al-Isma`ili<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> the polytheist asked: &#8220;Who will protect you from me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah.&#8221;</span> As soon as he said this, the sword fell down from his hand and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) catching the sword, asked him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will protect you from me.</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Please forgive me.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On condition you testify that there is none worthy of worship but Allah and that I am His Messenger.</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I promise you that I shall not fight against you, nor shall I be with those who fight with you&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) let him go. He then went back to his companions and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I have come to you from one of the best of mankind</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>79.</b> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you all depend on Allah with due reliance, He would certainly give you provision as He gives it to birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with full belly at dusk&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>80.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked me to recite whenever I go to bed: &#8220;Allahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa wajjahtu wajhi ilaika, wa fawwadtu amri ilaika, wal-ja&#8217;tu zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, la malja wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Amantu bikitabikal-ladhi anzalta, wa nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta (O Allah! I have submitted myself to You, I have turned my face to You, entrusted my affairs to You; and committed my back to You out of desire for You and fear of You; expecting Your reward and fearing Your punishment). There is no refuge and no place of safety from You but with You. I believe in the Book You have revealed and in the Prophet You have sent.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said that if anyone recited these words and died that night, he would die in the true religion. In case he remains alive till morning, he will obtain good<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In another narration: He reported Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you go to bed, perform the Salat Wudu&#8217;, lie down on your right side and say [the above Du`a (supplication)] and let these words be your last&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>81.</b> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) said: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I were in the cave of Thaur and I saw the feet of the polytheists who were above us at the mouth of the cave (on the eve of the Emigration), I submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If one of them were to look down below his feet, he would see us&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two whose third is Allah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>82.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  stepped out of his house, he would say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Bismillah, tawakkaltu `alallah. Allahumma inni a`udhu bika an adilla aw udalla, aw azilla aw uzalla, aw azlima aw uzlama, aw ajhala aw yujhala `alayya&#8221;. &#8220;[I go forth. (I begin with the Name of Allah, I trust in Allah; O Allah! I seek refuge in You from leaving or being led astray, or against slipping or being caused to slip; or doing injustice or being done injustice; or doing wrong or having wrong done to me)]&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi reported it. According to At-Tirmidhi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> this Hadith is classified as Hasan Sahih. Its wording is from Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>83.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever says (upon leaving his house): `Bismillah, tawakkaltu `alallah, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah [I begin with the Name of Allah; I trust in Allah; there is no altering of conditions but by the Power of Allah],&#8217; it will be said to him: &#8216;You are guided, defended and protected.&#8217; The devil will go far away from him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Abu Dawud reported it with this addition: &#8220;One devil will say to another: &#8216;How can you deal with a man who has been guided, defended and protected?&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>84.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There were two brothers in the days of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). One of them used to attend the Prophet&#8217;s circle (to acquire knowledge) and the other used to earn their living). Once the latter complained to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against the former (for not earning his living). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Perhaps you are being provided because of him&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 5<br>
Watchfulness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Who sees you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) when you stand up (alone at night for Tahajjud prayers). And your movements among those who fall prostrate (to Allah in the five compulsory congregational prayers)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (26:218,219)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be&#8221;.</b></span><b> (57:4)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, your Rubb is Ever Watchful (over them)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (89:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal&#8221;.</b></span><b> (40:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>60.</b> &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Once we were sitting in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when there appeared a man dressed in very white clothes and having extraordinary black hair. No signs of fatigue of journey appeared on him and he was known to none of us. He sat down facing the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) leaning his knees against the knees of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and placing both of his palms over his two thighs and said, &#8220;O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)! Tell me about Islam&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Islam is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allah; that you observe Salat (prayers), pay Zakat, observe Saum (fasting) of Ramadan and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) of the House, provided you have resources of making journey to it.&#8221;</span> He replied: &#8220;You have spoken the truth&#8221;. We were surprised to see that he had asked him and confirmed the correctness of the answers. He then enquired: &#8220;Tell me about Iman&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is to believe in Allah, and His Books, and His Messengers and the Last Day and that you believe in foreordainment, its bad and good consequences.&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;You have spoken the truth.&#8221; He then enquired: &#8220;Tell me about Ihsan.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him; and although you do not see Him, He sees  you&#8221;</span>. He enquired: &#8220;Inform me about the Hour (i.e., the Day of Resurrection)&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I have no more knowledge thereof than you&#8221;</span>. He said, &#8220;Inform me about some of its signs&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They are &#8211; that a bondswoman gives birth to her own master, and that you will find the barefooted, naked, poor shepherds competing one another in the construction of higher buildings&#8221;.</span> Then he departed. The Messenger of Allah kept silent for a while then he said to me, &#8220;O `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was Jibril (Gabriel); he came to you to teach you your religion&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>61.</b> Abu Dharr and Mu`adh bin Jabal (May Allah be pleased with them) reported that: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fear Allah wherever you are, do good deeds after doing bad ones, the former will wipe out the latter, and behave decently towards people&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>62</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: One day, I was riding behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O boy! I will instruct you in some matters. Be watchful of Allah (Commandments of Allah), He will preserve you. Safeguard His Rights, He will be ever with you. If you beg, beg of Him Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help. And remember that if all the people gather to benefit you, they will not be able to benefit you except that which Allah had foreordained (for you); and if all of them gather to do harm to you, they will not be able to afflict you with anything other than that which Allah had pre-destined against you. The pens had been lifted  and the ink had dried up&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Safeguard the Commandments of Allah, you will find Him before you. Remember Him in prosperity and He will remember you in adversity. Be sure that which you miss, was not to hit you; and what hits you, was never to miss you. Remember that the Help of Allah is obtained with patience, and relief emerges after distress, prosperity follows adversity, and hardship is followed by ease&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>63.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> You indulge in (bad) actions which are more insignificant to you than a hair while we considered them at the time of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to be great destroying sins</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>64.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Verily, &#8216;Allah, the Exalted, becomes angry, and His Anger is provoked when a person does what Allah has declared unlawful&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>65.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said that: He heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There were three men among the Banu Israel, one leper, one bald and one blind. Allah wanted to test them. He therefore, sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best. He replied: &#8220;A good colour, a good skin and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people&#8221;. He (the angel) rubbed him and his loathsomeness vanished and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked him what type of property he would like best. The leper replied that he would like camels &#8211; [or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq (one of the subnarrator of the Hadith) was uncertain, either said: &#8216;Camels,&#8217; or: &#8216;Cattle&#8217;]. He was given a pregnant she-camel. The angel invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessing on it. The angel then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied: &#8220;Good hair and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people&#8221;. The angel ran his hand over him and he was given good hair. He then asked him what property he would like best. He replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow. The angel invoked Allah&#8217;s Blessing on it. The angel then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied: &#8220;I wish that Allah restore my sight to me so that I may see people.&#8221; Thereupon the angel ran his hand over him and Allah restored his sight. The angel then asked what property he would like best. He replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. Flocks and herds were produced for the three men, the first having a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the third one full of sheep. Then the angel came in the form of a leper, to the one who had been a leper, and said: &#8220;I am a poor man and my resources have been exhausted in my journey, and my only means of reaching my destination are dependent on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property, for a camel by which I may get to my destination&#8221;. He replied: &#8220;I have many dues to pay.&#8221; The angel then said: &#8220;I think I recognize you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom Allah gave property?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I inherited this property through generations&#8221;. The angel said: &#8220;If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition&#8221;. The angel went in the form of a bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said to the former and received a similar reply. So he said: &#8220;If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition&#8221;. The angel then went to the one who had been blind and said: &#8220;I am a poor traveller and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. My only means of reaching my destination are dependant on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey&#8221;. He replied: &#8220;Yes, I was blind. Allah restored my eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by Allah that I shall not argue with you today to return anything you take, as I give it for Allah&#8217;s sake&#8221;. The angel said: &#8220;Keep your property. You have all simply been put to a test, and Allah is pleased with you and displeased with both of your companions&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 4<br>
Truthfulness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (9:119)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds)..&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:35)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them&#8221;.</b></span><b> (47:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>54.</b> Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Truth leads to piety and piety leads to Jannah. A man persists in speaking the truth till he is enrolled with Allah as a truthful. Falsehood leads to vice and vice leads to the Fire (Hell), and a person persists on telling lies until he is enrolled as a liar&#8221;.&#8217;</span><br>
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>55.</b> Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I remember (these words) from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give up what is doubtful to you for that which is not doubtful; for truth is peace of mind and falsehood is doubt&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>56.</b> Abu Sufyan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported, in course of his detailed narration about Heraclius when the latter questioned him about the teachings of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) He said that: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told (us):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah Alone and do not associate a thing with Him; and give up all that your ancestors said. &#8220;</span>He also commands us to perform Salat (prayers), to speak the truth, to observe modesty and to strengthen the ties of kinship<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>57.</b>  Abu Thabit from Sahl bin Hunaif (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will raise him to the high status of the martyrs, even if he dies on his bed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>58.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>59.</b> Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Both parties in a business transaction have a right to annul it so long as they have not separated; and if they tell the truth and make everything clear to each other (i.e., the seller and the buyer speak the truth, the seller with regard to what is purchased, and the buyer with regard to the money) they will be blessed in their transaction, but if they conceal anything and lie, the blessing on their transaction will be eliminated.&#8221;</span><br>

Chapter 2<br>
Repentance</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars said: It is necessary to repent from every sin. If the offense involves the Right of Allah, not a human, then there are three condition to be met in order that repentance be accepted by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- To desist from committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- To feel sorry for committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- To decide not to recommit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any repentance failing to meet any of these three conditions, would not be sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the sin involves a human&#8217;s right, it requires a fourth condition, i.e., to absolve onself from such right. If it is a property, he should return  it to its rightful owner. If it is slandering or backbiting, one should ask the pardon of the offended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also repent from all sins. If he repents from some, his repentance would still be sound according to the people of sound knowledge. He should, however, repent from the rest. Scriptural proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars support the incumbency of repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the, Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And all of you beg Allah to forgive you, O believers, that you may be successful&#8221;.</b></span><b> (24:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Rubb, and turn to Him in repentance&#8221;.</b></span><b> (11:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!&#8221;.</b></span><b> (66:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>13.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Allah, I seek Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him more than seventy times a day.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>14.</b> Al-Agharr bin Yasar Al-Muzani (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Turn you people in repentance to Allah and beg pardon of  Him. I turn to Him in repentance a hundred times a day&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>15</b> Anas bin Malik Al-Ansari (MayAllah be pleased with him) the servant of the Messenger of Allah narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah is more delighted with the repentance of His slave than a person who lost his camel in a desert land and then finds it (unexpectedly)&#8221;</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version of Muslim, he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a person who has his camel in a waterless desert carrying his provision of food and drink and it is lost. He, having lost all hopes (to get that back), lies down in shade and is disappointed about his camel; when all of a sudden he finds that camel standing before him. He takes hold of its reins and then out of boundless joy blurts out: &#8216;O Allah, You are my slave and I am Your Rubb&#8217;.He commits this mistake out of extreme joy&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>16.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, will continue to stretch out His Hand in the night so that the sinners of the day may repent, and continue to stretch His Hand in the daytime so that the sinners of the night may repent, until the sun rises from the west&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>17.</b>  Abu Hurairah  (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who repents before the sun rises from the west, Allah will forgive him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>18.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab  (May Allah be pleased with them) reported that: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah accepts a slave&#8217;s repentance as long as the latter is not on his death bed (that is, before the soul of the dying person reaches the throat)&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>19.</b> Zirr bin Hubaish reported: I went to Safwan bin `Assal  (May Allah be pleased with him) to inquire about wiping with wet hands over light boots while performing Wudu&#8217;. He asked me, &#8220;What brings you here, Zirr?&#8221; I answered: &#8220;Search for knowledge&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Angels spread their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of  joy for what he seeks&#8221;. I told him, &#8220;I have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands over light boots in the course of performing Wudu&#8217; after defecation or urinating. Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concerning it?&#8221;. He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands over light boots will suffice.&#8221; I, then, questioned him, &#8220;Did you hear him say anything about love and affection?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey when a bedouin called out in a loud voice, `O Muhammad.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied him in the same tone,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Here I am.</span>&#8216; I said to him (the bedouin), `Woe to you, lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.&#8217; He said, `By Allah! I will not lower my voice,&#8217; and then addressing the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he said, `What about a person who loves people but has not found himself in their company.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those whom he loves.</span>&#8216; The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: &#8220;This gateway is in the direction of Syria. Allah created it on the day He created the heavens and the earth. It is open for repentance and will not be shut until the sun rises from that direction (i.e., the West) (on Doomsday)&#8221;.<br>
[At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>20</b>. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Prophet of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There was a man from among a nation before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an inquiry about the most learned person on the earth. He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, `Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.&#8217; So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, &#8216;This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,&#8217; and the angels of punishment argued, &#8216;He never did a virtuous deed in his life.&#8217; Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, `Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.&#8217; They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was found to be nearer to the locality of the pious by a cubit and was thus included among them&#8221;.</span> Another version says:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah commanded (the land which he wanted to leave) to move away and commanded the other land (his destination) to draw nearer and then He said: &#8220;Now measure the distance between them.&#8217; It was found that he was nearer to his goal by a hand&#8217;s span and was thus forgiven&#8221;.</span> It is also narrated that he drew closer by a slight movement on his chest<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>21.</b> Abdullah bin Ka`b, who served as the guide of Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: I heard Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his remaining behind instead of  joining Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he left for the battle of Tabuk. Ka`b said: &#8220;I accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on the night of `Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) decided to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) at that time were in large number but no proper record of them was maintained<span style="color:#800000;">.</span>&#8221; Ka`b (further) said: &#8220;Few were the persons who chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves (and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims made preparations. I also would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but would come back having done nothing and said to myself: &#8216;I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like&#8217;. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out along with the Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made no mention of me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in Tabuk, he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What happened to Ka`b bin Malik?&#8217;</span> A person from Banu Salimah said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an appreciation of  his finery have detained him.&#8217; Upon this Mu`adh bin Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;By Allah, we know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), however, kept quiet. At that time he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) saw a person dressed in white and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Be Abu Khaithamah.</span>&#8216; And was Abu Khaithamah Al-Ansari was the person who had contributed a Sa` of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.&#8221; Ka`b bin Malik further said: &#8220;When the news reached me that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) arrived in Al-Madinah. It was his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and perform two Rak`ah (of optional prayer) and would then sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He then said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Come forward&#8217;.</span> I went forward and I sat in front of him. He said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride?&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you, Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.&#8217; Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;This man spoke the truth, so get up (and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.&#8217;</span> I left and some people of  Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, `By Allah, we do not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) like those who stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would have sought forgiveness for you.&#8217; By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going back to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and retract my confession. Then I said to them, &#8216;Has anyone else met the same fate?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes, two persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did and the same verdict was delivered in their case.&#8217; I asked, `Who are they?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Murarah bin Ar-Rabi` Al-`Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah Al-Waqifi.&#8217; They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited the Muslims to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent (most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings. Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, `O Abu Qatadah, I adjure you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8217; I asked him the same question again but he remained silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, `Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) know better.&#8217; My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back climbing down the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people to direct him to Ka`b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: `It has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) was treating you harshly. Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you graciously.&#8217; As I read that letter I said: &#8216;This is too a trial,&#8217; so I put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the Messenger of Allah and said, `Verily, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded you to keep away from your wife.&#8217; I said, `Should I divorce her or what else should I do?&#8217; He said, `No, but only keep away from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.&#8217; The same message was sent to my companions. So, I said to my wife: &#8216;You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.&#8217; The wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, but don&#8217;t let him have any sexual contact with you.</span>&#8216; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.&#8217; Members of my family said to me, `You should have sought permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in regard to your wife. He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for I do not know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a young man&#8217;. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very state which Allah described as: `The earth seemed constrained for me despite its vastness&#8217;, I heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal` shouting at the top of his voice: &#8216;O Ka`b bin Malik, rejoice.&#8217; I fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: &#8216;Congratulations for acceptance of your repentance.&#8217; I reached the mosque where Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin `Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.&#8221; Ka`b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka`b further said: &#8220;I greeted Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with `As-salamu `alaikum&#8217; and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth.</span> &#8216;I said: `O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, it is from Allah.</span>&#8216; And it was common with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)!&#8217; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Keep some property with you, as it is better for you.&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;I shall keep with me that portion which is in Khaibar&#8217;. I added: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as I am alive.&#8221; Ka`b added: &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone among the Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said this to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of this to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have never intended to tell a lie, and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these Verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8216;Allah has forgiven the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the Muhajirun (Muslim Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join [the Tabuk expedition and whose case was deferred (by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) for Allah&#8217;s Decision] till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto Him)]. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds).&#8221;</span> (9:117,118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b said: &#8220;By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"> They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijsun [i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place &#8211; a recompense for that which they used to earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Al-Fa&#8217;siqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)&#8221;.</span> (9:95,96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b further added: &#8220;The matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept our matter pending till Allah decided it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> The three whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy.</span> The reference here is not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which he accepted&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another version adds: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out for Tabuk on Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.&#8221; Another version says: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he would perform two Rak`ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself there&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>22.</b>  Imran bin Al-Husain Al-Khuza`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman from the tribe Juhainah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while she was pregnant from (Zina) adultery and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have committed an offense liable to Hadd (prescribed punishment), so exact the execution of the sentence.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called her guardian and said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Treat her kindly. Bring her to me after the delivery of the child.&#8221;</span> That man complied with the orders. At last the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded to carry out the sentence. Her clothes were secured around her and she was stoned to death. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led her funeral prayers. `Umar submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! She committed Zina and you have performed funeral prayer for her?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, she made repentance which would suffice for seventy of the people of Al-Madinah if it is divided among them. Can there be any higher degree of  repentance than that she sacrificed her life voluntarily to win the Pleasure of Allah, the Exalted?&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>23.</b> Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a son of Adam were to own a valley full of gold, he would desire to have two. Nothing can fill his mouth except the earth (of the grave). Allah turns with mercy to him who turns to Him in repentance&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>24.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, smiles at two men, one of them killed the other and both will enter Jannah. The first is killed by the other while he is fighting in the Cause of Allah, and thereafter Allah will turn in mercy to the second and guide him to accept Islam and then he dies as a Shaheed (martyr) fighting in the Cause of Allah.&#8221;</span><br>

Chapter 1<br>
Sincerity and Significance of Intentions and all Actions, Apparent and Hidden</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and that is the right religion.&#8221;</b></span><b> (98:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ): Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it</b></span><b>&#8220;. (3:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1</b>. Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him), reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The deeds are considered by the intentions, and a person will get the reward according to his intention. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration would be for what he emigrated for</span>&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2</b>. Narrated &#8216;A`ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;An army will raid the Ka`bah and when it reaches a desert land, all of them will be swallowed up by the earth.&#8221;</span> She asked<span style="color:#0000ff;">;</span> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Why all of them?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">All of them will be swallowed by the earth but they will be raised for Judgement according to their intentions.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> A`ishah  (May Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is no emigration after the conquest (of Makkah) but only Jihad [(striving and fighting in the cause of Allah) will continue] and good intention.* So if you are summoned to fight, go forth.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*. Intention according to An-Nawawi: It means that goodness which ceased to continue by the cessation of emigration can still be obtained by Jihad and by intending accomplishing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.  </b>Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleasedwith them) reported: We accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in an expedition when he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are some men in Al-Madinah who are with you wherever you march and whichever valley you cross. They have not joined you in person because of their illness.&#8221;</span> In another version he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They share the reward with you.&#8221;</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari from Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him): We were coming back from the battle of Tabuk with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are people whom we left behind in Al-Madinah who accompanied us in spirit in every pass and valley we crossed. They remained behind for a valid excuse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5.</b>  Ma`n bin Yazid bin Akhnas (May Allah be pleased with them) (he, his father and his grandfather, all were Companions) reported: My father set aside some dinars for charity and gave them to a man in the mosque. I went to that man and took back those dinars. He said: &#8220;I had not intended you to be given.&#8221; So we went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and put forth the matter before him. He said to my father,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yazid, you have been rewarded for what you intended.&#8221;</span> And he said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ma`n, you are entitled to what you have taken.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6.</b> Abu Ishaq Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) (one of the ten who had been given the glad tidings of entry into Jannah) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited me in my illness which became severe in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you can see the pain which I am suffering and I am a man of means and there is none to inherit from me except one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> I asked him, &#8220;Then half?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> Then I asked, &#8220;Can I give away one-third&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give away one-third, and that is still too much. It is better to leave your heirs well-off than to leave them poor, begging people. You will not expend a thing in charity for the sake of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it; even the morsel of food which you feed your wife&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, would I survive my companions?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you survive others and accomplish a thing for the sake of Allah, you would gain higher ranking and standing. You will survive them &#8230; your survival will be beneficial to people (the Muslim) and harmful to others (the enemies of Islam). You will survive others till the people will derive benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, complete for my Companions their emigration and do not cause them to retract.&#8221;</span> Sa`d bin Khaulah was unfortunate<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) lamented his death as he died in Makkah.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah does not look at your figures, nor at your attire but He looks at your hearts and accomplishments&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that Messenger of Allah  (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked about who fights in the  battlefield out of valour, or out of  zeal, or out of  hypocrisy, which of this is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah? He said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who fights in order that the Word of Allah remains the supreme, is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>9.</b> Abu Bakrah Ath-Thaqafi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When two Muslims are engaged in a combat against each other with their sword&#8217;s and one is killed, both are doomed to Hell&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! As to the one who kills, it is understandable, but why the slain one?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was eager to kill his opponent&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>10.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The reward for Salat performed by a person in congregation is more than 20 times greater than that of the Salat performed in one&#8217;s house or shop. When one performs Wudu&#8217; perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of performing Salat, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is eliminated until he enters the mosque, and when he enters the mosque, he is considered as performing Salat as long as it is the Salat which prevents him (from leaving the mosque); and the angels keep on supplicating Allah for him as long as he remains in his place of prayer. They say: &#8216;O Allah! have mercy on him; O Allah! forgive his sins; O Allah! accept his repentance&#8217;. This will carry on as long as he does not pass wind</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>11.</b> `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:  Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said that Allah, the Glorious, said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah (SWT) has ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down. Then He explained it clearly how (to write): He who intends to do a good deed but he does not do it, then Allah records it for him as a full good deed, but if  he carries out his intention, then Allah the Exalted, writes it down for him as from ten to seven hundred folds, and even more. But if he intends to do an evil act and has not done it, then Allah writes it down with Him as a full good deed, but if he intends it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>12.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated that: He heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three men, amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: `Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.&#8217; Thereupon, one of them said: `O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If  I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock&#8217;. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape. The next said: `O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.&#8217; The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out. The third one said: `O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If  I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.&#8217; The rock slipped aside and they got out walking freely&#8221;.</span><br>

She said: The wording of Allah&#8221; what is recited to you&#8221; in the Book means the first verse, i. e.&#8221; if you fear that you may not be able to observe equity in case of an orphan woman, marry what you like in case of woman&#8221; (iv. 3). &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: (And as for this verse [iv. 126], i. e. and you intend&#8221; to marry one of them from amongst the orphan girls&#8221; it pertains to one who is in charge (of orphans) having small amount of wealth and less beauty and they have been forbidden that they should marry what they like of her wealth and beauty out of the orphan girls, but with equity, because of their disliking for them.</p>

Thereupon the polytheists said: Islam is of no avail to us for we have made peer with Allah and we killed the soul which Allah had forbidden to do and we committed debauchery, and it was (on this occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Except him who repents and believes and does good deeds&#8221; up to the end Ibn &#8216;Abbis says: He who enters the fold of Islam and understands its command and then kills the soul there is no repentance for him.</p>

Malik that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: (The sinners) would be thrown therein and it would continue to say: Is there anything more, until Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would keep His foot there- in and some of its part would draw close to the other and it would say: Enough, enough, by Thy Honour and by Thy Dignity, and there would be enough space in Paradise until Allah would create a new creation and He would make them accommo- date that spare place in Paradise.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Iyad b. Him-ar reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), while delivering a sermon one day, said: Behold, my Lord commanded me that I should teach you which you do not know and which He has taught me today. (He has instructed thus): The property which I have conferred upon them is lawful for them. I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the worship of Allah but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Re, although he has no justification for that. And verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, but with the exception of some remnants from the People of the Book. And He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you to test and put (those to test) through you. And I sent the Book to you which cannot be washed away by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep. Verily, Allah commanded me to burn (kill) the Quraish. I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of bread, and Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We shall help you in this, you should spend and you would be conferred upon. You send an army and I would send an army five times greater than that. Fight against those who disobey you along with those who obey you. The inmates of Paradise are three: One who wields authority and is just and fair, one who Is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds. And the person who is merciful and kind hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and one who does not stretch his hand in spite of having a large family to support. And He said: The inmates of Hell are five: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth. And those dishonest whose greed cannot be concealed even in the case of minor things. And the third. who betray you. morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property. He also made a mention of the miser and the liar and those who are in the habit of abusing people and using obscene and foul language. Abu Ghassan in his narration did not make mention of&#8221; Spend and there would be spent for you.&#8221;</p>

He found four, five or six graves there. He said: Who amongst you knows about those lying in the graves? A person said: It is I. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: In what state did they die? He said: They died as polytheists. He said: These people are passing through the ordeal in the graves. If it were not the reason that you would stop burying (your dead) in the graves on listening to the torment in the grave which I am listening to, I would have certainly made you hear that.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:&#8221; When the hypocrites come&#8221; (lxiii. 1). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar reported that when &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul died. His son &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abdullah (b. Ubayy) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that &#8216;Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:&#8221; You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times&#8221; (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud reported that there gathered near the House three persons amongst whom two were Quraishi and one was a Thaqafi or two were Thaqafis and one was a Quraishi. They lacked understanding but wore more flesh. One of them said: Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you&#8221; (xli. 22).</p>

The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) were divided in two groups. One group said: We would kill them, and the other one said: No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?&#8221; (iv. 88).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri reported that during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the hypocrites behaved in this way that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) set out for a battle, they kept themselves behind, and they became happy that they had managed to sit in the house contrary to (the act of) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace he upon him) came back, they put forward excuses and took oath and wished that people should laud them for the deeds which they had not done. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement&#8221; (iii. 18).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Humaid b. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf reported that Marwan said to Rafi&#8217;, his chamberlain, that he should go to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and ask him: If every one of us be punished for his being happy upon his deed and for his being praised for what he has not done, nobody would be saved from the torment. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book.&#8221; Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this&#8221; (iii. 186), and then Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done&#8221; (iii. 186). Ibn &#8216;Abbas (further) said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed.</p>

Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? &#8216;Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not remember what Shu&#8217;ba said about them.</p>

He said: It was not because of any covenant that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from us which he did get from other people, and he further said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; In my Ummah.&#8221; And I think that Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise and they would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle&#8217;s hole. Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tufail reported that there was a dispute between Hudhaifa and one from the people of Aqaba as it happens amongst people. He said: I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.</p>

So the first to take their horses were the people of Banu Khazraj. Then there was a ceaseless flow of persons and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: All of you are those who have been pardoned except the owner of a red camel. We came to him and said to him: You also come on, so that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) may seek forgiveness for you. But he said: By Allah, so far as I am concerned, the finding of something lost is dearer to me than seeking of forgiveness for me by your companion (the Holy Prophet), and he remained busy in finding out his lost thing.</p>

He ran away as a rebel and joined the People of the Book. They gave it much importance and said: He is the person who used to transcribe for Muhammad and they were much pleased with him. Time rolled on that Allah caused his death. They dug the grave and buried him therein, but they found to their surprise that the earth had thrown him out over the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Destiny (Kitab-ul-Qadr) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We give below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah&#8217;s Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore, stirs without His Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power (xlii. 48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy Qur&#8217;an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has done an atorn&#8217;s weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an atom&#8217;s weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur&#8217;an does not always signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Greatest Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:&#8221; Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God&#8217;s knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God&#8217;s creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one&#8217;s inherent possibilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.</p>

The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother&#8217;s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.</p>

And both these things would be written. Then the angel says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And both these things are written.

Thereupon the person said to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saving: When forty nights pass after the semen gets into the womb, Allah sends the angel and gives him the shape. Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down. Then he says: My Lord, what about his livelihood? And then the Lord decides as He likes and the angel writes it down, and then the angel gets out with his scroll of destiny in his hand and nothing is added to it and nothing is subtracted from it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu al-Aswad reported that &#8216;Imran b Husain asked him: What is your view, what the people do today in the world, and strive for, is it something decreed for them or preordained for them or will their fate in the Hereafter be deterrained by the fact that their Prophets brought them teaching which they did not act upon? I said: Of course, it is something which is predetermined for them and preordained for them. He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish them)? I felt greatly disturbed because of that, and said: Everything is created by Allah and lies in His Power. He would not be questioned as to what He does, but they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: May Allah have mercy upon you, I did not mean to ask you but for testing your intelligence. Two men of the tribe of Muzaina came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what is your opinion that the people do in the world and strive for, is something decreed for them; something preordained for them and will their fate in the Hereafter be determined by the fact that their Prophets brought them teachings which they did not act upon. and thus they became deserving of punishment? Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:&#8221; Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety&#8221; (xci. 8).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha, the mother of the believers, said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was called to lead the funeral prayer of a child of the Ansar. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is happiness for this child who is a bird from the birds of Paradise for it committed no sin nor has he reached the age when one can commit sin. He said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, per adventure, it may be otherwise, because God created for Paradise those who are fit for it while they were yet in their father&#8217;s loins and created for Hell those who are to go to Hell. He created them for Hell while they were yet in their father&#8217;s loins.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: You have asked from Allah about durations of life already set, and the length of days already allotted and the sustenances the share of which has been fixed. Allah would not do anything earlier before its due time, or He would not delay anything beyond its due time. And if you were to ask Allah to provide you refuge from the torment of the HellFire, or from the torment of the grave, it would have good in store for you and better for you also. He (the narrator) further said: Mention was made before him about monkeys, and Mis&#8217;ar (one of the narrators) said: I think that (the narrator) also (made a mention) of the swine, which had suffered metamorphosis. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily, Allah did not cause the race of those which suffered metamorphosis to grow or they were not survived by young ones. Monkeys and swine had been in existence even before (the metamorphosis of the human beings).</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her: Verily, you have asked Allah about the durations of life already set, and the steps which you would take, and the sustenances the share of which is fixed. Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented and suffered metamorphosis).

I gave the miswak to the younger one. It was said to me to give that to the older one and I gave it to the older one.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I saw in sleep that I was about to migrate from Mecca to a land abounding in palmtrees and I guessed that it would be Yamama or Hajar, but it was the city of Yathrib (the old name of Medina), and I saw in this dream of mine that I was brandishing a sword and its upper end was broken and this is what fell (in the form of misfortune to the believers on the Day of Ubud). I brandished (the sword) for the second time and it became all right and this is what came to be true when Allah granted us victory and solidarity of the believers. And I saw therein cows also and Allah is the Doer of good. These meant the group from amongst the believers on the Day of Ubud and the goodness which Allah brought after that and the reward of attestation of his Truth which Allah brought to us after the Day of Badr.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas reported that Musailima al-Kadhdhab (the greater liar) (who claimed prophethood after the death of the Holy Prophet) came during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) to Medina and said: If Muhammad assigns his caliphate to me after him I would follow, and there came along with him a large body of persons of his tribe and there came to him Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a piece of wood in his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company of his companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would never give it to you. I am not going to do anything against the will of God in your case, and if you turn away (from what I say) Allah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I was shown (in the dream) and here is Thabit and he would answer you on my behalf. He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: I asked the (meanings of the) words of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him):&#8221; You are the same what I was made to see about you in my dream.&#8221; and Abu Huraira reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger. (may peace be upon him) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my hands two gold bangles. This had a disturbing effect upon me and I was given a suggestion in the sleep that I should blow over them, so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted these (two bangles) as the two great liars who would appear after me and the one amongst them was &#8216;Anasi the inhabitant of San&#8217;a&#8217; and the other one Musailima the inhabitant of Yamama.</p>

There he found a dead lamb with very short ears. He took hold of his ear and said: Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham? They said: We do not like to have it even for less than that as it is of no use to us. He said: Do you wish to have it (free of any cost)? They said: By Allah, even if it were alive (we would not have liked to possess that), for there is detect in it as its ear is very short; now it is dead also. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah, this world is more insignificant in the eye of Allah as it (this dead lamb) is in your eye.</p>

Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakra reported on the authority of his father that a person praised another person in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: Woe be to thee, you have broken the neck of your friend, you have broken the neck of your friend-he said this twice. If one of you has to praise his friend at all, he should say: I think (him to be) so and Allah knows it well and I do not know the secret of the heart and Allah knows the destined end, and I cannot testify his purity against Allah but (he appears) to be so and so.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Woe be to thee, you have broken the neck of your friend, and he said this twice. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If anyone has to praise his brother at all, he should say: I think him to be so and so, and even on this he should say: I do not consider anyone purer than Allah (considers).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) thus said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk&#8217;s) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 042, Number 7150:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7150"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7150"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father (&#8216;Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to &#8216;Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

Safwan both went to Umm Salama, the Mother of the Faithful, and they asked her about the army which would be sunk in the earth, and this relates to the time when Ibn Zubair (was the governor of Mecca). She reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to sink. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them buf he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention. Abu Ja&#8217;far said. &#8216; This plain, ground means the plain ground of Medina.</p>

I said: It is I. Thereupon he said: You are bold (enough to make this claim). And he further said: How? I said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would (first) be turmoil for a person in regard to his family, his property, his own self, his children, his neighbours (and the sins comnaitted in their connection) would be expiated by fasting, prayer, charity, enjoining good and prohibiting evil. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: I do not mean (that turmoil on a small scale) but that one which would eme-ge like the mounting waves of the ocean. I said: Commander of the Faithful, you have nothing to do with it, for the door is closed between you and that. He said: Would that door be broken or opened? I said: No, it would be broken. Thereupon he said: Then it would not be closed despite best efforts. We said to Hudhaifa: Did Umar know the door? Thereupon he said: Yes, he knew it (for certain) just as one knows that night precede the next day. And I narrated to him something in which there was nothing fabricated. Shaqiq (one of the narrators) said: We dared not ask Hudhaifa about that door. So we requested Masrdq to ask him. So he asked him and he said: (By that door, he meant) &#8216;Umar.</p>

When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah&#8217;s eye, would be killed ani the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).</p>

I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Umar reported: &#8216;Umar b. Khattab went along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the company of some persons toIbn Sayyad that he found him playing with children near the bettlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adolescence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) struck his back with his hands. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Ibn Sayyad, don&#8217;t you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: What do you see? Ibn Sayyad said: It us a Dukh. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Therupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and he is not that ther is no good for you to kill him. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar further narrated that after some time Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may pcxce be upon him) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If she had left him alone he would have made things clear. Abdullah b. Umar told that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: &#8216;Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) informed him that the day when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.</p>

He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Dajjal would come forth and a person from amongst the believers would go towards him and the armed men of the Dajjal would meet him and they would say to him: Where do you intend to go? He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said:&#8221; On the day when the shank would be uncovered&#8221; (lxviii. 42).</p>

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.

If I were to see him do that, I would trample his neck, or I would beamear his face with dust. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he was engaged in prayer and thought of trampling his neck (and the people say) that he came near him but turned upon his heels and tried to repulse something with his hands. It was said to him: What is the matter with you? He said: There is between me and him a ditch of fire and terror and wings. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: If he were to come near me the angels would have torn him to pieces. Then Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse- (the narrator) said: We do not whether it is the hadith transmitted te Abu Huraira or something conveyed to him from another source:&#8221; Nay, man is surely inordinate, because he looks upon himself as self-sufficient. Surely to thy Lord is the return. Hast thou seen him who forbids a servant when he prays? Seest thou if he is on the right way, or enjoins observance of piety? Seest thou if he [Abu Jah]] denies and turns away? Knowest he not that Allah sees? Nay. if he desists not, We will seize him by the forelock-a lying, sinful forelock. Then let him summon his council. We will summon the guards of the Hell. Nay! Obey not thou him&#8221; (Icvi. 6-19). (Rather prostrate thyself.)

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)?

This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: For Mudar? You are overbold, but he supplicated Allah for them. It was upon this that this verse was revealed:&#8221; We shall remove the chastisement a little, but they will surely return to evil&#8221; (xliv. 15). lie (the narrator) said: There was a downpoor of rain upon them. When there was some relief for them they returned to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the similitude of a believer is that of a standing crop in a field which is shaken by wind and then it comes to its original position but it stands at its roots. The similitude of a non-believer is that of a cypress tree which stands on its roots and nothing shakes it but it is uprooted (with) one (violent stroke).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaqiq reported: We were sitting at the door of Abdullah (b. Mas&#8217;ud) waiting for him (to come out and deliver a sermon to us). It was at this time that there happened to pass by us Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiya an-Nakha&#8217;i. We said: Inform him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Mas&#8217;ud) of our presence here. He went in and Abdullah b. Mas&#8217;ud lost no time in coming out to us and said: I was informed of your presence here but nothing hindered me to come out to you but the fact that I did not like to bore you (by stuffing your minds with sermons) as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not deliver us sermon on certain days fearing that it might prove to be boring for us.</p>

A person said: Abu &#8216;Abd al-Rahman, we love your talk and so we yearn (to listen to you) and earnestly desire that you should deliver us lecture every day. Thereupon he said: There is nothing to hinder me in giving you talk (every day) but the fact that you may be bored. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not deliver sermons on certain days (fearing that we might be bored).</p>

(The Holy Prophet) further said: By Allah, Allah is more pleased wth the repentance of His servant than what one of you would do on finding the lost camel in the waterless desert. When he draws near Me by the span of his hand. I draw near him by the length of a cubit and when he draws near Me by the length of a cubit. I draw near him by the length of a fathom and when he draws near Me walking I draw close to him hurriedly.</p>

He heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His believing servant than a person who loses his riding beast carrying food and drink. He sleeps (being disappointed of its recovery) and then gets up and goes in search for that, until he is stricken with thirst. then comes back to the place where he had been before and goes to sleep completely exhausted placing his head upon his hands waiting for death. And when he gets up, lot there is before him his riding beast and his provisions of food and drink. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the recovery of this riding beast along with the provisions (of food and drink).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Nu&#8217;man b. Bashir reported: Allah is more pleased with the repentance of a believing servant than of a person who set out on a journey with a provision of food and drink on the back of his camel. He went on until he came to a waterless desert and he felt like sleeping. So he got down under the shade of a tree and was overcome by sleep and his camel ran away. As he got up he tried to see (the camel) standing upon a mound. but did not find it. He then got upon the other mound, but could not see anything. He then climbed upon the third mound but did not see anything until he came back to the place where he had been previously. And as he was sitting (in utter disappointment) there came to him the camel, till that (camel) placed its nosestring in his hand. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the person who found (his lost camel) in this very state. Simak reported that Sha&#8217;bi was of the opinion that Nu&#8217;min traced it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Simak, however, did not hear that himself.</p>

He (in response to the question of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he would feel highly delighted. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. By Allah, Allah is more delighted at the repentance of His servant than that person (as he finds his lost) camel.</p>

He takes hold of his nosestring and then out of boundless joy says: 0 Lord, Thou art my servant and I am Thine Lord. He commits this mistake out of extreme delight.</p>

He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: No. He killed him also and thus completed one hundred. He then asked about the learned persons of the earth and he was directed to a scholar, and he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: Yes; what stands between you and the repentance? You better go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good at all. Then there came another angel in the form of a human being in order to decide between them. He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of it. Qatada said that Hasan told him that it was said to them that as death approached him, he crawled upon his chest (and managed) to slip in the land of mercy.</p>

Ibn Shihab (further) reported that &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b informed him that Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b who served as the guide of Ka&#8217;b b. &#8216;Malik as he became blind that he heard Ka&#8217;b b. Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik said: I never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their enemies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the night of &#8216;Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and (my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had never before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land (which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. And the Muslims who accompanied Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at that time were large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka&#8217;b (further) said: Few were the persons who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (descended in connection with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition when the fruits were ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made preparations and the Muslims too along with them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out and the Muslims too along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their incapacity and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took no notice of me until he had reached Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik? A person from Banu&#8217; Salama said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his appreciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua&#8217;dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon that what you contend. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa&#8217; of dates and was scoffed at by the hypocrites. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fabricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my family and when it was said to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to arrive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak&#8217;ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Allah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put forward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expedition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This man told the truth, so get up until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu&#8217; Salama followed me in hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have sought forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi&#8217;a &#8216;Amiri and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they named these two persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the Nluslims to talk with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he sat amongst (people) after the prayer, greeted him and asked myself whether his lips stirred in response to my greetings (or not).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by Allah. arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik. People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:&#8221; Coming to my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to me and said: Verily, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a senile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don&#8217;t go near him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), for I cannot say what Allah&#8217;s Apostle may say in response to seeking my permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fiftieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in these words:&#8221; Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness,&#8221; that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal&#8217; saying at the top of his voice: Ka&#8217;b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there was (a message of) relief for me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed the people of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on my way I met groups of people who greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka&#8217;b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talha. Ka&#8217;b further said: I greeted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad tidings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it looked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah&#8217;s sake and for the sake of His Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part (of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that repentance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Allah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed these verses:&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their souls were also straitened to them.&#8221; And this revelation reached up to the (words):&#8221; O you who believe, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful&#8221; (ix. 117-118). Ka&#8217;b said: By Allah, since Allah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used harshest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):&#8221; They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people&#8221; (ix. 95-96). K&#8217;ab said that the matter of us three persons was deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221; the three who were left behind&#8221; do not mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. Musayyib, &#8216;Urwa b. Zubair, &#8216;Alqama b. Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. &#8216;Utba b. Mas&#8217;ud&#8211;all of them reported the story of the false allegation against &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (listening) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The sumaried substance of the false allegation is this): &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu&#8217;attal Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#8217;un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I covered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed tLe camel&#8217;s foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy, the great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell ill before this. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would coome and greet me with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. &#8216;Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. &#8216;Amir, the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. &#8216;Abbad b. Muttalib. I and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to my house and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me and he greeted me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wives also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali ibn Abi &#8216;Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about thembut goodness. And as for &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wives). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell you the truth. So, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you see anything in &#8216;A&#8217;isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with your order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh: By the everlasting existence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh and said to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. &#8216;A&#8217;isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, &#8216;A&#8217;isha, this is what has reached me about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally there has been a lapse on your part sock forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) accepting his repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I was a small girl at that time and I had not read much of the Qur&#8217;an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye describe&#8221; (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was fully aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu (Qur&#8217;anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision give an indication of my innocence to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) during his sleep. And, by Allah, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not moved an inch from where he had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, descended revelation upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) there and then and he felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire because of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me were that he said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my honour. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you&#8221; (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his poverty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: It was upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:&#8221; And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin&#8221; up to&#8221; Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?&#8221; Hibban b. Musa&#8217; said that &#8216;Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I shall not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri through other chains of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording. In the hadith transmitters on the authority of &#8216;Urwa, there is an addition of these words:&#8221; &#8216;A&#8217;isha did not like that Hassan should be rebuked in her presence and she used to say: It was he who wrote this verse also:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, my father and my mother and my honour, those are all meant for defending the honour of Muhammad against you.&#8221; And &#8216;Urwa further reported that &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: By Allah, the person, about whom the allegation was trade used to say: Hallowed be Allah, by One, in Whose hand is my life, I have never unveiled any woman, and then he die, &amp; as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and in the narration transmitted on the authority of Ya&#8217;qub b. Ibrahim., the word is Mu&#8217;irin and in the narration transmitted on the&#8217;authority of &#8216;Abd al-Razzaq it is Mughirin. &#8216;Abd b. Humaid said: I said to &#8216;Abd al-Razzaq: What does this word Mughirin mean? And he said: Al- waghra means intense heat.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;Isha reported: When I came under discussion what the people had to say about me, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up for delivering an address and he recited tashahhud (I bear witness to the fact that iheie is no god but Allah) and praised Allah, lauded Him what He rightly deserves and then said: Coming to the point. Give me an advice about them who have brought false charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind. And he was in fact a fabricator and there was Hamna, daughter of Jahsh with him.</p>

Hadrat &#8216;Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: Three persons set out on a journey. They were overtaken by rain    and they had to find protection in a mountain cave where at its mouth there fell a rock of    that mountain and thus blocked them altogether. One of them said to the others: Look to    your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then supplicate Allah, the    Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble). One of them said: 0 Allah, I had my    parents who were old and my wife and my small children also. I tended the flock and when I    came back to them in the evening, I milked them (the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first    served that milk to my parents. One day I was obliged to go out to a distant place in    search of fodder and I could not come back before evening and found them (the parents)    asleep. I milked the animals as I used to milk and brought milk to them and stood by their    heads avoiding to disturb them from sleep and I did not deem it advisable to serve milk to    my children before serving them. My children wept near my feet. I remained there in that    very state and my parents too until it was morning. And (0 Allah) if Thou art aware that I    did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. (The rock    slipped a bit) that they could see the sky. The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female    cousin whom I loved more than the men love the women. I wanted to have sexual intercourse    with her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very    great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and    when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah,    fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah,    if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from this    trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I employed    a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in    the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds,    and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my    possession). He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard    to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and    do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making a fun of you. You take the cows and the    flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case    the situation for us. And Allah relieved them from the rest of the trouble.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 35: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Remembrance  of Allah, Supplication, Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness (Kitab Al-Dhikr) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him) visited a person from amongst the Muslims in order to inquire (about his health) who    had grown feeble like the chicken. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Did you    supplicate for anything or beg of Him about that? He said: Yes. I used to utter (these    words): Impose punishment upon me earlier in this world, what Thou art going to impose    upon me in the Hereafter. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Hallowed be Allah, you have neither the power nor forbearance to take upon yourself (the    burden of His Punishment). Why did you not say this: O Allah, grant us good in the world    and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of Fire. He (the Holy Prophet)    made this supplication (for him) and he was all right.</font></p>

They say: We come from Thine servants upon the earth who had been    glorifying Thee (reciting Subhan Allah), uttering Thine Greatness (saying Allah o-Akbar)    and uttering Thine Oneness (La ilaha ill Allah) and praising Thee (uttering al-Hamdu    Lillah) and begging of Thee. Be would say: What do they beg of Me? They would say: They    beg of Thee the Paradise of Thine. He (God) would say: Have they seen My Paradise? They    said: No, our Lord. He would say: (What it would be then) if they were to see Mine    Paradise? They (the angels) said: They seek Thine protection. He (the Lord) would say:    Against what do they seek protection of Mine? They (the angels) would say: Our Lord, from    the Hell-Fire. He (the Lord) would say: Have they seen My Fire? They would say: No. He    (the Lord) would say: What it would be if they were to see My Fire? They would say: They    beg of Thee forgiveness. He would say: I grant pardon to them, and confer upon them what    they ask for and grant them protection against which they seek protection. They (the    angels) would again say: Our Lord, there is one amongst them such and such simple servant    who happened to pass by (that assembly) and sat there along with them (who had been    participating in that assembly). He (the Lord) would say: I also grant him pardon, for    they are a people the seat-fellows of whom are in no way unfortunate.</font></p>
