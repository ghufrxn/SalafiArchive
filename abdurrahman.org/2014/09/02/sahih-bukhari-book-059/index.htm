<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.285">Volume 5, Book 59, Number 285: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Ishaq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was sitting beside Zaid bin Al-Arqam, he was  asked, &#8220;How many Ghazwat did the Prophet undertake?&#8221; Zaid replied,  &#8220;Nineteen.&#8221; They said, &#8220;In how many Ghazwat did you join him?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Seventeen.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Which of these was the first?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Al-&#8216;Ashira or Al-&#8216;Ashiru.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.286"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 286: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>From Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh: Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh was an intimate friend  of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad,  and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived  at Medina, Sa&#8217;d went to perform &#8216;Umra and stayed at Umaiya&#8217;s home in Mecca. He said to  Umaiya, &#8220;Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to  perform Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met  them and said, &#8220;O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;He is Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, &#8220;I see you wandering about  safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have  changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and  support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be  able to go your family safely.&#8221; Sad, raising his voice, said to him, &#8220;By Allah,  if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent  you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through  Medina.&#8221; On this, Umaiya said to him, &#8220;O Sad do not raise your voice before  Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;O  Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle predicting that the Muslim will  kill you.&#8221; Umaiya asked, &#8220;In Mecca?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;  Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife,  &#8220;O Um Safwan! Don&#8217;t you know what Sad told me? &#8220;She said, &#8220;What has he told  you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions  that they will kill me. I asked him, &#8216;In Mecca?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I do not know.&#8221; Then  Umaiya added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.&#8221; But when the day of (the  Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, &#8220;Go and protect your  caravan.&#8221; But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said,  &#8220;O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the  people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.&#8221; Abu Jahl kept on urging  him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, &#8220;As you have forced me to change my mind, by  Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). &#8220;O Um  Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;O Abu Safwan!  Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I do  not want to go with them but for a short distance.&#8221; So when Umaiya went out, he used  to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Allah caused him to be  killed at Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I never failed to join Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any of his  Ghazawat except in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of  Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out  to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Allah caused them (i.e. Muslims) to meet their enemy  unexpectedly (with no previous intention) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 288: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would  have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e.  Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the Muslims to fight with the  pagans. Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your  Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in  front of you and behind you.&#8221; I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright with  happiness, for that saying delighted him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 289: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the battle of Badr, the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Allah! I appeal to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If Your Will is  that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans).&#8221; Then Abu Bakr took  hold of him by the hand and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for you.&#8221; The Prophet came  out saying, &#8220;Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their  backs.&#8221; (54.45) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of (the Prophet) Muhammad who took part in  Badr, told me that their number was that of Saul&#8217;s (i.e. Talut&#8217;s) companions who crossed  the river (of Jordan) with him and they were over three-hundred-and-ten men. By Allah,  none crossed the river with him but a believer. (See Qur&#8217;an 2:249) </font></p>

Then he returned and the enemy got hold of the bridle of his  (horse) and struck him two blows (with the sword) on his shoulder. Between these two  wounds there was a scar caused by a blow, he had received on the day of Badr (battle).  When I was a child I used to play with those scars by putting my fingers in them. On that  day (my brother) &#8220;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was also with him and he was ten years old.  Az-Zubair had carried him on a horse and let him to the care of some men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Badr, the Prophet ordered that the corpses of  twenty four leaders of Quraish should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr.  (It was a habit of the Prophet that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at  the battle-field for three nights. So, on the third day of the battle of Badr, he ordered  that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his companions followed him saying  among themselves.&#8221; &#8220;Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding for some  great purpose.&#8221; When he halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of  the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8220;O so-and-so, son of  so-and-so and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed  Allah and His Apostle? We have found true what our Lord promised us.

We said  (to her),&#8221;(Give us) the letter.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter.&#8221; Then we  made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we  will strip you naked.&#8221; When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below  her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter,  and we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This  Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!&#8221;  The Prophet asked Hatib, &#8220;What made you do this?&#8221; Hatib said, &#8220;By Allah, I  did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some  influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and  property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through  whom Allah protects his family and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has spoken  the truth; do no say to him but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He as betrayed Allah, His  Apostle and the faithful believers.

May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and  said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, &#8216;I have forgiven  you.&#8221;&#8216; On this, tears came out of Umar&#8217;s eyes, and he said, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know better.&#8221; </font></p>

The archers said, &#8220;These  dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&#8221; and went on tracing the Muslims&#8217; footsteps. When  &#8216;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the  enemy encircled them and said, &#8220;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise  and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit said, &#8220;O  people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O  Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&#8221; So the archers threw their arrows at them and  martyred &#8216;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise  and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers  got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with  them. The third man said, &#8220;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not  go with you for I follow the example of these.&#8221; He meant the martyred companions. The  archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid  bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca  after the event of the Badr battle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sons of Al-Harit bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for  he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin &#8216;Amr on the day (of the battle)  of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him.  One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public  hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers  went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the  razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said,  &#8220;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&#8221; Later on  (while narrating the story) she said, &#8220;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive  than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while  he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca.&#8221; She  used to say,&#8221; It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to  martyr him, Khubaib requested them. &#8220;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221;  They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been  afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.&#8221; Then he  (invoked evil upon them) saying, &#8220;O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and  do not leave anyone of them&#8221;&#8216; Then he recited: &#8220;As I am martyred as a Muslim, I  do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake, for this is for the Cause of  Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&#8221; Then Abu Sarva, &#8216;Ubqa  bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of  praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet  told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were  martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit&#8217;s death, sent some  messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for  he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a  swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of &#8216;Asim, and they shielded him from the  messengers who could not cut anything from his body. </font></p>

He died while she wa pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.&#8217; Soon after his  death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became  clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu&#8217;kak, a man from the tribe  of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, &#8220;What! I see you dressed up for the  people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Allah, you are not allowed to marry  unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband&#8217;s death).&#8221; Subai&#8217;a  in her narration said, &#8220;When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my  dress in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him about this problem. He gave  the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered  me to marry if I wished.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of  the battle of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the Khumus which  Allah had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to  Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani  Qainuqa &#8216;that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by  gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the  marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two  she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari&#8217;s dwelling and after collecting what  I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their  flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that,  I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done that?&#8221; They (i.e. the people)  said, &#8220;Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib has done it. He is present in this house with some  Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, &#8220;O  Hamza, get at the fat she-camels!&#8221; On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and cut  of the camels&#8217; humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their  livers.&#8221; Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The  Prophet noticed my state and asked, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two  she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a  house along some drinkers.&#8221; The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it on, and  proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza  was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming  Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the  Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his  face and then said, &#8220;You are not but my father&#8217;s slaves.&#8221; When the Prophet  understood that Hamza was drunk, he retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with  him. </font></p>

Some days later, Allah&#8217;s Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married  her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, &#8220;Perhaps you were angry with me when  you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr  said, &#8216;Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle , but had he (i.e. the Prophet) given her up I would surely have accepted  her.&#8221; </font></p>

On seeing the Ansar, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said,  &#8220;I think you have heard that Abu &#8216;Ubaida has brought something?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;Indeed, it is so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Be happy, and hope for  what will please you. By Allah, I am not afraid that you will be poor, but I fear that  worldly wealth will be bestowed upon you as it was bestowed upon those who lived before  you. So you will compete amongst yourselves for it, as they competed for it and it will  destroy you as it did them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That once &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was  sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Uthman,  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes, let them come in.&#8221; After a while, Yarfa-  came again and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas who are asking your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So, when the two entered, &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali). &#8220;Both of them  had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle  as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas started reproaching each  other. The (present) people (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the  believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the  earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets) our properties are  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,&#8217; and he said it  about himself?&#8221; They (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his company) said, &#8220;He did say it.  &#8220;&#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both, by  Allah! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said this?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative.  He said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His  Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give  to anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And what Allah gave to His Apostle  (&#8220;Fai&#8221;&#8221; Booty) from them&#8211;For which you made no expedition With either  Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And  Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; (59.6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  . But by Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it,  but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of  it. And from this Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and  whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s Property is spent (i.e. in  charity), Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and  Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge  of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and  all of you (at that time) knew all about it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and  &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have  described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and  the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for  the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere,  pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you  (i.e. &#8216;Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O  &#8216;Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our  property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; Then when I  thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you  will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or  else you should not speak to me (about it).&#8217; So, both of you said to me, &#8216;Hand it over to  us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now  to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the  sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision)  till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that  property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf.&#8221; The sub-narrator  said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, &#8216;Malik bin Aus has told  the truth&#8221; I heard &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, &#8216;The wives of the Prophet  sent &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted  to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don&#8217;t  you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we  leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added:  &#8216;The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the  Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.&#8217; So, this property (of Sadaqa) was  in the hands of Ali who withheld it from &#8216;Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the  hands of Hasan bin &#8216;Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin &#8216;Ali, and then in the hands of  Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn,  then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is willing to kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?&#8221; Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama got up  saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;Then allow me to say a (false) thing  (i.e. to deceive Kab). &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;You may say it.&#8221; Then Muhammad  bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &#8220;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e.  Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from  you.&#8221; On that, Kab said, &#8220;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&#8221; Muhammad  bin Maslama said, &#8220;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless  and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or  two of food.&#8221; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab  said, &#8220;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied,  &#8220;Mortgage your women to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women to  you and you are the most handsome of the &#8216;Arabs?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Then mortgage your  sons to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would  be abused by the people&#8217;s saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of  food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He  came to Kab at night along with Kab&#8217;s foster brother, Abu Na&#8217;ila. Kab invited them to come  into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &#8220;Where are you  going at this time?&#8221; Kab replied, &#8220;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster)  brother Abu Na&#8217;ila have come.&#8221; His wife said, &#8220;I hear a voice as if dropping  blood is from him, Ka&#8217;b said. &#8220;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and  my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if  invited to be killed.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators  mention the men as &#8216;Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin  Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &#8220;When Ka&#8217;b comes, I will  touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him.  I will let you smell his head.&#8221; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his  clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &#8221; have never smelt a  better scent than this. Ka&#8217;b replied. &#8220;I have got the best &#8216;Arab women who know how  to use the high class of perfume.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka&#8217;b &#8220;Will you  allow me to smell your head?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Muhammad smelt it and made  his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka&#8217;b again, &#8220;Will you let me  (smell your head)?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; When Muhammad got a strong hold of  him, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Get at him!&#8221; So they killed him and went to  the Prophet and informed him.

Abdullah (bin Atik) said to his companions,  &#8220;Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the  gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdullah proceeded towards the  castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending  to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered  &#8216;Abdullah as one of the castle&#8217;s servants) addressing him saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Servant!  Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added in his story,  &#8220;So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the  gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the  keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi for a  pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went  away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to  myself, &#8216;Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till  I have killed him.&#8217; So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his  family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; Abu  Rafi said, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the  sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out  of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, &#8216;What is this  voice, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a  sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the  sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized  that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase,  and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg  broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the  gate, and said, &#8216;I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.&#8217; So, when  (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall  saying, &#8216;I announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my  companions and said, &#8216;Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi,&#8217; So I (along  with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet and described the whole story to  him. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it  and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Atik and &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached  his castle, whereupon &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik said to them, &#8220;Wait (here), and in the  meantime I will go and see.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said later on, &#8220;I played a trick in order  to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a  flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my  head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, &#8216;Whoever  wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.&#8217; So I went in and hid myself in  a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and  had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices  vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the  gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked  the gate of the castle, saying to myself, &#8216;If these people should notice me, I will run  away easily.&#8217; Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were  inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with  its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; He  replied, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my  blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone  of my voice, &#8216; What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you not surprised? Woe  on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!&#8217; So again I aimed at him and  hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried loudly and his wife  got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying  straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the  sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase  to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to  my companions limping. I said (to them), &#8216;Go and tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle of this good news,  but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi&#8217;s) death.&#8217;  When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, &#8216;I convey to you  the news of Abu Rafi&#8217;s death.&#8217; I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I  caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good  news.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and  the Prophet placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed &#8216;Abdullah (bin  Jubair) as their commander and said, &#8220;Do not leave this place; and if you should see  us conquering the enemy, do not leave this place, and if you should see them conquering  us, do not (come to) help us,&#8221; So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heel  till I saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes from their  legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying, &#8220;The booty, the  booty!&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;The Prophet had taken a firm promise from me  not to leave this place.&#8221; But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused  (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they  suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, &#8220;Is Muhammad  present amongst the people?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abd Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab  amongst the people?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;All these people have been killed, for,  were they alive, they would have replied.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar could not help saying,  &#8220;You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.&#8221;  Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Superior may be Hubal!&#8221; On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have  (the idol) Al-&#8216;Uzza, whereas you have no &#8216;Uzza!&#8221; The Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is  always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead  men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.&#8221; Narrated  Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as  martyrs. </font></p>

Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon  us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have  been given to us in this life.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he  left the food. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We migrated in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, seeking  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Allah. Some of us have been dead  without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar  who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a  Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet  became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet  said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over  his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet.&#8221; But some amongst us have got the fruits of  their labor ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from  the battle of Badr and he said, &#8220;I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet  (i.e. Badr battle), and if Allah should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet,  Allah will see how strongly I will fight.&#8221; So he encountered the day of Uhud battle.  The Muslims fled and he said, &#8220;O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these  people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.&#8221;  Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh (fleeing), and asked him,  &#8220;Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.&#8221; Then he  proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister  recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds  caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their  Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they  have been Killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting&#8221; (33.23) So  we wrote this in its place in the Quran. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of  those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into  two groups. One group said, &#8220;We will fight them (i.e. the enemy),&#8221; and the other  group said, &#8220;We will not fight them.&#8221; So there came the Divine Revelation:&#8211; &#8216;(O  Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about  the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.&#8217;  (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which  clears one from one&#8217;s sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver.&#8221; </font></p>

My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who  are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought)  an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;You have done the right thing.&#8221; </font></p>

When the creditors saw  him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had  never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates  thrice, and then sat over it and said, &#8216;O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the  creditors).&#8217; Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till  Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of  those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved  all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet had been  sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof.&#8221; </font></p>

Hudhaifa looked, and on seeing his father  Al-Yaman, he shouted, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Worshippers, my father, my father!&#8221; But by  Allah, they did not stop till they killed him. Hudhaifa said, &#8220;May Allah forgive  you.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said, &#8220;By Allah, Hudhaifa continued asking  Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the killers of his father till he departed to Allah (i.e.  died).&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Uthman bin Mauhab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah&#8217;s) House. Seeing  some people sitting, he said, &#8220;Who are these sitting people?&#8221; Somebody said,  &#8220;They are the people of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man?&#8221; They  said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He went to him and said, &#8220;I want to ask you about  something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of  this (Sacred) House, do you know that &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan fled on the day of Uhud?&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know that he (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) was  absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance  (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Come along;  I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of &#8216;Uthman)  on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr  (battle), he was married to the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was ill, so the  Prophet said to him, &#8216;You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle  will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.&#8217; As for his absence from the  Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than  &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of &#8216;Uthman. So the  Prophet sent him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place  after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. &#8216;This is the  hand of &#8216;Uthman,&#8217; and clapped it over his other hand and said, &#8220;This is for  &#8216;Uthman.'&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then said (to the man), &#8220;Go now, after taking this  information.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jafar bin &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out with &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi Al-Khaiyar. When we  reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi said (to me), &#8220;Would you  like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to  us, &#8220;He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.&#8221; So  we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he  greeted us in return. &#8216;Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except  his eyes and feet. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;O Wahshi! Do you know me?&#8221; Wahshi looked  at him and then said, &#8220;No, by Allah! But I know that &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a  woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at  Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with  his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child&#8217;s  feet.&#8221; Then &#8216;Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), &#8220;Will you tell  us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?&#8221; Wahshi replied &#8220;Yes, Hamza killed  Tuaima bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said to  me, &#8216;If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free.&#8221; When the  people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of &#8216;Ainain ..&#8217;Ainain is a mountain  near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the  people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba&#8217; came out and said, &#8216;Is  there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?&#8217; Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib came out  and said, &#8216;O Siba&#8217;. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge  Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant  like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near  me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his  buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with  them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and  when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I was told that the  Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. When he saw me, he said, &#8216;Are you Wahshi?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was it you  who killed Hamza?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;What happened is what you have been told of.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Can  you hide your face from me?&#8217; So I went out when Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, and Musailamah  Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, &#8216;I will go out to Musailamah so  that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to  fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that  battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked  like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him,  driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders,  and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers  (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.&#8221; </font></p>

When Fatima saw that the water aggravated the  bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so  that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped).

Then he said, &#8220;I will be a witness  for them on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; He ordered them to be buried with their blood  (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed.  Jabir added, &#8220;When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face.  The companions of the Prophet stopped me from doing so but the Prophet did not stop me.

He did not leave behind except a sheet of striped woolen cloth. If we  covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his  head became naked. The Prophet said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir  (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet,&#8221; or said, &#8220;Put some Idhkhir over his  feet.&#8221; But some of us have got their fruits ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed &#8216;Asim bin  Thabit, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set  out, and when they reached (a place) between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one  of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed  their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. &#8216;Asim  and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey  food from Medina. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The archers said, &#8220;These are the dates of  Medina,&#8221; and followed their traces till they took them over. When &#8216;Asim and his  companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers  encircled them and said, &#8220;You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to  us, we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;As for me, I will never come  down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.&#8221; So they  fought with them till they killed &#8216;Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows,  and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a  covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When  they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The  third man who was with them said, &#8220;This is the first breach in the covenant,&#8221;  and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but  he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they  sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was  Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for  a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib  borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave  it to him. She said later on, &#8220;I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved  towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my  distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said &#8216;Are you afraid that I will  kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,&#8217; &#8221; Later on she used to say, &#8220;I  have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes  although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron  chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.&#8221; So they  took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, &#8220;Allow me to offer a  two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221; Then he went to them and said, &#8220;Had I not been afraid that  you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time.&#8221; So it  was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He  then said, &#8220;O Allah! Count them one by one,&#8221; and added, &#8216;When I am being  martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake,  because this death is in Allah&#8217;s Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish  (infidels) sent some people to &#8216;Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his  death might be known for certain, for &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of  Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who  could not harm his body consequently. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdul Aziz: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas said, &#8220;The Prophet sent seventy men, called  Al-Qurra &#8216;for some purpose. The two groups of Bani Sulaim called Ri&#8217;l and Dhakwan,  appeared to them near a well called Bir Ma&#8217;una. The people (i.e. Al-Qurra) said, &#8216;By  Allah, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something  for the Prophet.&#8217; But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked evil upon  them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used  not to say Qunut before that.&#8221; A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, &#8220;Is it to be  said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before  Bowing)?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;No, but (it is to be said) after finishing the  Recitation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Lihyan asked  Allah&#8217;s Apostle to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy. He  therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra&#8217; in  their lifetime. They used to collect wood by daytime and pray at night. When they were at  the well of Ma&#8217;una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the  Prophet , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of  the &#8216;Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of  the Qur&#8217;an revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled. It was:  &#8220;convey to our people on our behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He  is pleased with us, and has made us pleased.&#8221; (Anas bin Malik added:) Allah&#8217;s Prophet  said Qunut for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the &#8216;Arab  tribes (namely), Ril, Dhakwan, Usaiya, and Bani Libyan. (Anas added:) Those seventy Ansari  men were killed at the well of Mauna. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim  at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail proposed three  suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the  bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or  that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from  Bani Ghatafan.&#8221; But &#8216;Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He  said, &#8220;Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having  a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse.&#8221; So he died on the back of  his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from  so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of &#8216;Amir). Haram said (to his  companions), &#8220;Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should  give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go  back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, &#8220;Will you give me  protection so as to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So, he started talking  to them&#8217; but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him  (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of  the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e.  Haram&#8217;s companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain.  Then Allah revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: &#8216;We  have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.&#8217; (After this event)  the Prophet invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon  the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr asked the Prophet to allow him to go out (of  Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet said to him,  &#8221;Wait.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to  migrate)?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I hope so.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited for him  till one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle came at noon time and addressed him saying &#8220;Let whoever  is present with you, now leave you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;None is present but my two  daughters.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go  out (to migrate)?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would like to accompany  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You will accompany me.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our)  going out.&#8221; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet and it was Al-Jad&#8217;a  . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where  they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of &#8216;Abdullah bin Al-Tufail bin  Sakhbara &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s brother from her mother&#8217;s side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir  used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them  before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and  then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his  job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. &#8216;Amir) too went  along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns  till they reached Medina. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma&#8217;una. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma&#8217;una were  martyred and &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail, pointing at  a killed person, asked Amr, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya said to him, &#8220;He  is &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira.&#8221; &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail said, &#8220;I saw him lifted to the sky  after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought  down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he  announced the news of their death saying, &#8220;Your companions (of Bir Ma&#8217;una) have been  killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us  as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us.&#8221; So Allah informed them (i.e.  the Prophet and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that day, &#8216;Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt who was one of  them, was killed, and Urwa (bin Az-Zubair) was named after &#8216;Urwa bin Asma and Mundhir (bin  AzZubair) was named after Mundhir bin &#8216;Amr (who had also been martyred on that day). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet invoked evil upon those (people) who killed his  companions at Bir Mauna for 30 days (in the morning prayer). He invoked evil upon (tribes  of) Ril, Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. Allah revealed a Quranic  Verse to His Prophet regarding those who had been killed, i.e. the Muslims killed at Bir  Ma&#8217;una, and we recited the Verse till later it was cancelled.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas bin Malik regarding Al-Qunut during the  prayer. Anas replied, &#8220;Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet in the prayer).&#8221; I  said, &#8220;Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;(It was said)  before (Bowing).&#8221; I said, &#8220;So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was  said after Bowing.&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He was mistaken, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet had sent some people called Al-Qurra who  were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah&#8217;s Apostle violated the treaty  (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the  prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them. </font></p>

There is no  goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar  and the Emigrants.&#8221; The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to  be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having  a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who  were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq (  i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;Here is a rock appearing across the trench.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am coming  down.&#8221; Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten  anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck the big solid rock and  it became like sand. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to go home.&#8221; (When the  Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife, &#8220;I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot  treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have  barley and a she goat.&#8221; So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then  we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the dough  had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly  been well-cooked, and said, &#8220;I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the food).&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;How much is that food?&#8221; I told him about it. He said, &#8220;It is abundant and  good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out  any bread from the oven till I reach there.&#8221; Then he said (to all his companions),  &#8220;Get up.&#8221; So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to  my wife, I said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the  Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did  the Prophet ask you (how much food you had)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said, &#8220;Enter and do not throng.&#8221; The Prophet started cutting the bread  (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven  whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take  the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his  companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the  Prophet said (to my wife), &#8220;Eat and present to others as the people are struck with  hunger.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet in the state of  severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, &#8220;Have you got anything (to eat),  for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a state of severe hunger.&#8221; She brought out for me,  a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I  slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my  job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an  earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . My wife said, &#8220;Do not  disgrace me in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and those who are with him.&#8221; So I went to him  and said to him secretly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e.  kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and  another person along with you.&#8221; The Prophet raised his voice and said, &#8220;O people  of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough  till I come.&#8221; So I came (to my house) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle too, came, proceeding  before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, &#8220;May Allah do so-and-so to  you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have told the Prophet of what you said.&#8221; Then she brought  out to him (i.e. the Prophet the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah&#8217;s  Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and  invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake  along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not  put it down from its fireplace.&#8221; They were one-thousand (who took their meals), and  by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was  still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being  baked as if nothing had been taken from it. </font></p>

Muawiya addressed the people saying, &#8220;&#8216;If anybody wants to say  anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for  we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father.&#8221; On that, Habib bin  Masalama said (to Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?&#8221;  &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs  while I was sitting and was about to say, &#8216;He who fought against you and against your  father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,&#8217; but I was afraid that my  statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my  statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah  has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the  Hereafter to this worldly life).&#8221; Habib said, &#8220;You did what kept you safe and  secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a  man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-&#8216;Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban  bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai who shot an arrow at Sad&#8217;s  medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the  Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from  the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel  came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, &#8220;You  have laid down the arms?&#8221; By Allah, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to  attack them).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Where?&#8221; Gabriel pointed towards Bani  Quraiza. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They  then surrendered to the Prophet&#8217;s judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict  concerning them. Sad said, &#8220;I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed,  their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties  distributed.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;Sad said, &#8220;O Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to  fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of  Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e.  Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then  keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to  an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.&#8217; So blood gushed from the  wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the  blood flowing towards them . They said, &#8216;O people of the tent! What is this thing which is  coming to us from your side?&#8217; Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad&#8217;s wound. Sad  then died because of that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 462: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take with him the one on  whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot  fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the  women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried  down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night  that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and  went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to  my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar  beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to  look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who  used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel  on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were  light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in  abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the  lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a  young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my  necklace after the army had gone. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of  them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used  to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was  sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal  As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he  saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me  before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited  Istirja&#8217; (i.e. &#8220;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&#8217;un&#8221;) as soon as he recognized  me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single  word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&#8217;. He dismounted from his  camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode  on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in  the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the  event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk  (i.e. slander) more, was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Urwa said, &#8220;The people propagated the slander and  talked about it in his (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it  and asked about it to let it prevail.&#8221; Urwa also added, &#8220;None was mentioned as  members of the slanderous group besides (&#8216;Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah  bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but  they were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander  was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha disliked to have Hassan  abused in her presence and she used to say, &#8216;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e.  my father&#8217;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&#8217;s honor from  you.&#8221;). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;After we returned to Medina, I became  ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while  I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not  receiving the same kindness from Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick.  (But now) Allah&#8217;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&#8217; How is that (lady)?&#8217; and  leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went  out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&#8217; where we used to  answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except  at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our  concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &#8216;Arabs living in  the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and  Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was  the daughter of Sakhr bin &#8216;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was  Mistah bin Uthatha bin &#8216;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my  house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her  foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined!&#8217; I said,  &#8216;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&#8217;  On that she said, &#8216;O you Hantah! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &#8216;I said,  &#8216;What did he say?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my  ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after  greeting me, said, &#8216;How is that (lady)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8217;  as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me (and I went  to my parents) and asked my mother, &#8216;O mother! What are the people talking about?&#8217; She  said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by  her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would  find faults with her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the  people really talking in this way?&#8217; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither  stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine  Inspiration was delayed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin  Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my  innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&#8217; &#8216;Ali bin  Abi Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are  plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&#8217; On  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &#8216;O Barira! Did you  ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&#8217; Barira said to him, &#8216;By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal,  except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that  the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, on that day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and  complained about &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &#8216;O you  Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about  my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man  about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&#8217;  Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh the brother of Banu &#8216;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I  will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head  off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill  your order.&#8217; On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his  branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was  a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&#8217;adh). &#8216;By  Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your  people, you would not wish him to be killed.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin  Mu&#8217;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8216;By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill  him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.&#8217; On this, the two tribes  of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they  became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing,  and I could never sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two  nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that  my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was  weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and  when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of  the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &#8216;Amma Badu, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been  informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your  innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for  forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah  accepts his repentance.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased  flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my  father, &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; My father  said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Then I said to my mother,  &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah,  I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; In spite of the fact that I was a young  girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8216;By Allah, no doubt I know that you  heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and  you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe  me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely  believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&#8217;s father  when he said, &#8216;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is  Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my  bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my  innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine  Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be  talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might  have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to  overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body  like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which  was being revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, he got up smiling,  and the first word he said was, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!&#8217; Then my  Mother said to me, &#8216;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I replied, &#8216;By Allah, I  will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:&#8211;  &#8220;Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;  (24.11-20) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my  innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of  his relationship to him and his poverty, said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give to Mistah bin  Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.&#8217; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those among you who are good and wealthy  swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have  left their homes for Allah&#8217;s cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that  Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8216;Yes, by Allah, I would like that  Allah forgive me.&#8217; and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also  added, &#8216;By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at all.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha further said:.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked  Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, &#8216;What do you know and  what did you see?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain from claiming  falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about  &#8216;Aisha).&#8217; From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the  love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her  piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with  those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand  my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.&#8217; Later on the man  was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Ruman, the mother of &#8216;Aisha said that while &#8216;Aisha and  she were sitting, an Ansari woman came and said, &#8220;May Allah harm such and-such a  person!&#8221; Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;My son  was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).&#8221; Um Ruman said,  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; She said, &#8220;So-and-so&#8230;.&#8221; and narrated the whole  story. On that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle hear about that?&#8221; She replies,  &#8220;yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And Abu Bakr too?&#8221; She replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Aisha fell down fainting, and when she came to her senses, she  had got fever with rigors. I put her clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet came  and asked, &#8220;What is wrong with this (lady)?&#8221; Um Ruman replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! She (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) has got temperature with rigors.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Perhaps  it is because of the story that has been talked about?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha sat up and said, &#8220;By Allah, if I took an oath (that I am innocent), you would  not believe me, and if I said (that I am not innocent), you would not excuse me. My and  your example is like that of Jacob and his sons (as Jacob said ): &#8216;It is Allah (Alone)  Whose Help can be sought against that you assert.&#8217; Um Ruman said, &#8220;The Prophet then  went out saying nothing. Then Allah declared her innocence. On that, &#8216;Aisha said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;I thank Allah only; thank neither anybody else nor you.&#8221; </font></p>

We really consider  that the actual Victory was the Ar-Ridwan Pledge of allegiance which we gave on the day of  Al-Hudaibiya (to the Prophet) . On the day of Al-Hudaibiya we were fourteen hundred men  along with the Prophet Al-Hudaibiya was a well, the water of which we used up leaving not  a single drop of water in it. When the Prophet was informed of that, he came and sat on  its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his  mouth), invoked (Allah), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for  a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our  riding animals. </font></p>

When they informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle of that, he came and sat over  its edge and said, &#8220;Bring me a bucket of its water.&#8221; When it was brought, he  spat and invoked (Allah) and said, &#8220;Leave it for a while.&#8221; Then they quenched  their thirst and watered their riding animals (from that well) till they departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir said &#8220;On the day of Al-Hudaibiya, the people  felt thirsty and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a utensil containing water. He performer ablution  from it and then the people came towards him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; The people said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We haven&#8217;t got any water to perform ablution  with or to drink, except what you have in your utensil.&#8217; So the Prophet put his hand in  the utensil and the water started spouting out between his fingers like springs. So we  drank and performed ablution.&#8221; I said to Jabir, &#8220;What was your number on that  day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one hundred thousand, that water would  have been sufficient for us. Anyhow, we were 1500.&#8217; </font></p>

The Prophet proceeded on till he reached (a village called)  Ghadir-al-Ashtat. There his spy came and said, &#8220;The Quraish (infidels) have collected  a great number of people against you, and they have collected against you the Ethiopians,  and they will fight with you, and will stop you from entering the Ka&#8217;ba and prevent  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O people! Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I  should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka&#8217;ba? If  they should come to us (for peace) then Allah will destroy a spy from the pagans, or  otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) and  you do not want to kill or fight anybody. So proceed to it, and whoever should stop us  from it, we will fight him.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed on, in the Name  of Allah !&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama relating one of the events that happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the &#8216;Umra of  Al-Hudaibiya. They said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded the truce with Suhail bin  &#8216;Amr on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, one of the conditions which Suhail bin &#8216;Amr stipulated,  was his saying (to the Prophet), &#8220;If anyone from us (i.e. infidels) ever comes to  you, though he has embraced your religion, you should return him to us, and should not  interfere between us and him.&#8221; Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on this condition. The believers disliked this condition and got disgusted  with it and argued about it. But when Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on that condition, Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded it. Accordingly, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then returned Abu Jandal bin Suhail to his father, Suhail bin &#8216;Amr, and returned  every man coming to him from them during that period even if he was a Muslim. The  believing women Emigrants came (to Medina) and Um Kulthum, the daughter of &#8216;Uqba bin Abi  Mu&#8217;ait was one of those who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was an adult at that time. Her  relatives came, asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle to return her to them, and in this connection,  Allah revealed the Verses dealing with the believing (women). Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to test all the believing women who migrated to him, with the following  Verse:&#8211; &#8220;O Prophet! When the believing Women come to you, to give the pledge of  allegiance to you.&#8221; (60.12) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam  before &#8216;Umar. This is not true. What happened is that &#8216;Umar sent &#8216;Abdullah to bring his  horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the people were giving the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle near the Tree, and &#8216;Umar was not aware of that. So  Abdullah (bin Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the  horse and brought it to &#8216;Umar. While &#8216;Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for  fighting, &#8216;Abdullah informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beneath the Tree. So &#8216;Umar set out and &#8216;Abdullah accompanied him till he  gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and it was this event that made people  say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam before &#8216;Umar. &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar added,  &#8220;The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the  shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at  him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and looking at him.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge  o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of allegiance and returned to  &#8216;Umar who went out in his turn and gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet when he performed the  &#8216;Umra.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Sahl bin Hunaif returned from (the battle of) Siffin,  we went to ask him (as to why he had come back). He replied, &#8220;(You should not  consider me a coward) but blame your opinions. I saw myself on the day of Abu Jandal  (inclined to fight), and if I had the power of refusing the order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle then,  I would have refused it (and fought the infidels bravely). Allah and His Apostle know  (what is convenient) better. Whenever we put our swords on our shoulders for any matter  that terrified us, our swords led us to an easy agreeable solution before the present  situation (of disagreement and dispute between the Muslims). When we mend the breach in  one side, it opened in another, and we do not know what to do about it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people of the tribe of &#8216;Ukl and &#8216;Uraina arrived at  Medina to meet the Prophet and embraced Islam and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are  the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen).&#8221;  They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they  should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of  Medina and to drink the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they  reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the  shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he  sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet  ). The Prophet gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of  iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died  in that state of theirs. (See Hadith 234 Vol 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the  first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to graze at a place  called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me (on the way) and said,  &#8220;The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been taken away by force.&#8221; I asked,  &#8220;Who had taken them?&#8221; He replied &#8220;(The people of) Ghatafan.&#8221; I made  three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; I made the  people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up  with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as  I was a good archer and I was saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, and today will  perish the wicked people.&#8221; I kept on saying like that till I restored the she-camels  (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet  and the other people came there, and I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I have stopped the  people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people)  after them now.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;! You have  over-powered them, so forgive them.&#8221; Then we all came back and Allah&#8217;s Apostle seated  me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out in the company of the Prophet in the year of  Khaibar, and when we reached As Sahba&#8217; which is the lower part of Khaibar, the Prophet  offered the Asr prayer and then asked the people to collect the journey food. Nothing was  brought but Sawiq which the Prophet ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it  and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and  we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 509: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While  we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to &#8216;Amir, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Won&#8217;t you  let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for  the people poetry that kept pace with the camels&#8217; footsteps, saying:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!  Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In  charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our  defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon  us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An  unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others&#8217; help  Against us.&#8221; The Prophet on that, asked, &#8220;Who is that (camel) driver (reciting  poetry)?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on  him.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! has (martyrdom) been  granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; Then we reached and  besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims  conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the  Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &#8220;What are these fires? For cooking what,  are you making the fire?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;(For cooking) meat.&#8221; He  asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They (i.e. people) said, &#8220;The meat of  donkeys.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&#8221; Some  man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots  instead?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Yes, you can do) that too.&#8221; So when the army files  were arranged in rows (for the clash), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was short and he aimed at the leg of  a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own  knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw  me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &#8220;What is bothering you?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the  deeds of &#8216;Amir are lost.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so, is mistaken, for  &#8216;Amir has got a double reward.&#8221; The Prophet raised two fingers and added, &#8220;He  (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few &#8216;Arabs who  achieved the like of (good deeds) &#8216;Amir had done.&#8221; </font></p>

When it was morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when  they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, &#8220;Muhammad! By Allah! Muhammad and his  army!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a  (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been  warned.&#8221; </font></p>

Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile)  nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned.&#8221; We  then got the meat of donkeys (and intended to eat it), but an announcement was made by the  announcer of the Prophet, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle forbid you to eat the meat of  donkeys as it is an impure thing.&#8221; </font></p>

Somebody said, &#8220;None has benefited the Muslims today more than  so-and-so.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is from the people of the  Hell-Fire certainly.&#8221; A man amongst the people (i.e. Muslims) said, &#8220;I will  accompany him (to know the fact).&#8221; So he went along with him, and whenever he stopped  he stopped with him, and whenever he hastened, he hastened with him. The (brave) man then  got wounded severely, and seeking to die at once, he planted his sword into the ground and  put its point against his chest in between his breasts, and then threw himself on it and  committed suicide. On that the person (who was accompanying the deceased all the time)  came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Why is that (what makes you say so)?&#8221; He said &#8220;It is  concerning the man whom you have already mentioned as one of the dwellers of the  Hell-Fire. The people were surprised by your statement, and I said to them, &#8220;I will  try to find out the truth about him for you.&#8221; So I went out after him and he was then  inflicted with a severe wound and because of that, he hurried to bring death upon himself  by planting the handle of his sword into the ground and directing its tip towards his  chest between his breasts, and then he threw himself over it and committed suicide.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;A man may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the  dwellers of Paradise but he is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and another may do what  seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the  dwellers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

Some of the people were about to  doubt (the Prophet&#8217;s statement), but the man, feeling the pain of his wounds, put his hand  into his quiver and took out of it, some arrows with which he slaughtered himself (i.e.  committed suicide). Then some men amongst the Muslims came hurriedly and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true so-and-so has committed suicide.  &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;O so-and-so! Get up and make an announcement that none but a  believer will enter Paradise and that Allah may support the religion with an unchaste  (evil) wicked man. </font></p>

He then said, &#8220;(How can) I remain  behind the Prophet ,&#8221; and followed him. So when he slept on the night of the conquest  of Khaibar, the Prophet said, &#8220;I will give the flag tomorrow, or tomorrow the flag  will be taken by a man who is loved by Allah and His Apostle , and (Khaibar) will be  conquered through him, (with Allah&#8217;s help)&#8221; While every one of us was hopeful to have  the flag, it was said, &#8220;Here is &#8216;Ali&#8221; and the Prophet gave him the flag and  Khaibar was conquered through him (with Allah&#8217;s Help). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Khaibar, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow  I will give this flag to a man through whose hands Allah will give us victory. He loves  Allah and His Apostle, and he is loved by Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The people remained  that night, wondering as to who would be given it. In the morning the people went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and everyone of them was hopeful to receive it (i.e. the flag). The  Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;He is suffering  from eye trouble O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him.&#8221; &#8216;Ali was  brought and Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat in his eye and invoked good upon him. So &#8216;Ali was cured  as if he never had any trouble. Then the Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will fight with them till they become like us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Proceed and do not hurry. When you enter their territory, call them to embrace  Islam and inform them of Allah&#8217;s Rights which they should observe, for by Allah, even if a  single man is led on the right path (of Islam) by Allah through you, then that will be  better for you than the nice red camels. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We arrived at Khaibar, and when Allah helped His Apostle to  open the fort, the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtaq whose husband had been killed  while she was a bride, was mentioned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet selected her for  himself, and set out with her, and when we reached a place called Sidd-as-Sahba,&#8217; Safiya  became clean from her menses then Allah&#8217;s Apostle married her. Hais (i.e. an &#8216;Arabian  dish) was prepared on a small leather mat. Then the Prophet said to me, &#8220;I invite the  people around you.&#8221; So that was the marriage banquet of the Prophet and Safiya. Then  we proceeded towards Medina, and I saw the Prophet, making for her a kind of cushion with  his cloak behind him (on his camel). He then sat beside his camel and put his knee for  Safiya to put her foot on, in order to ride (on the camel). </font></p>

I invited the Muslim to h s marriage banquet and there  wa neither meat nor bread in that banquet but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the  leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put. The Muslims said amongst  themselves, &#8220;Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one  of the wives of the Prophet ) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand  possesses&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then  she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet&#8217;s wives), and if  he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave.&#8221; So when he  departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his and made her observe the veil. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to  Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were  (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu  Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my  people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met  Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet  at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the  people of the ship, &#8220;We have migrated before you.&#8221; Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who was one  of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had  migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. &#8216;Umar came to Hafsa while  Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais was with her. &#8216;Umar, on seeing Asma,&#8217; said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She  said, &#8220;Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais,&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the  sea-faring lady?&#8221; Asma&#8217; replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We have migrated  before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah&#8217;s Apostle  &#8221; On that Asma&#8217; became angry and said, &#8220;No, by Allah, while you were with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones  amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I  will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add  something to it.&#8221; So when the Prophet came, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet &#8216;Umar  has said so-and-so.&#8221; He said (to Asma&#8217;), &#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221; Asma&#8217;s  aid, &#8220;I told him so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. &#8216;Umar) has not got  more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one  migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations.&#8221;  Asma&#8217; later on said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in  successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was  more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Asma&#8217; said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa  requesting me to repeat this narration again and again.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur&#8217;an,  when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their  voices when they are reciting the Qur&#8217;an at night although I have not seen their houses  when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Hakim who, on meeting the  cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to  wait for them.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

While the slave was  dismounting the saddle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an arrow the thrower of which was unknown, came  and hit him. The people said, &#8220;Congratulations to him for the martyrdom.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the sheet (of cloth)  which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before the  distribution of the booty, has become a flame of Fire burning him.&#8221; On hearing that,  a man brought one or two leather straps of shoes to the Prophet and said, &#8220;These are  things I took (illegally).&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This is a strap, or  these are two straps of Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 546: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr  (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the  property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in  Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr  said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave,  is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.&#8217; By Allah, I  will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and will leave it  as it was during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to do.&#8221; So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she  became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died.  She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her  husband &#8216;Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral  prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect &#8216;Ali much, but after  her death, &#8216;Ali noticed a change in the people&#8217;s attitude towards him. So Ali sought  reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. &#8216;Ali had not given the  oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet&#8217;s death and  Fatima&#8217;s death). &#8216;Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;Come to us, but let nobody  come with you,&#8221; as he disliked that &#8216;Umar should come, &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr),  &#8220;No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;What  do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them&#8217; So Abu Bakr entered upon  them, and then &#8216;Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;We know well your  superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah  has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we  thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  .&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thereupon Abu Bakr&#8217;s eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu  Bakr spoke, he said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the  relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own  relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I  will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or  regulation which I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will  follow.&#8221; On that &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;I promise to give you the oath of  allegiance in this after noon.&#8221; So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he  ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of &#8216;Ali and  his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had  offered; Then &#8216;Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud,  praised Abu Bakr&#8217;s right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of  jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. &#8216;Ali added,  &#8220;But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and  that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel  sorry.&#8221; On that all the Muslims became happy and said, &#8220;You have done the right  thing.&#8221; The Muslims then became friendly with &#8216;Ali as he returned to what the people  had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went out for the &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhal-Qa&#8217;da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to  conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days  only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote:  &#8220;This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The infidels said (to the Prophet), &#8220;We do not agree  with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented  you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Erase (the name of) &#8216;Apostle of Allah&#8217;.&#8221;  &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the writing sheet&#8230;and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got  it the following written! &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah, has concluded: &#8220;Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed  swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a  person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he  should not forbid him.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the  allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said &#8220;Tell your  companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished.&#8221; So  the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting &#8220;O  Uncle, O Uncle!&#8221; Ali took her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take the daughter  of your uncle.&#8221; So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) &#8216;Ali,  Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarreled about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I took her for she is the daughter  of my uncle.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my  wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my brother.&#8221; On that, the Prophet  gave her to her aunt and said, &#8220;The aunt is of the same status as the mother.&#8221;  He then said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;You are from me, and I am from you,&#8221; and said to Ja&#8217;far,  &#8220;You resemble me in appearance and character,&#8221; and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are  our brother and our freed slave.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said to the Prophet &#8216;Won&#8217;t you marry the  daughter of Hamza?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my foster  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

So the Prophet performed the  &#8216;Umra in the following year and according to the peace treaty, he entered Mecca, and when  he had stayed there for three days, the infidels ordered him to leave, and he left. </font></p>

The only cause  which prevented the Prophet from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was  that he pitied them. </font></p>

The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi  Balta&#8217;a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to do.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish  but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the  Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their  families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my  relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my  religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to his companions.&#8221; As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the  truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this  hypocrite!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. Hatib) has witnessed the Badr battle  (i.e. fought in it) and what could tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who witnessed  Badr and said, &#8220;O the people of Badr (i.e. Badr Muslim warriors), do what you like,  for I have forgiven you. &#8220;Then Allah revealed the Sura:&#8211; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out (towards Mecca) during the  year of the Conquest (of Mecca) and this news reached (the infidels of Quraish), Abu  Sufyan, Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqa came out to gather information about Allah&#8217;s  Apostle , They proceeded on their way till they reached a place called Marr-az-Zahran  (which is near Mecca). Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of  Arafat. Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;What is this? It looked like the fires of Arafat.&#8221;  Budail bin Warqa&#8217; said, &#8220;Banu &#8216;Amr are less in number than that.&#8221; Some of the  guards of Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw them and took them over, caught them and brought them to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet proceeded, he said to Al-Abbas, &#8220;Keep  Abu Sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the Muslims. So  Al-&#8216;Abbas kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes with the Prophet started  passing in front of Abu Sufyan in military batches. A batch passed and Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas Who are these?&#8221; &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;They are (Banu) Ghifar.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, I have got nothing to do with Ghifar.&#8221; Then (a batch of the tribe of)  Juhaina passed by and he said similarly as above. Then (a batch of the tribe of) Sad bin  Huzaim passed by and he said similarly as above. then (Banu) Sulaim passed by and he said  similarly as above. Then came a batch, the like of which Abu Sufyan had not seen. He said,  &#8220;Who are these?&#8221; Abbas said, &#8220;They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada,  the one holding the flag.&#8221; Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day  of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka&#8217;ba will be permissible.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan said., &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas! How excellent the day of destruction is! &#8220;Then came  another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair  bin Al Awwam. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Do you know what Sad bin &#8216;Ubada said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What  did he say?&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Sad told a lie, but today Allah will give superiority to the Ka&#8217;ba and today the  Ka&#8217;ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that his flag  be fixed at Al-Hajun. </font></p>

Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle  order you to fix the flag here?&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to  enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka&#8217;da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.

Allow me to tell you a statement which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the second day of the Conquest of Mecca. My two ears heard it and  my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it. He (i.e. the Prophet)  praised Allah and then said, &#8216;Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Allah and not by the  people, so it is not lawful for a person, who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed  blood in it, or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in Mecca  because Allah&#8217;s Apostle was allowed to fight in it, say to him; Allah permitted His  Apostle and did not allow you, and even he (i.e. the Apostle) was allowed for a short  period of the day, and today its (Mecca&#8217;s sanctity has become the same as it was before  (of old) so those who are present should inform those who are absent (this Hadith).&#8221;  Then Abu Shuraih, was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr say to you?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people,  and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, &#8220;What is wrong with the  people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, &#8220;That man  claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that  Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&#8221; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and  feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the &#8216;Arabs (other than Quraish)  delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.&#8221;  &#8220;Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a  true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and  my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father  returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &#8220;By Allah, I have come to you from  the Prophet for sure!&#8221; The Prophet afterwards said to them, &#8216;Offer such-and-such  prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of  you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows  Qur&#8217;an most should, lead the prayer.&#8221; So they looked for such a person and found none  who knew more Qur&#8217;an than I because of the Quranic material which I used to learn from the  caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a  boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very  short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t  you cover the anus of your reciter for us?&#8221; So they bought (a piece of cloth) and  made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that  shirt. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The boy is for the bed (i.e. for the owner of the bed where  he was born), and stone is for the adulterer.&#8221; (Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Huraira  used to say that (i.e. the last statement of the Prophet in the above Hadith 596,  publicly.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A lady committed theft during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle in the Ghazwa of Al-Fath, ((i.e. Conquest of Mecca). Her folk went to Usama bin  Zaid to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama interceded for her with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;Do you  intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by  Allah?&#8221; Usama said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; So  in the afternoon, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He  deserved and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because  if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them  stole, they would apply (Allah&#8217;s) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s  soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off.  Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;That lady  used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah&#8217;s Apostle </font></p>

The people of  Hawazin were good archers, and when we attacked them, they fled. But rushing towards the  booty, we were confronted by the arrows (of the enemy).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegate of Hawazin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  declaring their conversion to Islam and asked him to return their properties and captives,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and said to them, &#8220;There Is involved in this matter, the  people whom you see with me, and the most beloved talk to me, is the true one. So choose  one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for  you (i.e. have not distributed the booty).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had delayed the  distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta&#8217;if. So when they came  to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to return to them but one of the two, they  said, &#8220;We prefer to have our captives.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amongst the  Muslims, and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed! Your brothers have  come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever  of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to  his share till we give him from the very first booty which Allah will give us, then he can  do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We do that (i.e. return the captives) willingly as a  favor, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We do not know which of you  have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your  decision.&#8221; They went back and their chief&#8217;s spoke to them, and they (i.e. the chiefs)  returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him that all of them had agreed (to give up their  captives) with pleasure, and had given their permission (i.e. that the captives be  returned to their people).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the  battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the  Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans  over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his  armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as  if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed &#8216;Umar  and said to him, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the Order  of Allah.&#8221; Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after  overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Whoever had killed an Infidel and  has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g.  clothes, arms, horse, etc).&#8221; I (stood up) and said, &#8220;Who will be my  witness?&#8221; and then sat down. Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet  said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be my witness?&#8221;  and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet  said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?&#8221; So I narrated the whole story; A man said,  &#8220;Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please  compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No! By Allah, it will never  happen that the Prophet will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah and  His Apostle and give his spoils to you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken  the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!&#8221; So he gave it to me and I  bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the  first property I got after embracing Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qatada: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a  Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the  Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the  Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off.  That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then  he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims  (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with  them. Suddenly I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, &#8220;What  is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the order of Allah&#8221; Then the  people returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the  killed man.&#8221; So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an  infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came  to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. A man  from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, &#8220;The arms of the  deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate  him for it (i.e. the spoils),&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, Allah&#8217;s Apostle will not give  it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah&#8217;s Lions  who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and gave  that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got  after embracing Islam. </font></p>

The Prophet sent me with Abu  &#8216;Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and  fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, &#8220;O Uncle! Who shot you?&#8221; He pointed  me out (his killer) saying, &#8220;That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow).&#8221; So  I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and  started saying to him, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be ashamed? Won&#8217;t you stop?&#8221; So that person  stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu  &#8216;Amir. &#8220;Allah has killed your killer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take out this arrow&#8221;  So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, &#8220;O son of my  brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for me.&#8221; Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He  survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet  at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with  ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back  and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir&#8217;s news and how he had said  &#8220;Tell him to ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; The Prophet asked for water,  performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Forgive &#8216;Ubaid, Abu  Amir.&#8221; At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet&#8217;s armpits. The Prophet then  said, &#8220;O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many  of Your human creatures.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for  me?&#8221; (On that) the Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah, forgive the sins of &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;  Abu Burda said, &#8220;One of the prayers was for Abu &#8216;Amir and the other was for Abu Musa  (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais).&#8221; </font></p>

A  bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you fulfill what you have promised  me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Rejoice (at what I will do for you).&#8217; The bedouin said,  &#8220;(You have said to me) rejoice too often.&#8221; Then the Prophet turned to me (i.e.  Abu Musa) and Bilal in an angry mood and said, &#8216;The bedouin has refused the good tidings,  so you both accept them.&#8217; Bilal and I said, &#8216;We accept them.&#8217; Then the Prophet asked for a  drinking bowl containing water and washed his hands and face in it, and then took a  mouthful of water and threw it therein saying (to us), &#8220;Drink (some of) it and pour  (some) over your faces and chests and be happy at the good tidings.&#8221; So they both  took the drinking bowl and did as instructed. Um Salama called from behind a screen,  &#8220;Keep something (of the water for your mother.&#8221; So they left some of it for her.  </font></p>

He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle !

The Ansar said, &#8220;When there is a difficulty, we are  called, but the booty is given to other than us.&#8221; The news reached the Prophet and he  gathered them in a leather tent and said, &#8220;What is this news reaching me from you, O  the group of Ansar?&#8221; They kept silent, He added,&#8221; O the group of Ansar!

Saba&#8217;na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another).&#8221; Khalid kept on killing  (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen.  He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Facilitate things for the people and do not make things  difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard  on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to  carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near  (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once  Mu&#8217;adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his  companion Abu Musa. Mu&#8217;adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him  sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his  hands behind his neck. Mu&#8217;adh said to Abu Musa, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! What is  this?&#8221; Abu Musa replied. &#8220;This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing  Islam.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; Abu Musa  replied, &#8220;He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said,  &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed,  and he was killed. Then Mu&#8217;adh dismounted and said, &#8220;O Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do  you recite the Qur&#8217;an ?&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;I recite the Qur&#8217;an regularly at  intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu&#8217;adh?&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I sleep  in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for  my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me.

In our land there is an alcoholic drink (prepared)  from barley called Al-Mizr, and another (prepared) from honey, called Al-Bit&#8221;&#8216; The  Prophet said, &#8220;All intoxicants are prohibited.&#8221; Then both of them proceeded and  Mu&#8217;adh asked Abu Musa, &#8220;How do you recite the Quran?&#8221; Abu Musa replied, &#8220;I  recite it while I am standing, sitting or riding my riding animals, at intervals and  piecemeal.&#8221; Muadh said, &#8220;But I sleep and then get up. I sleep and hope for  Allah&#8217;s Reward for my sleep as I seek His Reward for my night prayer.&#8221; Then he (i.e.  Muadh) pitched a tent and they started visiting each other.

Shall I chop his  neck off?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, for he may offer prayers.&#8221; Khalid said,  &#8220;Numerous are those who offer prayers and say by their tongues (i.e. mouths) what is  not in their hearts.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have not been ordered (by Allah)  to search the hearts of the people or cut open their bellies.&#8221; Then the Prophet  looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was going away and said, &#8220;From the  offspring of this (man there will come out (people) who will recite the Qur&#8217;an  continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will neither  understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e. Islam) as an arrow  goes through a game&#8217;s body.&#8221; I think he also said, &#8220;If I should be present at  their time I would kill them as the nations a Thamud were killed.&#8221; </font></p>

I proceeded with one-hundred and-fifty cavalry  from Ahmas (tribe) who were horse riders. I used not to sit firm on horses, so the Prophet  stroke me over my chest till I saw the mark of his fingers over my chest, and then he  said, &#8216;O Allah! Make him (i.e. Jarir) firm and one who guides others and is guided on the  right path.&#8221; So Jarir proceeded to it dismantled and burnt it, and then sent a  messenger to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The messenger of Jarir said (to the Prophet), &#8220;By Him  Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave that place till it was like a scabby  camel.&#8221; The Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times. </font></p>

I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet of that,  and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he  said, O Allah! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).&#8217;  Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l&#8211;Khulasa was a house in Yemen  belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were  worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and  dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give  good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &#8220;The messenger of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your  neck.&#8221; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped  there and said to him, &#8220;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the  right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&#8221; So the man  broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah.  Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey  the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till  it was like a scabby camel.&#8221; Then the Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their  men five times. </font></p>

Dhu Amr said to me,  &#8220;If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has  died three days ago.&#8221; Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had  covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We  asked them and they said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed  as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.&#8217; Then they said, &#8220;Tell your friend  (Abu Bakr) that we have come (to visit him), and if Allah will, we will come again.&#8221;  So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr their statement, he said to me,  &#8220;I wish you had brought them (to me).&#8221; Afterwards I met Dhu Amr, and he said to  me, &#8220;O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e.  you, the nation of &#8216;Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint  another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of  the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and  will be delighted as kings get delighted.&#8221; </font></p>

We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food  ran short. So Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected,  and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our  daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that  we did not receive except a date each.&#8221; I asked (Jabir), &#8220;How could one date  benefit you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We came to know its value when even that finished.&#8221;  Jabir added, &#8220;Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small  mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida  ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a  she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching  them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us who were three-hundred riders under  the command of Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah in order to watch the caravan of the Quraish  pagans. We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger  that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and  because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal  (i.e. a fish) called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on  our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and  healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the  tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, &#8220;He  took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from  underneath it (without touching it). &#8221; Jabir added: There was a man amongst the  people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then  slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so. </font></p>

He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered  (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt  hungry again.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais  said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;But I was  forbidden (by Abu &#8216;Ubaida this time).&#8221; </font></p>

Um Salama replied, &#8216;I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of  these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at  that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet )  offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, &#8216;Stand beside him  and say (to him): Um Salama says, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Didn&#8217;t I hear you forbidding the  offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?&#8217; And if he  beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.&#8217; So the lady slave did that and the  Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished  his prayer, he said, &#8216;O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me  about these two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of &#8216;Abdul  Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat  which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me  offering) make up for those.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8220;What I told you, i.e. if you set  me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.&#8221; The Prophet left him till the  day after, when he said, &#8220;What have you got, O Thumama?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  got what I told you. &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Release Thumama.&#8221; So he  (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and  then entered the Mosque and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped  except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There  was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face  has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by  me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town  most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your  cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the &#8216;Umra. And now what  do you think?&#8221; The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him  to perform the &#8216;Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, &#8220;You have become  a Sabian?&#8221; Thumama replied, &#8220;No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad,  Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica  unless the Prophet gives his permission.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Musailima Al-Kadhdhab came during the lifetime of the  Prophet and started saying, &#8220;If Muhammad gives me the rule after him, I will follow  him.&#8221; And he came to Medina with a great number of the people of his tribe. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet )  stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him,  &#8220;If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah&#8217;s  Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this  religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown  to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my  behalf.&#8221; Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle : &#8220;You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,&#8221; and  Abu Huraira informed me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw (in a  dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired  Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles  flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would  appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to worship stones, and when we found a better stone  than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we could not  get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and then bring a sheep and milk  that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used  (to stop the military actions), calling this month the iron remover, for we used to remove  and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow in the month of Rajab. Abu Raja&#8217;  added: When the Prophet sent with (Allah&#8217;s) Message, I was a boy working as a shepherd of  my family camels. When we heard the news about the appearance of the Prophet, we ran to  the fire, i.e. to Musailima al-Kadhdhab. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in  Medina and stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of Al-Harith bin  Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir. There came to him  Allah&#8217;s Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet stopped before  Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, &#8220;If you wish, we would not  interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you&#8230;  The Prophet said, &#8220;If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I  think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin  Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf.&#8221; The Prophet then went away. I asked Ibn  Abbas about the dream Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned. Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Someone told me  that the Prophet said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw in a dream that two gold bangles  were put in my hands, and that frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed  to blow on them, and when I blew at them, both of them flew. Then I interpreted them as  two liars who would appear.&#8217; One of them was Al-&#8216;Ansi who was killed by Fairuz in Yemen  and the other was Musailima Al-Kadhdbab.&#8221; </font></p>

But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to  announce, &#8220;Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present  himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet had  said (to me), &#8220;If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and  so much,&#8221; repeating &#8220;so much&#8221; thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another  narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the  Prophet had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give  me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to  him, &#8220;I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give  me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or  else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you say, &#8216;You are like  a miserly to me?&#8217; There is no worse disease than miserliness.&#8221; Abu Bakr said it  thrice and added, &#8220;Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving  you.&#8221; (In another narration) Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (and  he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it  five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), &#8220;Take the same amount twice.&#8221; </font></p>

We, a group  of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin people went to the Prophet and asked him to give us something to ride,  but the Prophet refused. Then we asked him for the second time to give us something to  ride, but the Prophet took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride. After a  while, some camels of booty were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that five camels be  given to us. When we took those camels we said, &#8220;We have made the Prophet forget his  oath, and we will not be successful after that.&#8221; So I went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle ! You took an oath that you would not give us anything to ride, but  you have given us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for if I take an oath and later I see a  better solution than that, I act on the later (and gave the expiation of that oaths&#8221; </font></p>

The  Prophet said, &#8220;Did you assume the Ihram for Hajj?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He  said, &#8220;How did you express your intention (for performing Hajj)? &#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik (i.e. I am ready) to assume the Ihram with the same intention as that of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and  between Safa and Marwa, and then finish your Ihram.&#8221; So I performed the Tawaf around  the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then I came to a woman from the tribe of Qais who  removed the lice from my head. </font></p>

She asked, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s ordained obligation  (i.e. compulsory Hajj) enjoined on His slaves has become due on my old father who cannot  sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be sufficient if I perform the Hajj on his  behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) in the year of the Conquest  (of Mecca) while Usama was riding behind him on (his she-camel)&#8217;. Al-Qaswa.&#8217; Bilal and  &#8216;Uthman bin Talha were accompanying him. When he made his she-camel kneel down near the  Ka&#8217;ba, he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Get us the key (of the Ka&#8217;ba). He brought the key to him  and opened the gate (of the Ka&#8217;ba), for him. The Prophet, Usama, Bilal and &#8216;Uthman (bin  Talha) entered the Ka&#8217;ba and then closed the gate behind them (from inside). The Prophet  stayed there for a long period and then came out. The people rushed to get in, but I went  in before them and found Bilal standing behind the gate, and I said to him, &#8220;Where  did the Prophet pray?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He prayed between those two front  pillars.&#8221; The Ka&#8217;ba was built on six pillars, arranged in two rows, and he prayed  between the two pillars of the front row leaving the gate of the Ka&#8217;ba at his back and  facing (in prayer) the wall which faces one when one enters the Ka&#8217;ba. Between him and  that wall (was the distance of about three cubits). But I forgot to ask Bilal about the  number of Rakat the Prophet had prayed. There was a red piece of marble at the place where  he (i.e. the Prophet) had offered the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were talking about Hajjat-ul-Wada, while the Prophet was  amongst us. We did not know what Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; signified. The Prophet praised Allah and  then mentioned Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal and described him extensively, saying, &#8220;Allah did  not send any prophet but that prophet warned his nation of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. Noah and  the prophets following him warned (their people) of him. He will appear amongst you (O  Muhammad&#8217;s followers), and if it happens that some of his qualities may be hidden from  you, but your Lord&#8217;s State is clear to you and not hidden from you. The Prophet said it  thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in  the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Allah has  made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of  yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours.&#8221; The Prophet added: No doubt!  Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; The  Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has taken its original shape  which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is of twelve months,  four of which are sacred, and out of these (four) three are in succession, i.e.  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab which is named after the  Mudar tribe, between (the month of) Jumaida (ath-thania) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; Then the  Prophet asked, &#8220;Which is this month?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; On that the Prophet kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it  with another name. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We  replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; &#8220;We replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; On that he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the town of  Mecca?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, &#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which day is today?&#8221;  We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of  An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So your blood,  your properties, (The sub-narrator Muhammad said, &#8216;I think the Prophet also said: And your  honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of  yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you  about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one  another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to  those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will  understand it better than those who have actually heard it.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Muhammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, &#8220;Muhammad spoke the  truth!&#8221;) He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed  (Allah&#8217;s Message) to you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet visited me during Hajjat ul-Wada&#8217; while I was  suffering from a disease which brought me to the verge of death. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! My ailment has reached such a (bad) state as you see, and I have much wealth, but  I have no-one to inherit from me except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property  as alms (in charity)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Shall I give  half of my property as alms?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;(Shall I give)  1/3 of it? &#8221; He replied, &#8221; 1/3, and even 1/3 is too much. It is better for you  to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging people (for their  sustenance); and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s Sake, you will get reward for it even for  the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to  Medina)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you remain behind, any good deed which you will  do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that  some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you.&#8221;  The Prophet then added, &#8220;O Allah! Complete the Migration of my companions and do not  turn them on their heels. But the poor Sad bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sad) (died  in Mecca) .&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle pitied Sad for he died in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My Companions sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him for  some animals to ride on as they were accompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was  the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! My companions have sent me  to you to provide them with means of transportation.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah! I will  not make you ride anything.&#8221; It happened that when I reached him, he was in an angry  mood, and I didn&#8217;t notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the  Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become &#8216;angry with me. So I returned  to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had  passed when I heard Bilal calling, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!&#8221; I replied to his  call. Bilal said, &#8220;Respond to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is calling you.&#8221; When I went  to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, &#8220;Take these two camels tied together and also  these two camels tied together,&#8221;&#8216; referring to six camels he had brought them from  Sad at that time. The Prophet added, &#8220;Take them to your companions and say, &#8216;Allah  (or Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) allows you to ride on these,&#8217; so ride on them.&#8221; So I took those  camels to them and said, &#8220;The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels) but by  Allah, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to somebody who heard the  statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Allah&#8217;s  Apostle has not said.&#8221; They said to me, &#8220;We consider you truthful, and we will  do what you like.&#8221; The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of  them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle wherein he  denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same.  So these people told them the same information as Abu Musa had told them. </font></p>

So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter&#8217;s claim as invalid (i.e.  the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet said, &#8220;Should  he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a  male camel to snap it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he  became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which  he failed to take part. Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any  Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa  of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them  (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of  Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not  exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the  people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had  never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that  Ghazwa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then  at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to  hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of  that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long  journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims  clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he  informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied  by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221;  Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would  remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle  fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in  order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would  say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the  people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had  not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure)  one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure,  I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next  morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the  battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had  done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I  went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I  could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah  had excused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was  sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his  looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you  have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle kept silent.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the  Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of  false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the  advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle,  had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I  could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly  to speak the truth. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned  from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer  therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who  had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and  taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the  excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and  when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I  came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had  you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other  than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking  fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek  your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell  you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.  Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or  wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards  this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up,  and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you  doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the  others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to  forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so  much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie,  but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of  them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied,  Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me  two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an  example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all  those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they  changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to  me as if I did not know it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards  my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest  of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with  the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and  I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not.  Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with  my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would  turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked  till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to  me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,  &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He  kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I  asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it  better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the  wall.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw  a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in  Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out  for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the  following was written: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend  (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a  place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console  you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a  test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When  forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her  and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said  to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this  matter.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on  him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he  should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah,  he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you  also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife  of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked  him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217; Then I remained in that state for  ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the  time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the  Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting  in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened  to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the  voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab  bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah,  realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our  repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to  congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman  came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and  his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came  to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by  Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and  wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating  me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s  Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I  saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came  to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e.  Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for  Talha.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright  with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother  delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you  or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy,  his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of  him. When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my  repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has  saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth  as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped  fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from  telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin  (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and  deed).&#8221; (9.117-119) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His  guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for  Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to  anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you  when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the  rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed  altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He  took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left  our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to  the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our  failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by  the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before  him and he excused them by accepting their excuses. </font></p>

Al-Mughira  added. &#8220;The Prophet washed his face, and when he wanted to wash his forearms, the  sleeves of his cloak became tight over them, so he took them out from underneath the cloak  and then he washed them (i.e. his forearms) and passed wet hands over his Khuffs.&#8221; </font></p>

Some  said, &#8220;What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask  him ( to understand his state ).&#8221; So they went to the Prophet and asked him again.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me  for.&#8221; Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of  the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen  me dealing with them.&#8221; (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn Abbas kept  quiet as rewards the third order, or he said, &#8220;I forgot it.&#8221;) (See Hadith No.  116 Vol. 1) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Book is  sufficient for us.&#8217; So the people in the house differed and started disputing. Some of  them said, &#8216;Give him writing material so that he may write for you something after which  you will not go astray.&#8217; while the others said the other way round. So when their talk and  differences increased, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Get up.&#8221; Ibn Abbas used to say,  &#8220;No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah &#8216;s Apostle was in good health, he used to say,  &#8220;Never does a prophet die unless he is shown his place in Paradise ( before his death  ), and then he is made alive or given option.&#8221; When the Prophet became ill and his  last moments came while his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious, and when he came  to his senses, he looked towards the roof of the house and then said, &#8220;O Allah!  (Please let me be) with the highest companion.&#8221; Thereupon I said, &#8220;Hence he is  not going to stay with us? &#8221; Then I came to know that his state was the confirmation  of the narration he used to mention to us while he was in good health. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at it, so I took the Siwak, cut it  (chewed it with my teeth), shook it and made it soft (with water), and then gave it to the  Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it. I had never seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle cleaning his teeth  in a better way. After finishing the brushing of his teeth, he lifted his hand or his  finger and said thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Let me be with the highest companions,&#8221; and  then died. &#8216;Aisha used to say, &#8220;He died while his head was resting between my chest  and chin.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;When the ailment of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle became aggravated, he requested his wives to permit him to be (treated) nursed in  my house, and they gave him permission. He came out (to my house), walking between two men  with his feet dragging on the ground, between &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul&#8211;Muttalib and another  man&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Abdullah of what &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Abbas said to me, &#8216;Do you know who is the other man whom &#8216;Aisha did not name?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;No.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;It was &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet  used to narrate saying, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered my house and his disease became  aggravated, he said, &#8221; Pour on me the water of seven water skins, the mouths of which  have not been untied, so that I may give advice to the people.&#8217; So we let him sit in a big  basin belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and then started to pour water on him  from these water skins till he started pointing to us with his hands intending to say,  &#8216;You have done your job.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Then he went out to the people and led  them in prayer and preached to them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle became ill seriously, he started covering his face with his  woolen sheet, and when he felt short of breath, he removed it from hi; face and said,  &#8216;That is so! Allah&#8217;s (curse be on the Jews and the Christians, as they took the graves of  their prophets as (places of worship),&#8217; intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had  done.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I argued with Allah&#8217;s Apostle repeatedly about that matter  (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer in his place when he was  ill), and what made me argue so much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after  the Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place, and I felt that  anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen to the people, so I wanted Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to give up the idea of choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. Ali)! How is the  health of Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali replied, &#8220;He has recovered with  the Grace of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him,  &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the  offspring of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as  to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new  ruler to take care of us.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for  it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after  that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer on Monday  and Abu Bakr was leading them in prayer, suddenly Allah&#8217;s Apostle lifted the curtain of  &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling and looked at them while they were in the rows of the prayers and  smiled. Abu Bakr retreated to join the row, thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come  out for the prayer. The Muslims were about to be put to trial in their prayer (i.e. were  about to give up praying) because of being overjoyed at seeing Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned them with his hand to complete their prayer and then entered the  dwelling and let fall the curtain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was one of the favors of Allah towards me that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest  and Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman entered upon me  with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle (against my  chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak,  so I said ( to him ), &#8220;Shall I take it for you ? &#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I  took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, &#8220;Shall I soften it for you  ?&#8221; He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it. In  front of him there was a jug or a tin, (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Umar is in doubt as to which  was right) containing water. He started dipping his hand in the water and rubbing his face  with it, he said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Death has its  agonies.&#8221; He then lifted his hands (towards the sky) and started saying, &#8220;With  the highest companion,&#8221; till he expired and his hand dropped down. </font></p>

Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221;, seeking &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  turn. His wives allowed him to stay wherever he wished. So he stayed at &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house  till he expired while he was with her.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;The Prophet expired on  the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my  chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu  Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at  it and I said to him, &#8216;O &#8216;AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.&#8217; So he gave it to me and I cut  it, chewed it (it&#8217;s end) and gave it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who cleaned his teeth with it  while he was resting against my chest.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet expired in my house and on the day of my turn,  leaning against my chest. One of us (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s wives ) used to recite a prayer  asking Allah to protect him from all evils when he became sick. So I started asking Allah  to protect him from all evils (by reciting a prayer ). He raised his head towards the sky  and said, &#8220;With the highest companions, with the highest companions.&#8221;  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr passed carrying a fresh leaf-stalk of a date-palm and the  Prophet looked at it and I thought that the Prophet was in need of it (for cleaning his  teeth ). So I took it (from &#8216;Abdur Rahman) and chewed its head and shook it and gave it to  the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it, in the best way he had ever cleaned his teeth,  and then he gave it to me, and suddenly his hand dropped down or it fell from his hand  (i.e. he expired). So Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva on his last day on earth  and his first day in the Hereafter. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh on a horse. He  dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon  &#8216;Aisha and went straight to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind  of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet&#8217;s face and bowed over him and kissed him  and wept, saying, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah  will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come  upon you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Abu Bakr went out while Umar bin  Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Sit down, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But  &#8216;Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad , then Muhammad is dead,  but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.  Allah said:&#8211;&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have  passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )&#8230;&#8230;Allah will reward to those who  are thankful.&#8221; (3.144) By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had  revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from  him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: Said bin Al-Musaiyab told me that &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and  I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had  died.&#8221; </font></p>
