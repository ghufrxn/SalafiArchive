<h3 align="center">Prophetic Commentary on the Qur&#8217;an(Tafseer of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam))</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.060.001"></a>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said bin Al-Mu&#8217;alla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called me but I did not respond to him. Later I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say&#8217;&#8211;&#8220;Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you.&#8221; (8.24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said to me, &#8220;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Qur&#8217;an, before you leave the Mosque.&#8221; Then he got hold of my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say to me, &#8216;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Quran?&#8217; He said, &#8220;Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab&#8217;a Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur&#8217;an which has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Imam says: &#8216;Ghair-il-Maghdubi &#8216;Alaihim Walad-Dallin (i.e. not the path of those who earn Your Anger, nor the path of those who went astray (1.7)), then you must say, &#8216;Ameen&#8217;, for if one&#8217;s utterance of &#8216;Ameen&#8217; coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &#8216;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&#8217; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &#8216;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&#8217; They will go to him and Noah will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &#8216;Go to the Khalil&#8211;r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&#8217; They will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&#8217; So they will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&#8217;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&#8217;s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.&#8217; (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, &#8216;None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.&#8217; &#8221; (The compiler) Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;But those whom the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned in Hell,&#8217; refers to the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will dwell therein forever.&#8221; (16.29)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the greatest sin in the Sight of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That you set up a rival unto Allah though He Alone created you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is indeed a great sin.&#8221; Then asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Kam&#8217;a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;It was said to the children of Israel, &#8216;Enter the gate (of the town), prostrate (in humility) and say: Hittatun (i.e. repentance) i.e. O Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgive our sins.&#8217; But they entered by dragging themselves on their buttocks, so they did something different (from what they had been ordered to do) and said, &#8216;Hittatun,&#8217; but added, &#8220;A grain in a hair.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8220;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Gabriel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission.&#8221; (2.97) Then he added, &#8220;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&#8221; On hearing that, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&#8221; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &#8220;What is &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s status amongst you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;May Allah protect him from this!&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah came out and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The Jews then said, &#8220;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&#8221; and disparaged him. On that &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;Our best Qur&#8217;an reciter is Ubai and our best judge is &#8216;Ali; and in spite of this, we leave some of the statements of Ubai because Ubai says, &#8216;I do not leave anything that I have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle while Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whatever verse (Revelations) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We bring a better one or similar to it.&#8221; (2.106)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is that he claims that I cannot recreate him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me, it is his statement that I have offspring. No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;I agreed with Allah in three things,&#8221; or said, &#8220;My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.&#8217; I also said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.&#8217; So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, &#8216;You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.&#8217; When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle haven&#8217;t what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?&#8217; &#8221; Thereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..&#8221; (66.5)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that when your people built the Ka&#8217;ba, they did not build it on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Aisha had surely heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka&#8217;ba was not built on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). (So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &#8216;Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &#8220;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.&#8221; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&#8217;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8220;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.&#8221; (2.143)</p>

So they (i.e. Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message. And the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah &#8220;Thus We have made of you a just and the best nation that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, and I was at that time a young boy, &#8220;How do you interpret the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj to the House of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.

When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, whereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158)</p>

The law of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in cases of murder: The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the relatives (or one of them) of the killed (person) forgive their brother (i.e. the killers something of Qisas (i.e. not to kill the killer by accepting blood money in the case of intentional murder)&#8212;-then the relatives (of the killed person) should demand blood-money in a reasonable manner and the killer must pay with handsome gratitude. This is an allevitation and a Mercy from your Lord, (in comparison to what was prescribed for the nations before you).</p>

Anas bin Al-Nadr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will the incisor tooth of Ar-Rubai be broken? No, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, her incisor tooth will not be broken.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Anas!

Islam is founded on five principles, i.e. believe in Allah and His Apostle, the five compulsory prayers, the fasting of the month of Ramadan, the payment of Zakat, and the Hajj to the House (of Allah).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! Won&#8217;t you listen to why Allah has mentioned in His Book: &#8216;If two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them, but if one of then transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then you all fight against the one that transgresses. (49.9) and:&#8211;&#8220;And fight them till there is no more affliction (i.e. no more worshiping of others along with Allah).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did it, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when Islam had only a few followers. A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is your opinion about &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Uthman, it seems that Allah has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Verse of Hajj-at-Tamatu was revealed in Allah&#8217;s Book, so we performed it with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and nothing was revealed in Qur&#8217;an to make it illegal, nor did the Prophet prohibit it till he died. But the man (who regarded it illegal) just expressed what his own mind suggested.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ukaz, Mijanna and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the Pre-islamic Period. They (i.e. Muslims) considered it a sin to trade there during the Hajj time (i.e. season), so this Verse was revealed:&#8211; &#8220;There is no harm for you if you seek of the Bounty of your Lord during the Hajj season.&#8221; (2.198)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people and those who embraced their religion, used to stay at Muzdalifa and used to call themselves Al-Hums, while the rest of the Arabs used to stay at &#8216;Arafat. When Islam came, Allah ordered His Prophet to go to &#8216;Arafat and stay at it, and then pass on from there, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah:&#8211;&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (2.199)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to &#8216;Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of &#8216;Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of &#8216;Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to &#8216;Arafat and stay there from the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from &#8216;Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam&#8217; (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8220;(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help &#8230;.&#8221; (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound &#8216;dh&#8217;, and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: &#8220;..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Allah&#8217;s Help? Yes, verily, Allah&#8217;s Help is near.&#8221; (2.214)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I met &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;Aisha said, &#8216;Allah forbid! By Allah, Allah never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars.&#8221; reading &#8216;Kudh-dhibu with double &#8216;dh.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Ibn &#8216;Umar recited the Qur&#8217;an, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur&#8217;an and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, &#8220;Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed? &#8221; I replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was revealed in such-and-such connection.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then resumed his recitation. Nafi added regarding the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;So go to your tilth when or how you will&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It means one should approach his wife in ..&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews used to say: &#8220;If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child.&#8221; So this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Your wives are a tilth unto you; so go to your tilth when or how you will.&#8221; (2.223)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister of Ma&#8217;qal bin Yasar was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of &#8216;Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal refused, so this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.&#8221; (2.232)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 53:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan (while he was collecting the Qur&#8217;an) regarding the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives &#8230;&#8221; (2.240) &#8220;This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur&#8217;an)?&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said. &#8220;O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 54:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse):&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They &#8211; (their wives) &#8212; shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).&#8221; (2.234)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband&#8217;s family, so Allah revealed: &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year&#8217;s maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.&#8217; (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband&#8217;s home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.&#8221; So the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata said: Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: &#8220;..without turning them out..&#8221; cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband&#8217;s house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217;s aid: If she wished, she could complete her &#8216;Idda by staying in her dead husband&#8217;s residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband&#8217;s house), so she could complete the &#8216;Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow&#8217;s) dwelling in her dead husband&#8217;s house and she could complete the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah&#8217;s Statement says:&#8211;&#8220;&#8230;without turning them out&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Utba regarding the question of Subai&#8217;a bint Al-Harith. Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;But &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s uncle used not to say so.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,&#8221; and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin &#8216;Amir or Malik bin &#8216;Auf, and said, &#8220;What was the verdict of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8216;Why do you impose on her the hard order and don&#8217;t let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara).&#8221; (i.e. Her &#8216;Idda is up till she delivers.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, &#8220;The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one Rak&#8217;a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak&#8217;a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a Rak&#8217;a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second Rak&#8217;a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not.&#8221; Nafi added: I do not think that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar narrated this except from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly &#8220;The Fear Prayer.&#8221;)</p>

While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, &#8216;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &#8216;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &#8216;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&#8217;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&#8217; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &#8216;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) family status amongst you? I said, &#8216;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&#8221; Heraclius said, &#8216;Was any of his ancestors a king?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&#8217; I said, &#8216;It is the poor who followed him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you fight with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;How was your fighting with him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did he ever betray?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &#8216;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &#8216;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&#8221; Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Heraclius then asked me, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&#8217; Then Heraclius said, &#8216;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&#8217; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine&#8230;&#8230;.. Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah&#8217;s Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah&#8217;s Statement):&#8211;&#8220;O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Allah&#8230;.bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8217; (3.64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;While coming out, I said to my companions, &#8216;The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.&#8217; So I continued to believe that Allah&#8217;s Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace Islam.&#8221; Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, &#8216;O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?&#8217; (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, &#8216;Bring them back to me.&#8217; So he called them and said, &#8216;I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.&#8217; Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Out of all the Ansar, living in Medina, Abu Talha had the largest number of (date palm trees) gardens, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was standing opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good water. When the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Allah says:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Allah&#8217;s Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Allah. So, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Allah orders you (to dispose it of).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives.&#8221; The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from among them who had committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We blacken their faces with coal and beat them,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We do not find anything in it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. &#8220;You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful.&#8221; (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar-Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher&#8217;s) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, &#8220;This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones.</p>

Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham, and &#8216;Aiyash bin Abu Rabi&#8217;a. O Allah! Inflict Your Severe Torture on Mudar (tribe) and strike them with (famine) years like the years of Joseph.&#8221; The Prophet used to say in a loud voice, and he also used to say in some of his Fajr prayers, &#8220;O Allah! Curse so-and-so and so-and-so.&#8221; naming some of the Arab tribes till Allah revealed:&#8211;&#8220;Not for you (O Muhammad) (but for Allah) is the decision.&#8221; (3.128)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 89:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, &#8220;O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, &#8220;Did you not hear what &#8216;Abu Hub-b said?&#8221; He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai. &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; On that Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Allah said: &#8220;And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans&#8230;&#8230;..'(3.186) And Allah also said:&#8211;&#8220;Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..&#8221; (2.109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).&#8221; So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, some men among the hypocrites used to remain behind him (i.e. did not accompany him) when he went out for a Ghazwa and they would be pleased to stay at home behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned (from the battle) they would put forward (false) excuses and take oaths, wishing to be praised for what they had not done. So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>

It was only that the Prophet called the Jews and asked them about something, and they hid the truth and told him something else, and showed him that they deserved praise for the favor of telling him the answer to his question, and they became happy with what they had concealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Abbas recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;(And remember) when Allah took a Covenant from those who were given the Scripture..and those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done.&#8217; &#8221; (3.187-188)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an orphan (girl) under the care of a man. He married her and she owned a date palm (garden). He married her just because of that and not because he loved her. So the Divine Verse came regarding his case: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls&#8230;&#8221; (4.3) The sub-narrator added: I think he (i.e. another sub-narrator) said, &#8220;That orphan girl was his partner in that datepalm (garden) and in his property.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked &#8216;Aisha regarding the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls&#8230;&#8221; (4.3) She said, &#8220;O son of my sister! An Orphan girl used to be under the care of a guardian with whom she shared property. Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Allah, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added,&#8221; The people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They ask your instruction regarding women &#8221; (4.127) &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And yet whom you desire to marry.&#8221; (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And whoever amongst the guardian is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his work). This Verse was revealed regarding the orphan&#8217;s property. If the guardian is poor, he can take from the property of the orphan, what is just and reasonable according to his work and the time he spends on managing it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said ( regarding the verse), &#8220;And when the relatives and the orphans and the poor are present at the time of division, &#8220;this verse and its order is valid and not abrogated.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and Abu Bakr came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama&#8217;s (dwellings). The Prophet found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?&#8221; So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah commands you as regards your children&#8217;s (inheritance):&#8221; (4.11)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Pre-Islamic Period ) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Allah cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Divine Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them.&#8221; (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Verse: &#8220;To everyone, We have appointed heirs.&#8221; (4.33) &#8216;Mawali&#8217; means heirs. And regarding:&#8211; &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter&#8217;s relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;To everyone We have appointed heirs.&#8221; was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn Abbas then said: &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221; is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, &#8220;Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.&#8221; Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.&#8217; They will be directed and addressed thus, &#8216;Will you drink,&#8217; whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, &#8216;What are you waiting for?&#8217; Every nation have followed what they used to worship.&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say twice or thrice, &#8216;We do not worship any besides Allah.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Irrigate (your lands and the let the water flow to your neighbor The Ansar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (This is because) he (Zubair) is your cousin?&#8221; At that, the Prophet&#8217;s face became red (with anger) and he said &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor.&#8221; So the Prophet enabled Az-Zubair to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: &#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.6)</p>

So the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people, stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said (to me), &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water, and they have no water with them.&#8221; So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say, and he hit me on my flanks with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain! but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water, so Allah revealed the Verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;It is not the first blessing of yours, O the family of Abu Bakr.&#8221; Then we made the camel on which I was riding, got up, and found the necklace under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A necklace of mine was lost at Al-Baida&#8217; and we were on our way to Medina. The Prophet made his camel kneel down and dismounted and laid his head on my lap and slept. Abu Bakr came to me and hit me violently on the chest and said, &#8220;You have detained the people because of a necklace.&#8221; I kept as motionless as a dead person because of the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ; (on my lap) although Abu Bakr had hurt me (with the slap). Then the Prophet woke up and it was the time for the morning (prayer). Water was sought, but in vain; so the following Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When you intend to offer prayer..&#8221; (5.6) Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;Allah has blessed the people for your sake, O the family of Abu Bakr. You are but a blessing for them.&#8221;</p>

So take them out and drink of their milk and urine.&#8217; So they took them and set out and drank of their urine and milk, and having recovered, they attacked the shepherd, killed him and drove away the camels.&#8217; Why should there be any delay in punishing them as they murdered (a person) and waged war against Allah and His Apostle and frightened Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; Anbasa said, &#8220;I testify the uniqueness of Allah!&#8221; Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Do you suspect me?&#8221; &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, Anas narrated that (Hadith) to us.&#8221; Then &#8216;Anbasa added, &#8220;O the people of such-and-such (country), you will remain in good state as long as Allah keeps this (man) and the like of this (man) amongst you.&#8221;</p>

Allah said to His Prophet: &#8220;Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; and leave (don&#8217;t punish) the foolish.&#8221; (7.199) and this (i.e. &#8216;Uyaina) is one of the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him; he observed (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And if two groups of believers fight against each other&#8230;&#8217; (49.9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what prevents you from fighting as Allah has mentioned in His Book?&#8221;&#8216; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! I would rather be blamed for not fighting because of this Verse than to be blamed because of another Verse where Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And whoever kills a believer intentionally&#8230;&#8221; (4.93) Then that man said, &#8220;Allah says:&#8211; &#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (worshipping other besides Allah) and the religion (i.e. worship) will be all for Allah (Alone)&#8221; (8.39) Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did this during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the number of Muslims was small, and a man was put to trial because of his religion, the pagans would either kill or chain him; but when the Muslims increased (and Islam spread), there was no persecution.&#8221; When that man saw that Ibn &#8216;Umar did not agree to his proposal, he said, &#8220;What is your opinion regarding &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Uthman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What is my opinion regarding Ali and &#8216;Uthman?

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;If there are twenty steadfast amongst you, they will overcome two hundred.&#8221; (8.65) was revealed, then it became obligatory for the Muslims that one (Muslim) should not flee from ten (non-Muslims). Sufyan (the sub-narrator) once said, &#8220;Twenty (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non Muslims).&#8221; Then there was revealed: &#8216;But now Allah has lightened your (task)..&#8217; (8.66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it became obligatory that one-hundred (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non-muslims). (Once Sufyan said extra, &#8220;The Verse: &#8216;Urge the believers to the fight. If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims) ..&#8217; was revealed.) Sufyan said, &#8220;Ibn Shabrama said, &#8220;I see that this order is applicable to the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil.&#8221;</p>

So (Allah) lightened the order by revealing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(But) now Allah has lightened your (task) for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are of you one-hundred steadfast, they will overcome (two-hundred (non-Muslims).&#8217; (8.66) So when Allah reduced the number of enemies which Muslims should withstand, their patience and perseverance against the enemy decreased as much as their task was lightened for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a disagreement between them (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubair) so I went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas in the morning and said (to him), &#8220;Do you want to fight against Ibn Zubair and thus make lawful what Allah has made unlawful (i.e. fighting in Meccas?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah forbid! Allah ordained that Ibn Zubair and Bani Umaiya would permit (fighting in Mecca), but by Allah, I will never regard it as permissible.&#8221; Ibn Abbas added. &#8220;The people asked me to take the oath of allegiance to Ibn AzZubair. I said, &#8216;He is really entitled to assume authority for his father, Az-Zubair was the helper of the Prophet, his (maternal) grandfather, Abu Bakr was (the Prophet&#8217;s) companion in the cave, his mother, Asma&#8217; was &#8216;Dhatun-Nitaq&#8217;, his aunt, &#8216;Aisha was the mother of the Believers, his paternal aunt, Khadija was the wife of the Prophet , and the paternal aunt of the Prophet was his grandmother. He himself is pious and chaste in Islam, well versed in the Knowledge of the Quran. By Allah!

So I said, &#8220;I never expected that he would refuse my offer to support him, and I don&#8217;t think he intends to do me any good, therefore, if my cousins should inevitably be my rulers, it will be better for me to be ruled by them than by some others.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Musaiyab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu Talib&#8217;s death approached, the Prophet went to him while Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, so that I may argue for your case with it before Allah.&#8221; On that, Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce &#8216;Abdul Muttalib&#8217;s religion?&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I will keep on asking (Allah for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.&#8217; (9.113)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 199:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat-al&#8217;Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. &#8220;I decided to tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah&#8217;s Apostle might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third of the night while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;O Um Salama! Ka&#8217;b has been forgiven!&#8217; She said, &#8216;Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.&#8217; So when the Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah said: &#8216;They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions.&#8221; (9.94)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone whom Allah has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Allah revealed to His Apostle: &#8220;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra&#8217; were killed). &#8216;Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra&#8217; (those who know the Qur&#8217;an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;How can I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not done?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said (to me), &#8216;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&#8217; So &#8216;Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as &#8216;Umar.&#8221; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &#8220;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur&#8217;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &#8221; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&#8217;an. I said to both of them, &#8220;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&#8221; (9.128)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some (cooked) meat was brought to Allah Apostle and the meat of a forearm was presented to him as he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, &#8220;I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Allah will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people will say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see to what state you have reached? Won&#8217;t you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord&#8217; Some people will say to some others, &#8216;Go to Adam.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say to him. &#8216;You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are? Don&#8217;t you see what condition we have reached?&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.&#8217; So they will go to Noah and say (to him), &#8216;O Noah! You are the first (of Allah&#8217;s Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Allah has named you a thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; He will say.&#8217; Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.&#8217; They will go to Abraham and say, &#8216;O Abraham! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; He will say to them, &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter.

Go to someone else; go to Moses.&#8217; The people will then go to Moses and say, &#8216;O Moses! You art Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah gave you superiority above the others with this message and with His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for us with your Lord Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; Moses will say, &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will become thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.&#8217; So they will go to Jesus and say, &#8216;O Jesus! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; Jesus will say. &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, &#8216;Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.&#8217; So they will come to me and say, &#8216;O Muhammad ! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then I will go beneath Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and Say, &#8216;My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord&#8217;. It will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The enemy of Allah (Nauf) told a lie.&#8221; Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Moses got up to deliver a speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah alone. So Allah revealed to him: &#8216;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;O my Lord, how can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.&#8217; So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant &#8216;Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,&#8217; &#8216;Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.&#8217; (18.63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, &#8216;That is what we have been seeking&#8217;. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. &#8216;Is there such a greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.&#8217; (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. &#8216;If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.&#8217; These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.&#8217; (18.71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me ?&#8217; (18.72) Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)&#8221; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.&#8217; Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.&#8217; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, &#8216;If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.&#8217; (18.76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, &#8216;These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217; (18.78-82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their story.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &#8216;Abbas, Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Ask me (any question)&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&#8217;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&#8221; As for &#8216;Amr, he said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&#8221; But Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Once Moses, Allah&#8217;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &#8216;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! Where is he?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;At the junction of the two seas.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Amr said to me, Allah said, &#8220;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&#8221; Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Allah said (to Moses), &#8216;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&#8217; &#8221; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&#8221; He said (to Moses).&#8221; You have not demanded too much.&#8221; And that is as mentioned by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant &#8230;. &#8216; (18.60) Yusha&#8217; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &#8220;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &#8220;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &#8216;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &#8220;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&#8221; Moses said &#8220;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&#8221; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &#8216;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&#8217; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &#8216;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&#8217; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &#8216;The pious slave of Allah.&#8217; (We said to Said &#8220;Was that Khadir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;) The boat men said, &#8216;We will not get him on board with fare.&#8217; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &#8216;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &#8220;Moses said so protestingly.&#8221;) Al-Khadir said, didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&#8217; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&#8217;la- said: Said said &#8216;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&#8217; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &#8216;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&#8217;la said, &#8216;I think Said said, &#8216;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &#8216;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &#8216;Wages that we might had eaten.&#8217; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&#8221; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8216;In front of them (was) a king.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &#8216;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &#8216;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&#8217; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &#8216;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&#8217; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&#8217; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&#8217;? (18.74). &#8216;Near to mercy&#8221; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&#8217;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &#8216;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf-al-Bakali &#8221; claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, &#8216;Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:&#8211; &#8216;Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! How can meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than &#8216;Amr said) &#8216;At the rock there was a water spring called &#8216;Al-Hayat&#8217; and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, &#8216;Bring our early meal&#8217; (18.62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish &#8230;&#8217; (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there any such greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man said, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and added, &#8216;may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?&#8217; (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, &#8216;O Moses! You have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;But I will follow you.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation&#8217;s knowledge compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow&#8217;s beak.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir&#8217;s action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, &#8216;These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have&#8230;&#8217; (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! &#8216; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.&#8217; (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, &#8216;When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217;&#8230;(18.78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their story.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to recite:&#8211; &#8216;And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) &#8230;and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. &#8220;</p>

Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed regarding you and your wife&#8217;s case in the Qur&#8217;an &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula&#8217;ana according to what Allah had mentioned in His Book. So &#8216;Uwaimir did Mula&#8217;ana with her and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I kept her I would oppress her.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;Look! If she (Uwaimir&#8217;s wife) delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that &#8216;Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will consider that &#8216;Uwaimir has told a lie against her.&#8221; Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned as a proof for &#8216;Uwaimir&#8217;s claim; therefore the child was ascribed to its mother henceforth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him whereupon you might kill him (i.e. the killer) (in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; So Allah revealed concerning their case what is mentioned of the order of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the man, &#8220;The matter between you and your wife has been decided.&#8221; So they did Mula&#8217;ana in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, and then the man divorced his wife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, so the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of his mother, and she would inherit of him what Allah prescribed for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma&#8217; and filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), &#8220;Either you bring forth a proof (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying, &#8220;Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal then said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment.&#8221; Then Gabriel came down and revealed to him:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;As for those who accuse their wives&#8230;&#8217; (24.6-9) The Prophet recited it till he reached: &#8216;&#8230; (her accuser) is telling the truth.&#8217; Then the Prophet left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and brought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet was saying, &#8220;Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?&#8221; Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, &#8220;It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Allah&#8217;s curse on you (if you are guilty).&#8221; So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, &#8220;I will not dishonor my family all through these days,&#8221; and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet then said, &#8220;Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma&#8217;s child.&#8221; Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet said, &#8220;If the case was not settled by Allah&#8217;s Law, I would punish her severely.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man accused his wife of illegal sexual intercourse and denied his paternity to her (conceived) child during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&#8217;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&#8217;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; and then depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined ! &#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8220;O you there! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he has said?&#8221; I said, &#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8221; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8220;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&#8221; But &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: So Allah&#8217;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &#8220;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &#8220;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&#8221; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&#8221; On that, Sad bin &#8216;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &#8220;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&#8221; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8220;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&#8221; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &#8220;Thereafter, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then I said to my mother, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&#8217;s father: &#8220;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &#8220;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&#8221; My mother said to me, &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not&#8230;.&#8221; (24.11-20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter&#8217;s kinship to him and his poverty, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha&#8221;. So Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&#8217;s Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.&#8221; Aisha further said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, &#8220;O Zainab! What have you seen?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&#8221; Of all the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&#8221; Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off&#8221; Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh), &#8220;You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.&#8221; It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, &#8220;Let Mistah. be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;O mother Why do you abuse your Son&#8221; On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Why do you abuse your son?&#8221; She stumbled for the third time and said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not abuse him except because of you.&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Concerning what of my affairs?&#8221; So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, &#8220;Has this really happened?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Send me to my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, &#8220;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&#8221; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&#8221; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &#8220;Does my father know about it?&#8221; She said, &#8220;yes&#8221; I asked, Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle know about it too?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, Allah&#8217;s Apostle does too.&#8221; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &#8220;What is the matter with her? &#8221; She said, &#8220;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&#8221; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&#8221; I went back to my home and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&#8221; On that, some of the Prophet&#8217;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &#8220;Tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.&#8221; Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&#8221; Later that man was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, &#8220;Now then O &#8216;Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&#8221; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&#8217;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&#8221; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &#8220;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &#8216;She has confessed herself guilty.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&#8217;s name but couldn&#8217;t) Joseph&#8217;s father when he said; So (for me) &#8220;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &#8220;Have the good tidings O &#8216; &#8220;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&#8221; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&#8221; (Aisha used to say:) &#8220;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&#8217;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) &#8230;Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.&#8221; So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</p>

O Bani &#8216;Adi!&#8221; addressing various tribes of Quraish till they were assembled. Those who could not come themselves, sent their messengers to see what was there. Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet then said, &#8220;Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) &#8220;May your hands perish all this day. Is it for this purpose you have gathered us?&#8221; Then it was revealed: &#8220;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab (one of the Prophet&#8217;s uncles), and perish he!

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, a sentence with which I will defend you before Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said to Abu Talib, &#8220;Will you now leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting him to say that sentence while the other two kept on repeating their sentence before him till Abu Talib said as the last thing he said to them, &#8220;I am on the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib,&#8221; and refused to say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Allah, I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans.&#8217; (9.113) And then Allah revealed especially about Abu Talib:&#8211;&#8216;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, &#8220;Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.&#8221; That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas&#8217;ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, &#8220;He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, &#8216;Allah knows best,&#8217; for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)&#8217; (38.86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.&#8217; So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).&#8217; Then Ibn Mas&#8217;ud recited:&#8211; &#8216;Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;.but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them thus): &#8216;On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah&#8217;s saying- &#8220;Lizama&#8221; (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious,&#8217; (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the defeat of Byzantine has already passed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came to him walking and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. What is Belief?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Belief is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the Resurrection.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Islam?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Islam is to worship Allah and not worship anything besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The man again asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or Benevolence)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take it for granted that) Allah sees you.&#8221; The man further asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle When will the Hour be established?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet replied, &#8220;The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.&#8221; (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, &#8220;Call him back to me.&#8221; They went to call him back but could not see him. The Prophet said, &#8220;That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 47 Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) when Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ordered to give option to his wives, he started with me, saying, &#8220;I am going to mention to you something, but you shall not hasten (to give your reply) unless you consult your parents.&#8221; The Prophet knew that my parents would not order me to leave him. Then he said, &#8220;Allah says: &#8216;O Prophet (Muhammad)! Say to your wives: If you desire the life of this world and its glitter&#8230;&#8230;..a great reward.&#8221; (33.28-29) I said, &#8220;Then why I consult my parents? Verily, I seek Allah, His Apostle and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8221; Then all the other wives of the Prophet did the same as I did.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to look down upon those ladies who had given themselves to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I used to say, &#8220;Can a lady give herself (to a man)?&#8221; But when Allah revealed: &#8220;You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive any of them whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily).&#8217; (33.51) I said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives) and you may receive any (of them) whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily). (33.51) I asked Aisha, &#8220;What did you use to say (in this case)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I used to say to him, &#8220;If I could deny you the permission (to go to your other wives) I would not allow your favor to be bestowed on any other person.&#8221;</p>

Then the Prophet (showed them) as if he is ready to get up, yet they did not get up. When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet&#8230;&#8217; (33.53)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I of all the people know best this verse of Al-Hijab. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh she was with him in the house and he prepared a meal and invited the people (to it). They sat down (after finishing their meal) and started chatting. So the Prophet went out and then returned several times while they were still sitting and talking. So Allah revealed the Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses until leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation &#8230;..ask them from behind a screen.&#8217; (33.53) So the screen was set up and the people went away.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A banquet of bread and meat was held on the occasion of the marriage of the Prophet to Zainab bint Jahsh. I was sent to invite the people (to the banquet), and so the people started coming (in groups); They would eat and then leave. Another batch would come, eat and leave. So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Carry away the remaining food.&#8221; Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you, O the people of the house!&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you. Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him. Then the Prophet returned and found a group of three persons still in the house chatting. The Prophet was a very shy person, so he went out (for the second time) and went towards the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha. I do not remember whether I informed him that the people have gone away. So he returned and as soon as he entered the gate, he drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.</p>

Then he went out to the dwelling places of the mothers of the believers (his wives), as he used to do in the morning of his marriage. He would greet them and invoke good on them, and they (too) would return his greeting and invoke good on him. When he returned to his house, he found two men talking to each other; and when he saw them, he went out of his house again. When those two men saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle: going out of his house, they quickly got up (and departed). I do not remember whether I informed him of their departure, or he was informed (by somebody else). So he returned, and when he entered the house, he lowered the curtain between me and him.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &#8220;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and &#8216;Umar said to me so-and-so.&#8221; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &#8220;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aflah, the brother of Abi Al-Quais, asked permission to visit me after the order of Al-Hijab was revealed. I said, &#8220;I will not permit him unless I take permission of the Prophet about him for it was not the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais but the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais that nursed me.&#8221; The Prophet entered upon me, and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais had nursed me.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, for he is your uncle. Taribat Yaminuki (may your right hand be saved)&#8221; &#8216;Urwa, the sub-narrator added: For that &#8216;Aisha used to say, &#8220;Consider those things which are illegal because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding foster relations.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe Be not like those who annoyed Moses, but Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was honorable in Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8217; (33.69)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &#8220;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&#8221; (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other.&#8221; (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?&#8217; So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&#8221;</p>

Those are they whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.&#8217; (6.90) So David was the one of those prophets whom Prophet (Muhammad) was ordered to follow.

I intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque till the morning so that all of you could see him, but then I remembered the Statement of my brother Solomon:&#8211;&#8216;My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) The narrator added: Then he (the Prophet) dismissed him, rejected. &#8216;Nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud and he said &#8220;O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, &#8220;Allah knows better,&#8217; for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to His Prophet: &#8216;Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Quran) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.&#8221; So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.&#8217; (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) &#8220;Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers.&#8221; How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: &#8216;One taught (by a human being), a madman?&#8217; &#8216;We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr.

Then He will say, &#8216;I am the King.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi.

<p style="text-align:justify;">There gathered near the House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba) two Quraishi persons and a person from Thaqif (or two persons from Thaqif and one from Quraish), and all of them with very fat bellies but very little intelligence. One of them said, &#8220;Do you think that Allah hears what we say?&#8221; Another said, &#8220;He hears us when we talk in a loud voice, but He doesn&#8217;t hear us when we talk in a low tone.&#8221; The third said, &#8220;If He can hear when we talk in a loud tone, then He can also hear when we speak in a low tone.&#8221; Then Allah, the Honorable, the Majestic revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And you have not been screening against yourself lest your ears, and eyes and your skins should testify against you&#8230;.&#8217; (41.22-23)</p>

There was no branch of the tribe of Quraish but the Prophet had relatives therein.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five things have passed, i.e. the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, Al-Batsha (the defeat of the infidels in the battle of Badr) and Al-Lizam (the punishment)&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 346:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Allah to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of torment.&#8217; (44.10-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they are on the verge of destruction.&#8221; On that the Prophet said (astonishingly) &#8220;Shall I invoke Allah) for the tribes of Mudar? Verily, you are a brave man!&#8221; But the Prophet prayed for rain and it rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;But truly you will return (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.15) (When the famine was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.16) The narrator said, &#8220;That was the day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 347:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of having knowledge that, when you do not know something, you say: &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to his Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist)&#8217; (38.86) When the Quraish troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph.&#8221; So they were stricken with a year of famine during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Allah), &#8220;If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism).&#8221; So the Prophet invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah&#8217;s Statement indicates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;we will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.10).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I came upon &#8216;Abdullah and he said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited Quraish (to Islam), they disbelieved him and stood against him. So he (the Prophet) said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years of Joseph.&#8217; So they were stricken with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they started eating dead animals, and if one of them got up he would see something like smoke between him and the sky from the severe fatigue and hunger.&#8221; Abdullah then recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. This is a painful torment&#8230; (till he reached) &#8230;&#8230;.. We shall indeed remove the punishment for a while, but truly you will revert (to heathenism): (44.10-15) &#8216;Abdullah added: &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He added,&#8221; The severe grasp&#8221; was the Day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah sent (the Prophet) Muhammad and said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say, No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an) nor am I one of the pretenders (i.e. a person who pretends things which do not exist). (38.68) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw Quraish standing against him, he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years (of famine) of Joseph. So they were afflicted with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they ate bones and hides. (One of them said), &#8220;And they ate hides and dead animals, and (it seemed to them that) something like smoke was coming out of the earth. So Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Your people are on the verge of destruction! Please invoke Allah to relieve them.&#8221; So the Prophet invoked Allah for them (and the famine disappeared). He said to them. &#8220;You will revert (to heathenism) after that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;&#8230;.but truly you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; He added, &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them in the Hereafter? The smoke and the grasp and the Al-Lizam have all passed.&#8221; One of the sub-narrater said, &#8220;The splitting of the moon.&#8221; And another said, &#8220;The defeat of the Romans (has passed).&#8221;</p>

And whenever he saw clouds or winds, signs of deep concern would appear on his face. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! When people see clouds they usually feel happy, hoping that it would rain, while I see that when you see clouds, one could notice signs of dissatisfaction on your face.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! What is the guarantee for me that there will be no punishment in it, since some people were punished with a wind? Verily, some people saw (received) the punishment, but (while seeing the cloud) they said, &#8216;This cloud will give us rain.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Allah). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets. You do not return evil for evil, but excuse and forgive.

On that Abu Wail said, &#8220;We were at Siffin (a city on the bank of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between &#8216;Ali and Muawiya) A man said, &#8220;Will you be on the side of those who are called to consult Allah&#8217;s Book (to settle the dispute)?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the Qur&#8217;an).&#8221; &#8216; Some people objected to &#8216;Ali&#8217;s agreement and wanted to fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, &#8216;Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time &#8216;Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won&#8217;t our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.&#8221; So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab!

One of the two recommended Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas, the brother of Bani Mujashi (to be their governor) while the other recommended somebody else. (Nafi&#8217;, the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.&#8217; (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;Since the revelation of this Verse, &#8216;Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet had to ask him to repeat his statements.&#8221; But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr).</p>

The man said to Thabit, &#8221; &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8221; Thabit replied that it was an evil affair, for he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds had been annulled, and he considered himself as one of the people of the Fire. Then the man returned to the Prophet and told him that Thabit had said, so-and-so. (Musa bin Anas) said: The man returned to Thabit with great glad tidings. The Prophet said to the man. &#8220;Go back to him and say to him: &#8220;You are not from the people of the Hell Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221;</p>

So, to compensate for not having blood relation with them.&#8217; I intended to do them some favor so that they might protect my relatives (at Mecca), and I did not do this out of disbelief or an inclination to desert my religion.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to his companions), &#8220;He (Hatib) has told you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off?&#8221; The Apostle said, &#8220;He is one of those who witnessed (fought in) the Battle of Badr, and what do you know, perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr (Badr warriors) and said, &#8216;Do what you want as I have forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; (Amr, a sub-narrator, said,: This Verse was revealed about him (Hatib):</p>

When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance to you&#8230; Verily! Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8217; (60.12) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;And if any of the believing women accepted the condition (assigned in the above-mentioned Verse), Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her. &#8220;I have accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8221; &#8220;He would only say that, for, by Allah, his hand never touched, any lady during that pledge of allegiance.

Thereupon a lady withdrew her hand (refrained from taking the oath of allegiance), and said, &#8220;But such-and-such lady lamented over one of my relatives, so I must reward (do the same over the dead relatives of) hers.&#8221; The Prophet did not object to that, so she went (there) and returned to the Prophet so he accepted her pledge of allegiance.</p>

Once the Prophet (after completing the prayer and the sermon) came down, as if I am now looking at him waving at the men with his hand to sit down, and walked through them till he, along with Bilal, reached (the rows of) the women.

When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance that they will not worship anything other than Allah, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, will not kill their children, and will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (by making illegal children belonging to their husbands)&#8217;&#8230;.(60.12) Having finished, he said, &#8216;Do you agree to that?&#8221; One lady, other than whom none replied the Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; (The, sub-narrator, Al-Hasan did not know who the lady was.)

<p style="text-align:justify;">For the whole year I had the desire to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They were Hafsa and &#8216;Aisha.&#8221; Then I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you.&#8221; Then Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, &#8220;I recommend that you do so-and-so.&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?&#8221; She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don&#8217;t want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!&#8221; &#8216;Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;O my daughter! Do you argue with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?&#8221; H. afsa said, &#8220;By Allah, we argue with him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Know that I warn you of Allah&#8217;s punishment and the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . . O my daughter! Don&#8217;t be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for her (i.e. &#8216;Aisha).&#8221; &#8216;Umar addled, &#8220;Then I went out to Um Salama&#8217;s house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives!&#8217; By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, &#8220;Open Open!&#8217; I said, &#8216;Has the king of Ghassan come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but something worse; Allah&#8217;s Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let the nose of &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!&#8217; Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, &#8216;Say (to the Prophet ) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.&#8217; Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.&#8217; &#8216;Why are you weeping?&#8217; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah&#8217;s Apostle though you are, is living in destitute&#8221;. The Prophet then replied. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I intended to ask &#8216;Umar about those two ladies who back each other against &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle . For one year I was seeking the opportunity to ask this question, but in vain, until once when I accompanied him for Hajj. While we were in Zahran, &#8216;Umar went to answer the call of nature and told me to follow him with some water for ablution. So I followed him with a container of water and started pouring water for him. I found it a good opportunity to ask him, so I said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were those two ladies who had backed each other (against the Prophet)?&#8221; Before I could complete my question, he replied, &#8220;They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out along with a group of his companions towards &#8216;Ukaz Market. At that time something intervened between the devils and the news of the Heaven, and flames were sent down upon them, so the devils returned. Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? &#8221; They said, &#8220;Something has intervened between us and the news of the Heaven, and fires (flames) have been shot at us.&#8221; Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;Nothing has intervened between you and the news of the Heaven, but an important event has happened. Therefore, travel all over the world, east and west, and try to find out what has happened.&#8221; And so they set out and travelled all over the world, east and west, looking for that thing which intervened between them and the news of the Heaven. Those of the devils who had set out towards Tihama, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at Nakhla (a place between Mecca and Taif) while he was on his way to Ukaz Market. (They met him) while he was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Holy Qur&#8217;an being recited (by Allah&#8217;s Apostle), they listened to it and said (to each other). This is the thing which has intervened between you and the news of the Heavens.&#8221; Then they returned to their people and said, &#8220;O our people! We have really heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an). It gives guidance to the right, and we have believed therein. We shall not join in worship, anybody with our Lord.&#8221; (See 72.1-2) Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (Surat al-Jinn):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: It has been revealed to me that a group (3 to 9) of Jinns listened (to the Qur&#8217;an).&#8217; (72.1) The statement of the Jinns was revealed to him .</p>

He replied &#8220;O you, wrapped-up (i.e. Al Muddaththir).&#8221; I said, &#8220;They say it was, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who created,&#8217; (i.e. Surat Al-&#8216;Alaq (the Clot).&#8221; On that, Abu Salama said, &#8220;I asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah about that, saying the same as you have said, whereupon he said, &#8216;I will not tell you except what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was in seclusion in the cave of Hiram&#8217;, and after I completed the limited period of my seclusion. I came down (from the cave) and heard a voice calling me. I looked to my right, but saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw something. So I went to Khadija (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) and told her to wrap me up and pour cold water on me. So they wrapped me up and poured cold water on me.&#8221; Then, &#8216;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped up! Arise and warn,&#8217; (Surat Al Muddaththir) was revealed.&#8221; (74.1)</p>

I looked up, and behold ! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the cave of Hira&#8217; sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was too much afraid of him (so I returned to my house) and said, &#8216;Fold me up in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me up. Then Allah revealed: &#8216;O you wrapped&#8230;and desert the idols before the prayer became compulsory.&#8217; Rujz means idols.</p>

I looked up towards the sky, and behold! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the Cave of Hira&#8217;, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was so terrified by him that I fell down on the ground. Then I went to my wife and said, &#8216;Wrap me in garments! Wrap me in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me, and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn&#8230;and desert the idols.&#8221; (74.1-5) Abu Salama said&#8230;.Rujz means idols.&#8221; After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to move his tongue when the divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. (Sufyan, a subnarrator, demonstrated (how the Prophet used to move his lips) and added. &#8220;In order to memorize it.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 450:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Musa bin Abi Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked Said bin Jubair regarding (the statement of Allah). &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that the Prophet used to move his lips when the Divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. So the Prophet was ordered not to move his tongue, which he used to do, lest some words should escape his memory. &#8216;It is for Us to collect it&#8217; means, We will collect it in your chest;&#8217; and its recitation&#8217; means, We will make you recite it. &#8216;But when We recite it (i.e. when it is revealed to you), follow its recital; it is for Us to explain it and make it clear,&#8217; (i.e. We will explain it through your tongue).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Allah&#8217;s Apostle , he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Allah revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection&#8230;&#8217; (75) the Verses:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Quran) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn Abbas added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur&#8217;an) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, &#8220;When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it,&#8221; means, &#8216;It is for us to explain it through your tongue.&#8217; So whenever Gabriel came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216; he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Allah promised him.</p>

He then said, &#8220;There is none among you, and no created soul but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire, and also has his happy or miserable fate (in the Hereafter) written for him.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we depend upon what is written for us and give up doing (good) deeds? For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery.&#8221; Then he recited: &#8216;As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.&#8217; (92.5-10)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, &#8220;Cover me!&#8221; They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, &#8220;O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me.&#8221; Then he told her the story. Khadija said, &#8220;Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities.&#8221; Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija&#8217;s paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say.&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young.&#8221; He added some other statement. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Will these people drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly.&#8221; But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was very much grieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. &#8220;Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.&#8217; He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!&#8221; So they covered him and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salama said, &#8220;(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship.&#8221; After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A man may keep them (for Allah&#8217;s Cause) to receive a reward in the Hereafter; another may keep them as a means of protection; and a third may keep them to be a burden for him. As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Allah&#8217;s Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a source of) reward for such a man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause, then that horse will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.&#8217; (99.7-8)</p>
