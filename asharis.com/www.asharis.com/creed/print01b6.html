<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
In all the various discussions that take place, in person, on blogs, forums and the likes, one of the greatest slanders made against Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah by today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> [posing as <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and slandering the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah) by doing so] is that they - by implication - accuse the entirety of the Salaf, and likewise the forerunners of the early <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, al-Muhaasibee, al-Qalaanisee, and likewise, the early <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself, <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, as being <u><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></u>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>There will probably be voices of disgust and uproar at such a suggestion, but as we will demonstrate, this is indeed the case, as much as it tries to be hidden and shoved under the carpet. The reality is that most people who aspire to be "Ash'aris" are merely mental playthings for their academic leaders who are perpetrating a great swindle. This swindle should become clear as we progress through this series inshaa'Allaah, and we advise the aspiring "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" to have a sense of shame and honour, and not let himself be intellecually and academically abused any more on account of his own ignorance.</div>    <P>
Because this slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> is grave, then it is important to aid one's Muslim brother, be he the oppressed or the one oppressing, and so the intent is to aid those poor souls against their souls and save them from having to meet Allaah whilst having slandered a multitude of Sunnis (Atharis, Salafis, all synonymous terms) with the accusation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>, based upon either <b>a)</b> <u>pure taqlid</u> of their guides (like Keller, Yusuf, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, Kawthari and others who conceal the truth, perhaps deliberately), or <b>b)</b><u> corrupted intellects</u> through which they are deluded into thinking they understand their doctrinal school [most of them are deluded and actually grasp very little of the issues as is plainly evident from a survey of their polemics over years]. They don't even grasp the sayings of those whom they ascribe to whether that be <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a>  (d. 429H), or Abu Bakr <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), or even Imam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (d. 321H). So inshaa'Allaah, in this series of articles, we aim to lift that fog from their eyes and aid them against their oppressive souls.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Separating and Not Generalizing</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As many of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah have pointed out in the past, that from the greatest crimes in knowledge <u>is to generalize, when one should make distinction</u>, and that the failure to do this brings such corruption in knowledge based matters, that it is behind most if not all deviation. And this is actually the problem of today's pseudo-Ash'aris [those who remain deluded into thinking they are following the specific creed of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, when they have very little, if not zero connection to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, even <u>if we assume</u> he remained a Kullaabi]. So it is obligatory to separate out the various factions, because a lot of the statements of the Scholars amongst the Salaf and the Khalaf were made in <u>certain contexts</u> and applied to <u>very specific positions</u> held by <u>specific factions</u>. The failure to distinguish between them means that you are possibly subjecting yourself to entry into Hellfire for accusing another Muslim of that which He is free of (i.e. of tajseem), and this is accusing the average Muslim, let alone the Scholar from Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Athar!</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Various Factions</font>    <P>
We can divide the factions into two groups:     <P>
<blockquote><p><u><b>The first:</b></u> the followers of the revealed Books and sent Messengers who took the truth from these sources and considered them the manifest truth and firmly believed that Allah is the <u>most-knowledgeable</u> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) of His own self, the <u>most eloquent</u> in speech (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) and intended nothing but guidance, direction  to His creation through what He revealed. Likewise they firmly believe that the Messenger is the <u>most knowledgeable</u> of the creation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) regarding Allaah, the Most High, and <u>most eloquent</u> in speech in the creation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>)  and <u>most sincere</u> in intending good (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1606;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) for the Ummah). Upon this foundation they accepted whatever Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him in the manner that is outlined further below.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><p><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">These are the people who drank from the stream at its highest, purest, cleanest, most-refreshing, most-satisfying source. Their language was identical to that of Allaah and His Messenger, they were drinking pure and thus speaking pure, <u>what goes in is what comes out</u>. This drink does not intoxicate nor befog or leave unsatiated. These people did not consider the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as mere akhbaar (news, reports, information), rather they knew it contains the most powerful reason, rationale and argument too. These people are soundest in belief, in constitution of the mind, and clearest in thought, the most upright and moderate in speech and opinion - so may your mother be bereaved of you if you knew this and then turned on your heels and went to other than them, who are:</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote><p><u><b>The second:</b></u> The followers of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies) taken from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers which forced them to incorporate innovated language into describing their Lord. As a result they concurred with the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, and the Hellenized Jews and Hellenized Christians (see these five articles: <a href=index2670.html?kagzi>Part 1</a>,  <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>Part 2</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>Part 3</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>Part 4</a>, <a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>Part 5</a>) in the language of how they described Allaah, even if they vehemently opposed some of these factions in other affairs [such as the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, in the issues of creation, eternity of the universe, resurrection, prophethood, revelation and the likes]. These are the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> who were condemnded by <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik, Shafi'i, Ahmad and the entirety of the Salaf, and this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> was the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of al-ajsaam (bodies) and al-a'raad (incidental attributes) - not the genus of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, not what is otherwise referred to as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in the sense of defending the truth with the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and sound, uncorrupted reason. As for the condemned <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> it is the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> and its associated language.    <P>
</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><p><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">These are the people who think the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is mere akhbaar (reports, news, information) and does not contain inherent rationale and reason that can be depended upon, spoken with, and implemented in debate, and they think this would be circular reasoning. Thus they went to drink from the stream much lower down, after it has been polluted with the <u>blood</u>, <u>puss</u> and <u>dung</u> [figuratively speaking] of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, Hellenized Jews, Hellenized Christians, and the Sabean star and idol-worshippers [<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>read this series</a>]. Anyone who drank from this was condemned by the Salaf and warned against. This was the condemned <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> in the view of the Salaf, the speech of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> (bodies and incidental attributes). Those who drank from this polluted water began saying [through both the tongue of disposition and the tongue of flesh] that the speech from He who is <i>a'lam</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) and <i>afsah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) (Allaah)  and the speech of he who is <i>a'lam</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) and <i>afsah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) and <i>ansah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1606;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) in the creation (the Messenger) contains - [if left as it is in the language of those to whom it was sent upon what they would have ordinarily understood from it] - that which is utter misguidance and kufr, that is, <u>tashbih, tajsim</u> and that it was meant only for <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>the dumb commoners</a> who were too dumb to understand the real truth, and Allaah and His Messenger were forced to used that language so as not to turn to the majority to <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a>. So whilst Allaah and His Messenger instilled faith in the majority through the language of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih, it was supposedly left to these Mutakallimin to now present <u>the real Tawhid</u>, to complete what Allaah and His Messenger never completed (and how could they when the Arabic language is supposedly deficient and the majority of the audience is supposedly too dumb to understand the real truth). So it was supposedly left to these people then to establish the true and real <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> upon what they had inherited of the refuse of previous nations, which originated from a star and idol-worshipping pagan disbeliever, his language, terminology and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. Hence, <u>the real truth</u> is in the sayings, language and terminology of those and not in the language of Allaah and His Messenger. So when these people (the Mutakallimin) had drunk from this polluted water, they then began to "correct" Allaah and His Messenger and presented "the real and true language" that represents the "absolute truth", the true and real language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> which Allaah and His Messenger were unable to express, or chose not to express, which is the language of <u>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</u>, and the "negative theology" of the Greeks, Hindus, Hellenized Jews, Hellenized Christians, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and others, "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an 'arad</i>..." and so on. And from this you will understand that great statement of that great Shafi'ite Imaam,  Ibn Surayj (d. 306H) who said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi with his isnaad, in "<i>Dhamm ul-Kalaam</i>" and as mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<i><a href='tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a></i>":    <P>

<blockquote><p>The Tawheed of the people of knowledge and the jamaa'ah of the Muslims is "<i>I testify none is worthy of worship except Allaah (alone) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah</i>". And the Tawheed of the people of falsehood is disputing about <i>al-a'raad</i> (incidental attributes) and <i>al-ajsaam</i> (bodies) and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent with the rejection of that.</blockquote>    <P>
So the Prophet (alayhis salaam) was sent with what is pure, clean, wholesome, and to reject that which previous nations had been drinking from, from that which is tainted, mixed, impure, and which led them astray in speaking about their Lord. And you should know that these people (the Ahl al-Kalaam) are united with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> upon what we have just mentioned above, do not delude yourself and insult your own intelligence by denying this [just because you saw them fighting with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> on other issues], and if you choose to remain in cloud cuckoo, go and read these three articles and see if you can find any difference between the sayings of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> [d. 505H] (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>read it here</a>), <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> [d.606H] (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz >read it here</a>) and that Kafir, Ibn Sinaa [d. 429H] (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>read it here</a>), who they followed in this matter after getting diseased by reading his books such as <i>al-Shifaa</i> and <i>al-Ishaaraat</i>.     <P>
Then when you have verified that what we have said is indeed the truth and this is indeed the very evil perception of these people [whether it is expressed, implied, hinted at, or concealed], then just choose and decide if you want drink from the stream contaminated with puss, urine, faeces, or from the stream of purity and innocence. And we petition you not to insult your intelligence a second time and start confusing between that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> the Salaf condemned which leads to this evil perception towards Allaah and His Messenger, and between that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is simply establishing the truth by reliance upon the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Hadith and sound uncorrupted reason. The <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> that the Salaf condemned (al-ajsaam wal-a'raad) is not sound uncorrupted reason, it is the refuse of previous Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) originating in the language and philosophy of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, about which al-Shafi'ee (d. 204H) said, as reported by as-Suyuti in Sawn al-Mantiq (1/47-48):    <P>

It is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of jawaahir (substances) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (their incidental attributes) which all of the Mutakallimin founded their theology upon.</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
So we can look at each of these two groups and their views:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>From the People of the Sunnah, Hadith Who <u>Did Not</u> Delve Into The Heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (Huduth al-Ajsaam and Its Binding Necessities), Meaning They Drunk From the Stream At Its Higher, Purer Source.</font>    <P>
We can divide these into <u>three</u> groups:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b><u>The First:</b> The Righteous Salaf</u> from the Companions, the Tabi'een, the Imaams of the second and third centuries, like al-Awzaa'ee, al-Thawri, <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Maalik, Shafi'i, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Ahmad bin Hanbal and others. They are affirmed everything Allaah affirmed for Himself of names, attributes and actions -  upon their meanings - whilst negating any likeness between Allaah, in His essence, attributes and actions, with the realities found in the creation, and they said that everything Allaah described Himself with, there is no tasbhih in it at all, and so they spoke with it and left the knowledge of its  <u>kaifiyyah</u> and <u>haqiqah</u> with their Lord.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>They refuted <u>the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> group</u> which was represented by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the second century who denied Allaah's attributes, such as hearing, seeing, power, wish, and likewise face, hands, and likewise <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, nuzul, pleasure, anger, love and the likes. The Salaf refuted them and made no distinction between names, attributes and actions and treated the entirety of it all with a single uniform principle, which is qubool (acceptance) taslim (submission) affirmation (<a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>) <u>upon their meanings</u>, whilst denying knowledge of the how (kayf) and without making tamthil and tashbih and remaining within the tahdid (definition) provided by the text itself (to properly grasp the usage of the words hadd and tahdid <a href=index291b.html?vxilx>please refer to this article</a>, as many do not really fathom this). </div>    <P>

<u><b>The Second:</u> Those Who Exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (Affirmation):</b> and this was through one of two ways:    <P>
<ol><li> Either by saying, "Power like my power, hearing like my hearing, seeing like my seeing, face like my face, hand like my hand" and so on. And this is attributed to Muqatil bin Sulayman (d. 150), the Mufassir. However, this is disputed by some because there does not exist any direct citation of any of his speech which necessitates <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (explanation of istawaa with istaqarra also comes from Ibn al-Mubaarak, al-Kalbi and Tha'lab) , and as for whatever criticism is cited about him, then that information was cited by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> through the route and direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and they accuse Ahl al-Sunnah of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> already, and that could involve lies and exaggerations. Further he was praised highly by certain authorities like Imaam al-Shaafi'ee in tafsir and criticism of him was in relation to hadeeth. So the reality of his affair needs investigation, since there is nothing of direct citations of his actual speech. Further, there are works of his which are present and published, al-Ashbaah wal-Nadhaa'ir and Tafsir Khamsami'at Aayaat, and there is nothing in there which suggests any <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and tasbeeh. There is affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (which to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> and Maturidis is <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and tashbeeh).    <P>
<li>Or by affirming fabricated narrations which contain repugnant things ascribed to Allaah and which may have been fabricated by the enemies of Islaam to corrupt the religion. From those who were attached to hadeeth who fell into some of this, such as <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> (d. 453H), the Hanbali scholar. On top of this he was also affected by the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, and he considered the validity of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (which is the foundation of the creed of Ahl al-Kalaam) as a result of which he had views on <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which was a deviation from what <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and the Salaf were upon.

So all of this is rejected from him, but it is important to understand the particular route he fell into what he fell into.</ol>    <P>
<b><u>The Third:</u> Those Who Never Drank From the Stream Lower Down But Either Kept Company With Those Did Or Adopted the Conclusions of Those Who Did Because They Lived in a Time When These People Were Dominant or Abdundant and They Acquired Knowledge Within that Setting.</b> This is a very important distinction to make here, and this includes the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar. We will comment on them further a bit later. But these Scholars did not drink from that impurity. They were attached to the hadeeth, <u>BUT</u> they considered the conclusions of those who had drunken from that impurity to be correct and valid, without having themselves drunk from it and engrossed themselves in it. Thus, you will not see in their books what you will find in the books of those who engrossed themselves into al-ajsaam wal-a'raad and huduth al-ajsaam and so on. However, when they considered the correctness of the conclusions, they then had to reconcile that with what they knew from the ahaadeeth. And thus we see them speaking with some of the language of the Mutakallimin, and speaking with something of either <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> or tafwid, <u>but not speaking with their usool (underlying foundations)</u>, rather we see them rebuking the Mutakallimin in those areas. For proof <a href=index8c76.html?ublmv >see this article</a> for example about <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar, where these scholars critize and rebuke the [Ash'arite] Mutakallimin for indulging in the language of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and speaking with the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (al-nadhar wal-istidlaal, the first obligation and the likes). And what goaded these scholars to consider the truth of those types of negations coming from the Mutakallimin, was that there were factions of <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (who are discussed below) like the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who wallowed in <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and takyif, and they were refuted in that regard by others from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Kullaabiyyah, Ash'ariyyah). So within this context, those later Scholars considered this language of the Mutakallim to be the truth, and so they reconciled it with their knowledge of hadeeth and thereby fell into something of <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid, wrongly thinking that this was the approach of the Salaf. And some of them were very frank in admitting in places that their view was other than the view of the Salaf. Take a read of these three articles from <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> as an illustration (see   <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>here</a>, <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>here</a> and <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>). Further, it was by virtue of their dedication to hadeeth that they identified and pointed out the errors of those Mutakallimin in some of their usool. So the point here is that these scholars never set out to drink from that stream lower down, rather they turned to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and hadeeth and were dedicated to it, but they took the opinion of those that did, considering their conclusions to be the truth, and thus were influenced in their language, and hence something of departure occurred from them from the way of the Salaf. Some of them clearly identified with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (like al-Nawawi) but others did not (like Ibn Hajar), and what is correct is that Ibn Hajar is not an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>. What is important though is that we understand that they did not delve into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in the sense that they studied it and built their theology upon it and the likes. They never came from this angle, but they did get affected by the conclusions of the Mutakallimin and their language.  </blockquote>    <P>

So let us discuss each of these and lift the veil by Allaah's permission...    <P>
<blockquote><p>  <b><u>The First:</u> al-Ja'd bin Dirham, <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (Heavy Mu'attilah)</b>. These appeared in <u>the early second century (after 100H)</u>, whilst the Taabi'een were alive. So these are the ones who took the leftovers of previous nations, the Hellenized Jews (an example of which is <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>), the Hellenized Christians (an example of which is <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>), the pseudo-Sabeans (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>), the refuse of these people, and so they drunk and drunk, and founded their deen upon huduth al-ajsaam, thinking by way of it they could establish a proof for the origination of the universe, but then they realized that in order to maintain that proof, they have to deny Allah's names, attributes and actions, since they argued that attributes and actions are proof of the createdness of things. And it is because of this that al-Ja'd and al-Jahm denied Allaah spoke to Moses direct (because it is an "event" and events only take place in bodies) and denied that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter (because vision can only be in a direction and this necessitates embodiment), and denied that Allaah took Ibrahim as a friend (because this is both an event and ascribing khullah, friendship, to Allaah, a deficiency), and the greatest affair to them was that Allaah is not above the creation, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, because direction implies place which implies embodiment, and their greatest desire was to eradicate this belief from the hearts of the Muslims, which Muslims hold out of both fitrah and revealed text, and because they (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah) considered it kufr and shirk, because it is the greatest of what clashed with their proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>. This is why the Salaf became wise to them and you would do real good <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>to read these ten or so statements</a> from the Salaf in the early second to third centuries. Likewise, following from their language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad and their proof of huduth al-ajsaam, they were forced to deny Allaah has speech and therefore, that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is something created and which did not originate with Allaah as speech, since He does not have any. So these were the scum, who had inherited the refuse and junk of previous nations and brought it into the Ummah and abandoned the light of revelation and guidance, and chose blood, puss and dung, over wholesome pure milk. And the Imaams of the Salaf declared them as kafirs (as a genus), and indeed filthy kafirs (as a genus) they were, for they introduced many a taaghoot (false principle) into the deen of Allaah and called the masses to it, and took them away from the language of Allah and His Messenger and took them instead to the language of Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshippers and the Hellenized Jews and Christians.    <P>
<b><u>The Second:</u> The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (Moderate-Heavy Mu'attilah)</b>. These also appeared in <u>the early second century (after 100H)</u>, and they initially appeared having adopted the usool of the Khawaarij (eternal damnation in the fire for the unrepentent sinner) and the Qadariyyah (denial of the divine pre-decree). But then they interacted with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who advised them to drink from that stream. So they drank from that stream till hearts content, and took from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> what they had hoarded from it, and they became the carriers and vanguards of this way. These <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> propounded the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the Salaf referred to them as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. They had already acquired this from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as early as around 130H, consider well <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?vcdix>this saying</a> of Ayyub al-Sakhtiyyaani. They did a great deal to refine that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> over the next 100 years (al-jawhar al-fard, al-akwaan) and they began to bottle that stuff, until they achieved dominance and began to force it on the people, giving them "forced medication for their own good." In the early third century they put the Ummah to trial by setting up inquisitions and testing the people on the saying of the creation of the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as a result of which many a righteous scholarly Imam was killed, imprisoned and beaten. They gained political dominance and they goaded the rulers and desired to pass judgement upon the truth and its people, and from their figureheads was <a href='tags/bishr-al-mareesi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bishr al-Mareesi</font></a> al-Hanafi al-Jahmi (d.218H) who inherited this way from al-Jahm and his followers. It was that great brave, <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> who subjugated these people, he persevered over oppression over the reign of four caliphs until Allaah aided His deen by giving him victory and success (around 225H-232H), and thus the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> who desired to bring blood, puss and dung to the people were abandoned by the people at large, they no longer held any position in the hearts of the people, and their political dominance also waned, they became despised, abased and rejected, and this continued for decades. Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was amongst their leaders in the late third century after hijrah (260H to 300H), and he was upon this baatil for most of his life, and he was obviously very well-versed in this matter.    <P>
<b><u>The Third:</u>The Raafidi <a href='tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a> (Hardcore Mujassimah)</b>. These were present from around <u>the end of the second century (around 180H onwards)</u>. These were the followers of <u>Hisham bin al-Hakam al-Raafidee</u> and likewise <u>Hishaam bin Saalim al-Jawaaliqee</u>, and Hisham bin al-Hakam was the leading figure of 'ilm al-kalaam, and they were upon the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad in their theology, and they were the first to say "<i>Allaah is a jism</i>" [just as al-Jahm and al-Ja'd were the first to say "<i>Allaah is not a jism</i>"]. They claimed their Lord had the shape of humans, with limbs, that he has a color and smell, and that he is equal in length, breadth and depth, and that he is flesh and blood. And so they had vile and repugnant statements. Also from them were the <u>Bayaniyyah</u> (followers of Bayan bin Sam'an) and the <u>Khattaabiyyah</u> (followers of Abu al-Khattaab al-Asadee) and the <u>Mughiriyyah</u> (followers of al-Mughirah bin Sa'id al-Ijlee) and the <u>Jawaaribiyyah</u> (followers of Dawud al-Jawaaribee). So they made tashbih and tamthil between the essence of Allaah and the essences of the humans and thus rendered Him flesh, blood, bones and limbs. These are the ones refuted by the likes of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>, and likewise by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and likewise Al-Bagdhadi in al-Farq bayn al-Firaq and others from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>The Fourth:</u> The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> (Light Mu'attilah)</b>. They appeared after the mihnah (trial) and after the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (<a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>) had been subdued and subjugated. So the story with <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> is that he was drinking upstream and was an affirmer, but he went downstream to debate those who were drinking therefrom, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. However, he was not grounded in the Sunnah and he debated those Innovators upon <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, so he partook in some of it, and he was unable to address their doubt concerning the speech of Allaah, as is  mentioned by Abu Nasr al-Sijzee (d. 444H). They (the Mu'tazilah) claimed that speech which is letter, word and <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> necessitates events (hawaadith) in Allaah's essence, and thus Allaah cannot have speech. So he innovated the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> (a singular eternal meaning), as a means to affirm speech in a way that is no longer subject to the argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and denied that Allaah's speech is tied to His will and power in the sense that Allaah speaks as and when He wills. He also said there are two Qur'ans, that which is from the eternal <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, and that which is present with us (the Arabic Qur'an). When he took this position on <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, he was forced to remain consistent with the other attributes which are like this, such as <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, love, anger, pleasure and the likes, all of which are tied to Allah's will (mashee'ah). <u>So unfortunately he drunk from that stream</u> and so <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was severe against his associates and followers, the likes of Husayn al-Karaabeesee, and Haarith al-Muhaasibee. He scorned them, and used very very severe language against them, because <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was given perspicacity and deep-rooted knowledge and perception and knew the door that these people were opening (after it had been shut and bolted). Now, the doctrinal school of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> affirmed everything for Allaah, with the exception of the <i><a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> or the <i>af'aal ikhtiyaariyah</i> which means those actions Allaah does as and when He wills (like <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, become angry, pleased, and so on), because he was made to believe that this would imply succession and sequence in time (i.e. multiple acts, other than each other), which means events take place in Allaah's essence which would render Him a body. But aside from this ta'til, he affirmed <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, and as for the Sifat Ikhtiyaariyyah, then he did not deny them outright, he simply made them  eternal attributes and removed the element of Allaah's choice from them, so as not to render them as hawaadith (events). Hence, he said Allaah is eternally angry (with whomever He is angry because he died upon disbelief) and eternally pleased, and eternally loves, and eternally has mercy and so on. <u>This was the school that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> adopted, supported and defended after leaving the Mu'tazilah</u>, and as you can see it is the closest  to Ahl al-Sunnah in the sense it is the least amount of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> recedeed from it and tended towards the Mu'azilah, Jahmiyyah). Now <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, and the early <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> rebutted the slanderous allegation against them that they were <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for affirming the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (like face, hands, eye), and this carried through in the writings of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and also <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (as we have documented elsewhere and as will appear at the right place in this series).    <P>
<b><u>The Fifth</u>: The Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> (Mujassimah, Mukayyifah)</b> <u>They appeared around 250H</u>, roughly the same time as the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>. They claimed their Lord was a body, but not like the created bodies. They were <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and they were also upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, but it led them to other conclusions. They are argued that as there are only bodies and attributes and attributes cannot exist except in bodies that are self-established (al-qaa'im bil-nafs), then Allaah must be a body. However He is unlike all other bodies in the sense that He existed for a period in eternity without any hawaadith (by which they mean presence of attributes) but by His will and power He brought about attributes in Himself, such as speech and action and the likes. This viewpoint allowed them to maintain the argument of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and they simply differed with the Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> on one of the premises which is that "<i>bodies are never devoid of hawaadith (events)</i>," the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> never accepted this absolutely, they said this is true for created bodies, but as for Allaah, He is a body and was devoid of hawaadith, until He chose to bring about events in His essence (meaning acquisition of attributes). This means that Allaah was not always mutakallim, one who speaks as and when He wills, but He became mutakallim, and thereafter will remain eternally as one who speaks  as and when He wills. So they permitted what is called hulul <a href='tags/al-hawaadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hawaadith</font></a> fee dhaatillaah (the occurrence of events in Allaah's essence, by which they mean acquisition of attributes Allaah never had before). And you should note that this is VERY different to the issue of <i><a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i>, or <i><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i>, which is Allaah doing actions as and when He wills. Further, upon this claim of Allaah being a body the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> delved into takyif (specifying how) in certain areas, in the issue of 'uluww (Allaah being above His creation) and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> (Allaah being over His Throne). They said things like Allaah is in contact, touch, adjacency to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or that He is remote with a certain distance from <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or close with a certain gap from <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and they started speculating on the takyif of Allaah's essence saying that His essence fills <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or is equivalent to it, or extends beyond it and so on from those things for which Allaah gave them no authority. And they also said Allaah is limitless in all directions except that in relation to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Some of the leading figures and proponents of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> denied that they claim Allaah is a human body in flesh, blood, bones and limbs as claimed by the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. There are some extremely important points here that you need to keep in mind, as they are crucial to understanding the context of statements made by others who rebutted them and which are misapplied by today's ignorant deluded <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who pretend to be <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. All of their views are documented in al-Ash'ari's <i>al-Maqaalaat</i>, Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi's <i>Usul al-Din</i>, and <i>al-Farq bayn al-Firaq</i>.    <P>
<b><u>The Sixth:</u> Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (d. 324H) (Moderate <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> Followed by Light Kullaabi <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> Followed by Transition <u>Towards</u> Sunni, Athari Ithbaat)</b>. We have to put him in <u>a separate category</u> for obvious reasons. He was unfortunately drinking downstream for forty years of his life, but then Allaah guided Him to leave the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and he adopted the school of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. So he moved a little upstream, but not far enough. However, he met an Imaam of the Sunnah, Zakariyyaa al-Saajee (d. 307H) from whom he took the statements of Ahl al-Hadeeth wal-Athar. And from that time, he went into a transition period in which he gradually dropped the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and tended towards the sayings of Ahl al-Hadith wal-Athar,as he learned more and more. So he continued moving upstream, removing the impurities and by the end of his life he was almost there. He explicitly stated he was upon exactly what <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was upon, even if some <u>very minor, subsidiary issues</u> from the remnants of his Kullaabi past remained with him and can be discerned with a careful reading of his works. But he ended in a state where he was overwhelmingly in agreement with Ahl al-Sunnah in all the major issues. All of this is known through his last works, <i>al-Mujiz</i>, <i>Risaalah ilaa Ahl al-Thaghar</i>, <i>al-Maqaalaat</i> and <i>al-Ibaanah</i>. The reason for isolating <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> is that whilst he was a Mu'tazili he was upon that proof of huduth al-ajsaam, considering it the foundation of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, but when he left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, his view changed and although he was unable to see it as being false and corrupt, he declared it an innovation, and unlawful to use, and he explicitly stated it is taken from the non-Muslim <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub >refer to his quote in this article</a>).    <P>
<b><u>The Seventh:</u> Abu Bakr al-Baqillaani (d. 403H) (Light <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>, Heavy Kalaam)</b>. We have to put him in his own category because he is <u>a unique and strange case</u>. We saw above that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> moved upstream towards the people of Sunnah, Hadith and Athar, and there appeared after him those who intended support of his way and his school of doctrine. However, starting with <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, they simply added their own views, orientations and preferences, and so it no longer remained "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" strictly speaking. It was simply an evolving creed that underwent many significant changes along the way. As for <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, <u>it is very unfortunate</u> that he went downstream and drunk from whence the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> drunk. He gave an elaborate and detailed treatment of huduth al-ajsaam, borrowing it all from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, with a few minor differences in subsidiary detail and he declared it obligatory. So whilst <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> went upstream, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> took matters somewhat downstream. What makes <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> unique though is that he never considered this proof to clash with affirmation of al-'uluww (and neither did <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> or al-Ash'ari) or affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (face, hands eyes). However, he declared this proof obligatory and here he opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a> on this matter. He had powerful rebuttals against the slanderous allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tasbhih that came from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> for affirmation of the attributes of face, hands and eyes.    <P>
<b><u>The Eighth</u>: The Later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Mutakallims (Tending to the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah)</b>. In this group we can start with <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H), <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> (d. 478H) and those after them. Unfortunately, they went further downstream, more than <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and they began to hold opinions that were the hallmarks of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, such as <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah (face, hands, eyes) and rejection of 'uluww and tahreef of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>. This is clear in the writings of <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a>, and even more so with <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> who was affected by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and then it just got worse and worse by the time <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> had had their fill. They were all upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam borrowed wholesale from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and as time went by, forced to remain consistent with it, they started receding towards the views and positions of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and concurring with the views of their enemies amongst the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here for an example</a>).</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Fringe-Groups</font>    <P>
It is important to mention that there were other groups that are hard to characterize. There are two groups we are going to mention here which is crucial to this entire subject and they are "Kalaamified" <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>.    <P>
<blockquote><b><u>The Hanbali Ahl al-Kalaam:</u></b> This is the Tamimi family, and they are <b>Abu al-Hasan al-Tamimi</b>, <b>Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi</b> (d. 410H), <b><a href='tags/rizqullah-al-tamimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rizqullah al-Tamimi</font></a></b> (d.448H). These kept ties with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who were heavily into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, like <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and as a result they were influenced by it to such a degree that they misrepresented the views and statements of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and ascribed to him that which he is free and innocent of. Now <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> was also from this group, but he split and separated from the Tamimis and issues broke out between them (that is the subject of a separate article in this series). But we need to keep this faction in mind because they are used in the overall strategy of the Innovators to attack Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
<b><u>The Jahmified and Mu'tazilified Hanbalis:</u></b> They are Ibn Aqeel and Ibn al-Jawzee. The former got poisoned by Mu'tazili teachers who despited being advised did not abandon them, and Ibn al-Jawzee was just mass confusion, and he had with him tajahhum and i'tizaal. Ibn Aqeel repented at the end of his life. And Ibn al-Jawzee wrote a work attacking specific <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> (Abu Ya'laa, Ibn Haamid and his own teacher, Ibn al-Zaghuni), but this attack came from a Jahmee, Mu'tazilee perspective. It is important to note that whilst they attacked some of the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, they also refuted and scorned the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> as a whole.  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Discussion of the Framework and What Follows on From it</font>    <P>
Now that we have a framework, some historical context, and a brief outline of the views of each faction, we are now in a position to move forward, and this will be done by documenting in detail the sayings of <b>a)</b> <u>Ahl al-Sunnah</u> and the <u>early Kullaabi Ash'aris</u>, <b>b)</b> the <u>Rafidi Mujassimah</u> and <b>c)</b> the <u>Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>. Through this we will have established some solid ground to then analyze the accusations of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> made against Ahl al-Sunnah by todays deluded <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
