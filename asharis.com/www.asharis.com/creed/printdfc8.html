<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
From the greatest principles of <b>al-Jahm bin Safwaan</b>, the greatest of his many taaghuts by which he misguided hordes from the Ummah,and which was inherited by others (the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidees, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), and upon which they all built their theology is:    <P>
<div align=center><blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1575; &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608; &#1593;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1608;&#1575;&#1583;&#1579; &#1601;&#1607;&#1608; &#1581;&#1575;&#1583;&#1579;</div>   Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith (events, occurrences) is itself haadith (originated).</blockquote></div>    <P>
To Jahm, Allaah's <u>attributes and actions</u> are "<i>hawaadith</i>" which must be denied in order for him not to be considered a body like all created bodies.     <P>
This taaghut was taken by al-Jahm, from al-Ja'd who in turn took it from the students of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>), and particular through the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who had already formulated a proof, <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>, to argue that the universe is originated (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>). This premise, and this proof is the foundation of deen of the Ahl al-Kalaam, and it is this very speech that was <u>explicitly</u> condemned by <b>Imam <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, <a href='tags/imam-malik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imam Malik</font></a>, Imam al-Shafi'ee and Imam Ahmad</b>, and the entirety of the Salaf. This was also the premise behind two other premises on account of which al-Jahm bin Safwaan denied Allaah's chosen actions on the one hand and claimed both Paradise and Hellfire will perish and expire on the other, as is well-documented about him.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>The true and real disputes between the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots (they are all one family, be they Mu'attilah or be they Mujassimah), is what can be affirmed or denied for Allaah, whilst maintaining this premise and the proof built around it. So the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> included attributes and chosen actions within "hawaadith". The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> likewise. The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> only include Allaah's chosen actions (those tied to His will and power) into this principle, but affirmed everything else. The very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> likewise. Then those Ash'aris who came afterwards receded towards the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and denied the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and al-'uluww for Allaah, the Exalted. The Maturidis, from the outset, were always closest to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and they never affirmed 'uluww or the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> from the very beginning. And as for the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, they said Allaah can acquire attributes he never had, but these are not really  "hawaadith" because these attributes become permanent and never expire after they have been acquired (unlike true "hawaadith"). In all of this, every single one of these groups, be they Mu'attilah or <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, are all on a united front and a single foundation, upon this particular taaghut of al-Jahm bin Safwaan ("<i>Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith  is itself haadith</i>"), and upon which their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and tahreef is based. They just differ as to how the building should be constructed upon it.</b></blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Associated Language</font>    <P>
This proof required <u>a new type of language (in definition and meaning)</u> which clearly did not exist in the language of the Arabs or nor was it known to the Muslims and their Imaams who were holding on to the light of revelation. So the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Innovators then introduced and incorporated the philosophical definitions that were already current with the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> - [who were already using this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in their own languages] - into Arabic terms, thereby introducing ambiguity, vagueness and obscurity. Subsequently, their theology was based upon a series of negations of these very terms (called "<b>negative theology</b>") such as "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, nor a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, nor an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, nor in makaan, or in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, and he is not subject to hawaadith</i> ..." and so on. And by this they aim to reject true meanings, in addition to the false meanings <u>they have deliberately loaded into these words</u>, in order to give the illusion that they are "<i>purifying Allaah of defects</i>."    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Hence, when you carefully reflect in their books, their works, their polemical writings and their polemics against Ahl al-Sunnah - and we are speaking here about <u>the pseudo-Ash'aris and the Maturidis in particular</u> who are the ones carrying the flag and banner of the heretical principle of al-Jahm bin Safwaan today - you will see that they will always focus on "definitions". You will hear them saying, "Can you define this?" "What do you  mean by that?", "We need to agree and what this means first?" and so on. It actually makes it more complex when you are speaking to them in other than Arabic, such as in English. And what they are doing is playing word games. So their theology relies upon words for which they have devised their own innovated meanings (not known in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or the language of the Arabs), meanings which are in fact borrowed from those who already delved in this type of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> from the nations gone past. Since these words now have numerous meanings [in addition to the normal Arabic meaning(s)], a degree of ambiguity has now crept in as a result. This ambiguity and generalization is what is relied upon these people to deceive others into thinking that they are calling to <u><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></u> and <u>Tanzih</u> (absolving Allaah of imperfections, defects) whereas in reality it is nothing but pure <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (divesting Allaah of what He affirmed for Himself). And this will be made very clear when we go through each of their examples.</div>    <P>
Hence, what the Ahl al-Kalam call "<b>rational evidences</b>"  are neither rational, nor evidences. They are all based upon  polluted corrupt language, and it is a means to conceal their falsehood and their opposition to the Book and the Sunnah. It is <u>this very kalaam</u> that all the Salaf condemned including the four Imaams in very unclear, unambiguous words. These are the very people whom <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik and Shafi'ee were condemning in the second century hijrah, here are some statements of Imaam Malik (d. 179H), Ibn Mahdee (d. 198H) and al-Thawree (d. 161H) as related by al-Baghawi in <i>Sharh al-Sunnah</i> (1/217):    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And <b>Malik bin Anas</b> said: "Beware of innovations." It was said to him, "O Abu Abdullaah,  and what are the innovations?" He replied, "The people of innovation who speak regarding <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, and His attributes and His speech, His knowledge and His power, and they do not remain silent about that which the Companions and those following them in goodness remained silent about.    <P>
And <b>Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdee</b> narrated from <b>Malik</b>: "If <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> had been knowledge, the Companions and Successors would have spoken about it, just as they spoke about the rulings and legislative matters. However it is baatil (falsehood), which only directs to baatil."    <P>
And <b>Sufyan al-Thawree</b> was asked about <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and he said: "Leave baatil. Where are you from the truth? Follow the Sunnah and leave bid'ah." And he also said: "I found the affair to be imitating and following (and nothing else)."</blockquote>    <P>
And this is only a very small selection of the sum whole of what is found in the speech of the Salaf regarding these deviants.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Deception About the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Prohibited by the Salaf</font>    <P>
As we have repeatedly explained in other articles on this site, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> that the Salaf condemned was this very specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, this language of <i>al-jawhar, al-jism, al-'arad</i> and so on which all of the Ahl al-Kalaam (every single group, whether they are <u>Mu'attilah</u> or <u>Mujjassimah</u>), used to speak about Allaah, His names, His speech, His power, and His attributes in general. These are the ones condemned by <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik, al-Shafi'ee, Ahmad and others, and they include the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidah, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, the Maturidiyyah and every faction who induldged in this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and spoke about Allaah, His names, attributes and actions through it. The Salaf of the first three centuries were free and innocent of it, completely.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">However, because there exists such a well-documented, very powerful rebuttal, scorn, rejection of these people in the words of the Imaams of the Salaf, they try to deceive people about "kalaam." So they start saying:     <P>
<blockquote><i>Hey, Ibn Abbaas used kalam against the Khawaarij, and Alee used it against the Raafidah, and Ibn Umar used <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> against the Qadariyyah, and <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> used <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> to debate atheists, and al-Shafi'ee used <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and so and so used <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and so on</i>.</blockquote>    <P>
And their intent is to confuse between the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> that is <u>their innovated baatil <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, (baatil directing to baatil)</u> from what they took from the refuse of the Hellenized nations, such as the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, and upon which they built their entire theology and which they  (spuriously) call "<b>Usool al-Deen</b>" and between what is generally termed as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, meaning speech, discussion, debate. As for those whose example they mention, then all of that refers to the simple assertion of the truth upon nothing but the texts of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and sound reasoning if required. <b>That's it, nothing else</b>. So this matter here is from the greatest of their deceptions <u>by which they wish to shield the reality of their particular kalaam</u>, that very specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which the Salaf condemnded so heavily, because all of their books contain nothing but this condemned <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. Pick up any standard <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> or Maturidi textbook. What is in it? The very thing for which Imaam al-Shaafi'ee would have had them paraded on horses through the streets and markets, being whipped by palm branches, with it being announced "<i>This is the recompense of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to kalaam</i>." </font></blockquote></div>    <P>
This is why you have to be extremely careful when you speak to these people, because they are operating entirely upon definitions (meaning, their innovated ones) which are concealed within Arabic words. They are not operating fundamentally from the Book, the Sunnah, and the <u>pure</u> Arabic language. When they use these general ambiguous words, a person thinks it is nothing but the pure truth, in all its ambiguity, whereas what they intend in reality, is the greatest of falsehood and it clearly clashes with what is established in the Book and the Sunnah. In this practice, they follow the same path as previous nations, the People of the Book, whom Allaah chastised in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> for "<b>distorting the words from their proper places</b>" and "<b>clothing truth with falsehood</b>" and the likes, so these verses apply to them, the Ahl al-Kalaam, just  as they applied to the People of the Book.    <P>
In this series therefore, we are going to analyze these terms, with a view to lifting that veil and exposing the undercurrent of deception that is play. And from the words we will be looking at inshaa'Allaah are: <i>al-jism, al-'arad, hulul al-hawaadith, al-tarkib, al-jihah, <a href='tags/al-hadd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hadd</font></a>, al-hayyiz, al-makaan, al-ghayr, al-taghayyur, al-iftiqar, al-munqasim, al-jawhar, al-juz', al-ab'aad, al-tasalsul, al-tashbeeh, al-dhaahir, al-harakah, al-jabar, al-nadhar</i> amongst others.    <P>
