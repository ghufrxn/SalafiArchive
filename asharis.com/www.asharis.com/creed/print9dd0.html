<p><div class='sidebar'>This is the second part to: <b>Impaling Jahmee Doubts: Does <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> Claim That Allaah Is 'Divisible' and 'Composite'? Outing the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> Known As Abu Adam Naruiji</b>. <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>View the first part here</a></div>    <P>
All praise is due to Allah and may the prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger to proceed:     <P>
In Part 1 of this article we covered the treachery and impudence of a <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> - (fraudulently posing as a follower of Abu Hasan al-Ash'ari) - who made a claim against Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, that he speaks of Allaah being "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>" (munqasim) and "<a href="tags/composite.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">composite</font></a>" (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>), and who also proceeded to make takfir of Shaykh ul-Islam on account of this (and other affairs).    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-ditch.gif align=right border=0>As he had started digging his own ditch by initiating such a slander and making such takfir, we decided to show some benevolence and aided him with a JCB digger to facilitate the affair for him. Unfortunately that was not to his liking, he went into a sulk, and decided to grab a few spades and dig his own ditch - which by responding to part 1 of our article - he has now done so, <u>completely</u>.    <P>
We clarified that Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> denies Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim), explicitly and this is found in abundance in the "Bayan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah" and many other works (see <a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>here</a>, and <a href=index11b6.html?iwemr>here</a>), and he rejects that Allaah can be described as such with these terms, upon their known established meanings in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs.     <P>
As for the likes of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, then <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explains that they invent and fabricate their own devised meanings for these terms in order to employ this as a means to reject Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (or to reject some of His Attributes), and thus, they load these newly devised meanings into terms such as:     <P>
<ul><li>"<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition),   <li>"<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" (divisibility),   <li>"iftiqaar" (need),   <li>"ghayr" (otherness),   <li>"kathrah" (numerousness) </ul>    <P>
and then they expect from and demand their opponents to reject these terms for Allaah. However, when their opponents, meaning <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and those upon the creed of the Salaf, do not fall into their sly trickery and deception, they accuse the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> of speaking with and affirming the very meanings that they fabricated in their own minds for these terms. And this is how these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are operating and it is also the way that the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, is operating in his response.    <P>
So lets make this clear, this is how things are working:    <P>
<div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'><b>Ar-Raazee:</b> If Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> which is mighty (in its size), then this means He is also Mighty and as the right part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is other (ghayr) than the left part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, the same applies to Allaah, and thus as the notion of "ghayr (otherness)" is established for Allaah on account of Him being claimed to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then this is <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> (divisibility) and separability into parts (ajzaa') - and therefore He cannot be on <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<b>Ibn Taymiyyah:</b> Your definition of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> differs to what is well-known and established in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs, and regarding the correct and established meanings of these terms, we deny them and reject them for Allaah, for Allah is al-Ahad, as-Samad, and such meanings are impossible for Allaah, and He is purified and free of them. As for the meanings you intend behind these terms then in light of that, they are general and ambiguous terms which comprise both truth and falsehood - so we reject the falsehood, which is Allaah being <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> upon the established meanings in the language. And as for the truth which you have incorporated into these terms such as "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) and "iftiqaar" (need) and "ajzaa'" (parts) and "ghayr" (otherness) and their likes in order to reject that truth, then this notion of "distinction" and "otherness" within an entity is something that every existing thing must be described with, otherwise it could not exist, since every existing thing has distinct multiple attributes. And further, <u>this mode of argument you are attempting to employ</u>, is the very same argument that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> use against you when you affirm the seven attributes, <u>and you are simply extending it and applying it to the issue of Allaah being above the Throne</u>. So we reject your argument and we are not going to reject meanings of truth that you have loaded into these terms, so that if we reject these terms in line with your whims and desires, we reject the truth along with the falsehood. So we are not falling for your trickery and deception.     <P>
And our saying is that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and He is al-Ahad, as-Samad, with composition and divisibility being impossible for Him. And your disputants are not just us, but they are also the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, such as <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (<a href=tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html>see here</a>), Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> (<a href=indexee1d.html?gcctb>see here</a>), <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a> (<a href=index4092.html?ihoxo>see here</a>) amongst others. And also it is the view of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (who is the true author of the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>  madhhab) and all of the Salaf (see al-Qurtubi's <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>corroboration of that here</a>) -  as well as many other factions from the Islamic groupings.     <P>
<b>Jahmee Baleed Naruiji: </b> See! <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> does not reject these terms, he affirms them and he says Allaah is made up of quantitative parts and is divisible!</div>    <P>
And we have quoted in another place, the saying of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in Dar' ut-Ta'aarud (1/133):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And when these words are general, then the one addressing them (i.e. addressing those using them) should either clarify and say [to them], "What do you mean by these words". If they explain them with the meaning that agrees with the Qur'aan, they are accepted. If they explain them in opposition to that, they are rejected. And either he withholds from agreeing with them in speaking with these words, in negation or affirmation. And if he withholds himself in speaking with these words with them [either in negation or affirmation of these words], they will accuse him of incapacity and severance (i.e. withdrawing). And if he speaks with these terms with them they will accuse him of applying those words that contain both truth and falsehood, and they will then make the ignorant ones to think that the application of those words encompasses false meanings from which Allaah is to be declared free of.</blockquote>    <P>
As you can see <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is certainly wise to these people and their games.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Response of the <a href="tags/jahmee-baleed.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmee Baleed</font></a></font>    <P>
In response to <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>our initial refutation</a> of the Jahmee Baleed's slander against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, he is now claiming that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has two different definitions for "divisibility" and "composition" - one which he denies and the other that he affirms and which the Jahmee has labeled as "<u>quantitative divisibility</u>", again, imputing lies to Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
After he was totally exposed and humiliated in our first part - he has now come back - a glutton for punishment - and decided to dig his hole deeper and deeper by elaborating upon his slander a bit more (25th August 2009), and squirming in trying to find angles with which to continue his slander.    <P>
    <P>
As for what he has brought in response, then inshaa'Allaah what follows will be a detailed response to it. We want to hasten the burial and funeral of this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, seeing the zeal and keenness with which he wishes to be buried, <a href=index1e45.html?hybol>after having already shown his fondness and affinity to the sandal</a> of Abdullaah bin Abi Ja'far <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, and after having zealously dug his own ditch.     <P>
So we say:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>Point 1: </u>The Argument Used by <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> regarding "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "Tajuzzee" and "Iftiqaar" and "Ghayr" is in fact based upon the Intellectual Proof of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> for the Existence of a Creator Which The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> Also Use To Reject the Attributes in Refutation of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - And As Such The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Reject This Proof Of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" And Refute It, Since It Means Negation of the Seven Attributes They Affirm</font>    <P>
We stated previously that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are a primitive species, their psychological constitution embodied in the thought process behind the response devised by <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> to the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who confused him, leading him to doubt in His Lord and abandon the prayer for forty days. And thus is the outcome of all <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who abandon the Book and the Sunnah and turn to theological speculation.    <P>
It is unfortunate that <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, does not realize that he has been forbidden to read the books like those of <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> by his later <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> due to what they contain of much of the sayings and underlying arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. However, since he has not followed the advice of the likes of Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> (d. 895H) from the  prominent later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, he has fallen prey to using specific arguments in attacking <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> which are in fact based upon the intellectual proof of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> for demonstrating the existence of a Creator and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> use this to deny attributes for Allaah - which opposes the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed of affirming seven attributes for Allaah.    <P>
And this is argument through at-tarkeeb (composition) and what is connected to that of "al-iftiqaar" (need) and "al-ghayr" (otherness) and so on.    <P>
Those demonstrating the existence of a creator through <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (theological speculation) are of two groups:    <P>
<ul><li>The Philosophers  <li> The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (a summary term for the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> indulging in kalaam)</ul>    <P>
The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> argued for the existence of a creator through the argument of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (proof through composition), and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Mu'tazilah and Ash'ariyyah) rejected this when they saw its falsehood and its use to deny any and all attributes for Allaah.     <P>
In turn, they resorted to <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>, or the indivisible  particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) and the four "akwaan" (states of being) which are al-ijtimaa' (combination, union), al-iftiraaq (separation), al-harakah (motion) and as-sukoon (rest), and the presence of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (occurrences) in bodies made up of indivisible particles - and they made this to be the foundation of their creed, being the basis of their demonstration of the createdness of the universe. However, this is also a corrupt proof, because just like the proof through "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" led the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to deny all attributes, it led the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> before them from whom the Ash'aris acquired this proof and refined in their own way - to deny many of the attributes as well.    <P>
Now <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) was a bit of a chameleon and a charlatan, he wandered in every direction, and he mixed and confused many of the sayings of the Philosopher and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> within his books, often supporting some of them.    <P>
The book "Asaas ut-Taqdees" which is depended upon by most <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> to argue in favor of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> creed of negating their is a Lord above the Heaven and a Deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, was written by <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a>, and the book does illustrate how <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> was all over the place. This is evidenced by the fact that in this book he brought together all the arguments he could find against the people of the Sunnah in their affirmation that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - so he brought the arguments of <u>the Philosophers</u>, <u>the Jahmites</u> and <u>the Mu'tazilites</u>, fused them altogether and put them altogether in this book.

And they pilfered him (i.e. won him over) in some beliefs, and he departed (getting) close to their abominable desires. For this reason, the Shaykhs warn from looking into much of his authorship.    <P>
The Shaykh Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Muqri at-Tilmisani (may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him) said, "Whoever ascertained the speech of Ibn al-Khateeb (i.e. ar-Razi) will find him stronger in corroborating the doubts than in separating from them (i.e. in repelling them), and in this there is what is not hidden (of the warning against his books).

And the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, is ignorant of this because he is still being suckled on the basics of his Jahmee Creed.

<b><u>Commentary on as-Sanusi's Words -  Part 1 - The Argument of the Philosophers</u></b>    <P>
On page 118, just after the middle of the page (highlighted with red vertical line), he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> have sought to use as proof for the negation of the Attributes (a doubt) that is close to the previously (mentioned) doubt of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and they said:    <P>
<blockquote>If attributes were present it would necessitate that they are in need (muftaqirah) of the Essence (adh-dhaat) due to the impossibility of attributes being established by themselves. And also because some of them are a condition for the others such as life (al-hayaat) which is a condition for power (al-qudrah), knowledge (al-ilm) and will (al-iraadah). So it is binding that the contigent (mashroot) is in need of the condition (shart), or (that it) comes after it according to reason. And need (al-iftiqaar) negates the necessity [of existence] since that [whose existence is] necessary is absolutely free of need, and this negates being in need (al-iftiqaar) or having requirement (al-haajah). And precedence (of the contingent) over the necessary in existence is impossible.</blockquote>    <P>
Thus, the response is to prohibit the [consequential] necessity (mulaazamah) [claimed by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> arising from our view]. For being in need (al-iftiqaar) upon another entity (al-ghayr) requires that the existence of the thing in need (al-muftaqir) is derived through (the presence of) the other entity (al-ghayr), thus, rendering it newly-arisen  (haadith, something existing after having not existed) - and we do not claim that...</blockquote>    <P>
Here, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> mentions the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that having attributes necessitates that these attributes have need (al-iftiqaar) for an essence to exist, and as we will see that this also necessitates composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) and parts (ajzaa').    <P>
<b><u>Commentary on as-Sanusi's Words -  Part 2 - Concerning the Word "al-Iftiqaar" (Need)</u></b>    <P>
If we go to the bottom of page 118 and the top of page 119, here <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if you mean by "al-iftiqaar (being in need)", [the meaning of] concomitance (mulaazamah, meaning two things existing in connection with one another), and the absence of separation of one of the two existents from the other, then we would prohibit the exceptionality, and "al-iftiqaar" with this meaning would not negate [the necessity of] existence.     <P>
So why have you (the Philosophers) said that this dependence (of the attributes) in knowledge or in existence (upon the essence) - <u>which have you have labelled as "iftiqaar (being in need)"</u> - negates the necessity of existence, or necessitates (only) its possibility...</blockquote>    <P>
Now this part is very important. Here <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is arguing against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and he is clarifying what they mean by the word "al-iftiqaar" that they are using to negate the Attributes for Allaah. In the first quote he has already responded to them and said in essence:     <P>
<blockquote>"Hey! We don't claim about Allaah what you <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> are saying, that His Attributes are in need of His Essence, and therefore this only makes their existence possible instead of necessary. Rather we say that the existence of all of Allaah's attributes are necessary in existence, along with Allaah's Essence."</blockquote>    <P>
So in other words as-Sanusi's counter to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is we are not saying what you are implying with your use of the word "al-iftiqaar" and the meaning that you have given to it.    <P>
Now in this quote, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is saying (in essence):     <P>
<blockquote>"Hey you Philosophers! If what you mean by the use of the word "al-iftiqaar" is that two things exist together (i.e. Allaah and His Attributes), in connection with each other, without one of them separating or disengaging from the other, then if this is the meaning of "al-iftiqaar" that you intend, then this does not negate the necessity of existence of those Attributes (alongside His Essence). So why then have you <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> labeled this relationship (between the Essence and the Attributes) to be "iftiqaar (being in need)", and something that negates the necessity of existence (for his Attributes and in turn for Allaah)!"</blockquote>    <P>
And this is what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> as well, who has simply brought the doubt of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. If we go back and look at the quotation that was the basis of Naruiji's initial slander against Ibn Taymiyyah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-440-quote.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We will find here what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying against <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is what <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is saying against the Philosophers:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it is said to him (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>): Your saying, "<i>If He was divisibe (munqasim), He would be composed, assembled (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - and its invalidation has already preceded</i>", and the reply against that which he (ar-Raazee) has labeled as "murakkab (composed, assembled)" has already preceded and it was made clear that there is no proof at all for the impossibility of that.    <P>
Rather, it was made clear that declaring that impossible necessitates the abolition of every existing thing, and had he not referred to what has preceded we would not have referred to it. And what is contained of generality in the word "at-tarkeeb (composition)", and "al-hayyiz (space)" and "al-ghayr" (other)" and "al-iftiqaar" (need) has already preceded, and that the [particular] meaning that they (the likes of ar-Raazee) intend, it is necessary that every existing thing be described with it, regardless of whether it's [existence] is necessary (i.e. Allaah) or possible (i.e. the creation), and that saying that this is impossible necessitates pure sophistry.    <P>
And it was made clear that it is binding upon every one to speak with the likes of this meaning which (he ar-Raazee) has labelled as "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition), until even the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and that this disputant (ar-Raazee) [himself] speaks with the same as this in the multiplicity of attributes [that he, <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, affirms for Allaah], and that he (ar-Raazee) has made binding upon the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> the likes of that.</blockquote>    <P>
So you can see what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying. We have clarified this repeatedly to this dumb Jahmee, but he persists in his slander and his takfeer of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah).    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sharf ud-Din Ibn at-Tilmisani said: And when al-Fakhr [ud-Din ar-Razi] believed the correctness of this proof, meaning the doubt of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that "al-iftiqaar" - with the meaning of unrestricted dependence - necessitates (only) the possibility (of existence), and that every composed (thing) is in need of its (<a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>) part (juz') and (in need of) the part that is other than it, and that anything that is need of what is besides it cannot (have) except a possible (existence), and (the doubt of) the presumption of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) [for Allaah] through consideration of the attributes - [so <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, believing in the correctness of all that] when he used these precepts in seeking evidence for the possibility (of existence) of everything that is besides Allaah, the Exalted, he perceived (that this also meant) the invalidation of the attributes of Allaah, the Exalted. So on one occasion he (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>) said, "<i>This is from (amongst those affairs) in which we beseech Allaah, the Exalted, for counsel</i>"...</blockquote>    <P>
And then a little later, on page 120    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and from the repugnance of his madhhab (i.e. ar-Razi's) his reducing the Attributes to being mere ascriptions and attributions (i.e. have no existence outside of the mind), and his labeling them in some places as "heterogenous to the Essence" (meaning different to the Essence), alongside what is known that the leading Scholars of the Sunnah [he means amongst the Ash'arites] prohibit the application of "al-ghayriyyah (otherness)" to His, the Most High's Attributes, because of what this permits of the correctness of separation (between Allaah and His Attributes), just as they prohibit that it be said, "They (the Attributes) are Him (Allaah) because of what this permits of the  meaning of "al-Ittihaad" (union through combination).     <P>
And what has led him (i.e. ar-Razi) to most of these corrupt views is fleeing entirely from "at-tarkeeb" (composition) which the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> have presumed to be binding from the affirmation of the Attributes, and for that reason, they negated them - whilst (we should note) that something does not increase (numerically) on account of the numerousness of its attributes and nor does it increase (numerically) on account of the numerousness of its considered qualities (such as hearing, seeing, speaking)...</blockquote>    <P>
The essence of the above quotes is that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> got affected by the doubt of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" composition - which is that if Allaah was described with Attributes, it would amount to Him being composed of distinct parts that are "other" to each other - and thus he had strange statements on the Attributes, on account of being confused by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.     <P>
And when he got confused and tried to flee from the "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> made binding upon the likes of him, it was this same way of thinking and this underlying doubt and argument that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> in turn used to deny that Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, by claiming it necessitates Allaah is compose of parts (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>).     <P>
So just as <u><a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a></u> is saying to <u>the Philosophers</u> that:    <P>
<blockquote>Our affirmation of attributes does not necessitate composition through parts (ajzaa') or numerousness (kathrah, ta'addud), even if you fraudulently label that as <a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a></blockquote>    <P>
Then <u><a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></u> is saying to <u><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></u> (who is bringing this same doubt of the Philosphers),     <P>
<blockquote>Our affirmation of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> does not necessitate He is composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (into parts) based upon the corrupt necessities and inventions of your mind. Rather He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and He is al-Ahad as-Samad, and the meanings of composition are impossible for Him because He is as-Samad, and your claimed necessity (of composition through parts) is not binding from what is the manifest truth of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence - which is what all the Salaf affirmed and the earliest Asha'ri Scholars also affirmed that too. And as for your use of these words "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition), "iftiqaar" (need), "ghayr" (otherness), "ajzaa'" (parts) and so on, then you are fraudulently labeling correct and true  meanings with these terms in an attempt to reject the truth - just like the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> argue against you, claiming that  you (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>) affirm "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) for Allaah on account of your affirmation of the attributes.</blockquote>    <P>
So either an-Naruiji:    <P>
<ul><li>Affirms that as-Sanusi's refutation of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is correct in which case Ibn Taymiyyah's refutation and response to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is correct - since <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is simply extending the very same proof of "composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>)" of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> against those affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<li>Or he affirms that that the saying of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is correct, and thus the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed necessitates Allaah is composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) of parts (ajzaa'), and thus his own creed is invalidated.</ul>    <P>
<b>Thus, we require a firm, honest and upright answer from the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> with respect to his slander against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on the basis of ar-Razi's proof of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" which <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>  borrowed from the Philosophers!</b>    <P>
<b><u>Commentary on as-Sanusi's Words - Part 5 - What is Binding Upon ar-Razi</u></b>    <P>
As-Sanusi continues on page 120, in the middle of the page, quoting at-Tilmisani, and you can refer to the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> (Notes) of al-Hamidi (which we have used to ensure accuracy of meaning and intent):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sharf ud-Din bin at-Tilmisani said: And at-Tarkeeb (composition) in [Allaah's} Essence is binding upon him (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>) as well, because the quiddity (the true essence of a thing) of every attribute amongst life (al-hayaat), knowledge (al-ilm), power (al-qudrah), will (al-iraadah) are distinguished (mutamayyizah) from the others in the mind. From them are those that have no connection (to others) such as life (al-hayaat), and from them are those that do have connection, but do not have influence (upon other things) such as knowledge (al-ilm). And from them are those which are connected and also have influence such as power (al-qudrah) and will (al-iraadah). So when they are distinguished (from each other) and are different (to each other in Allaah's Essence), they (the Attributes) necessitate different aspects in that which is required for them (to exist) [meaning Allaah's Essence], and when the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> realized that, then it was not possible for them except to deny the Attributes, and so they deceived the Muslims in applying them (to Allaah) whilst negating their realities (haqaa'iq), and they explained them (the attributes) with affairs that are different to their true essence - such as their explanation of Him being knowing (aalim) as meaning "He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) or established within a body (meaning He is not a body or an incidental attribute of a body)"...</blockquote>    <P>
And the meaning here from what <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> has quoted from Ibn at-Tilmisani is that it is binding upon <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> to affirm composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) for Allaah - through this mode of argument - because the true essences (quiddities) of Allaah's Attributes are distinguishable in the mind in relation to Allaah's Essence - and when the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> realized that this was necessitated by their proof of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (for the createdness of the universe), and meant that the attributes are separate, distinguishable parts within the Essence, they had to deny the Attributes to keep their proof intact, so they began to play games by affirming them in wording but making <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of them, so the meaning of Alaah being "aalim" (knowing) is that "He is not a body" - this is what some of the Philosopher started doing. So all of this is binding upon <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and it is necessary for him to affirm Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) if he is going to affirm the Attributes for Allaah and use the likes of these proofs.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And this is exactly what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> in his response to him in many places in the "Bayaan", and we have quoted many instances of that - you can scroll back up and read the statement of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> we just quoted. However, the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has refused except to pass judgement upon himself with ignorance, deceit, treachery, lowliness and ignominy. </div>    <P>
<b><u>Commentary on as-Sanusi's Words - Part 6 - Refutation of Another Doubt Regarding Allaah's Composition Through Parts and Claim of "Numerousness"</u></b>    <P>
And <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> said, regarding the doubt of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, that if Allaah's Attributes were the presence of multiple meanings, then they would be eternal entities existing with Him from eternity - and that this is what they, the Heretics, mean by "Numerousness (takatthur) of the eternal (i.e. Allaah) would be necessitated by those meanings (i.e. Attributes)".    <P>
So he replies to this (top of page 121 after a few lines):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The consensus is that al-Qadeem (meaning Allaah) is one, and the answer [to their doubt] is to prohibit the binding necessity (they are trying to establish). So if you mean by "numerousness of the Eternal One" that He is composed (tarakkub) and has many parts (ajzaa') on account of the presence of the Attributes, then (the response is) that numerousness of attributes does not prohibit the oneness of the one being described with them, and nor does is it necessitate His <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition), and nor is it said regarding Him on account of (the Attributes) that "He is many", neither in the language, nor in customary usage, and nor in the intellect. </blockquote>    <P>
As-Sanusi here is responding similar to what he did before which is to rebut the presumption of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition through distinct parts, ajzaa') on the basis of the claim that multiple meanings (i.e. the Attributes) necessitate that multiple parts had to exist with Him in eternity.    <P>
And then <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> elaboratese on this further - first giving the example that the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) is described as being one, even if it is described with multiple attributes. So this is <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> illustrating that within the creation there can be found that which alongside being one (i.e. indivisible), can also be described with multiple attributes.    <P>
And that if they (the Philosophers) mean by "Numerousness of the Eternal One" that the meaning of (eternity) is present for more than one reality (i.e. for the various attributes in addition to the essence), then we would prohibit the exceptionality, and it would then be necessary that you have used the claim as part of the evidence itself. Then after this he says (bottom half of page 121):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the consensus that you (the Philosophers) have quoted that "al-Qadeem (the Eternal) is One", it is necessary that it's meaning be:     <P>
<blockquote>Al-Qadeem (the Eternal One with no beginning) described with the attributes of uloohiyyah, the Mighty and Majestic, is One, there is no second to Him</blockquote>    <P>
And not that (it should be):    <P>
<blockquote>The reality of eternity (with no beginning) is not established except for a single thing (shay waahid) without looking at its being described [if it is an  Essence] or [it being] an attribute</blockquote>    <P>
as you (the Philosophers) have understood.    <P>
Yes, the word "al-Waahid (the One)" can be applied in the manner we have said, and also upon what you (the Philosophers) have mentioned, so you should stop (employing) the shared (meanings) in the word (i.e. the word al-Waahid) through which you have deceived (others), and instead say (clearly): "<i>The Ummah is unanimously agreed that He does not have attributes</i>" and in this case you will not find any way to (establish) the correctness of this. And how can unanimous consensus have taken place regarding (something) the opposition to which clear evidences have been established.</blockquote>    <P>
Here what <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is saying to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> can be explained as:    <P>
<blockquote>What you mean by the statement "al-Qadeem is only one", meaning that eternity can only be affirmed for a single entity, and that this is a matter of consensus - then you have understood it wrongly. Rather, the correct way to understand it is that "al-Qadeem (the eternal one with no beginning) is described with attributes, and there is no other entity sharing that eternity with Him", so he is a single entity that is eternal and He has attributes. And what you have done is to take this word "al-Waahid" and tried to claim it refers to the meaning that you have stated (i.e. an essence without attributes) - so you have tried to deceive the people through this play with the meanings and definitions of words. And instead of doing that, why don't you come straight out and say, "the consensus of the Ummah is that Allaah has no attributes" - instead of playing about and saying, "the consensus of the Ummah is that al-Qadeem can only be One (waahid)", by which you actually mean, "al-Qadeem has no attributes".</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>And we can say here:</b> This is the very same response that is given to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> on the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, that this necessitates He is "composed" and not "al-Waahid". Why don't you come straight out and say, "<i>the unanimous consensus of the Ummah is that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the heaven</i>" - and in that case your fraud will become apparent to all people. Instead, you play about with the word "al-Waahid" and "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) and so on - deceiving the people, and saying that if Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> which is mighty, He too would be Mighty, and since the right part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is other than the left part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then the same would apply to Allaah, and hence distinguishable parts are established for Allaah, and this means Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>). So the response of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is the same as the rebuttal of the saner <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - who are sounder in the understanding of their own creed than <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> - against the Philosophers!    <P>
And in the end it becomes clear that all of these are the delusions of their minds, they fabricate and invent these false necessities and claim they are binding from what the revealed texts affirm - whether that be Allaah being described with Attributes, or Allaah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.</div>    <P>

<b><u>What Just Happened?</u></b>    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, along with his students attempted to slander <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> based upon one of his statements in which he was rebutting an argument used by <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) which is actually the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (the proof through composition "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>") used by them to demonstrate the universe has a Maker. However, this proof necessitated that they reject all the attributes, because the attributes would have - in their view - constituted distinct parts, being in need of the whole, thereby rendering Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>), and thus created - thus falsifying the proof.  And the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> deceptively included Allaah being described with multiple attributes under the label of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) and "iftiqaar" (need) and "ajzaa'" (parts) and so on.    <P>
Now, <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> simply tried to use every argument he could - even if it came from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - in order to negate Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. So he used this issue of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>", composition.    <P>
So <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> stated that the meanings that you are entering into these terms (tarkeeb, iftiqaar, ajzaa' etc.) - besides those that are the established known meanings in the language - then if you deny those meanings (the ones you have invented) through denial of these terms, you are denying the existence of every single thing, because it is impossible to deny these meanings you have included behind these terms for anything in existence - which is that all existing things are described with multiple attributes which are distict from one another. And <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says that all <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is doing is simply extending the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" to deny that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. And we reject the established meanings  in the Arabic language of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and so on for Allaah, but as for what they (the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and ar-Razi) are trying to do with these words, then we won't fall for that deception - because by that they are intending to reject all the Attributes, or reject that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
So the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> jumped on this statement (which we have quoted a little earlier in this article) and claimed: See! <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying Allaah must be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and made of parts! Whereas what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying is something else. In fact, what he is saying is exactly what <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is saying - and we have seen how <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> has rebuked and reprimanded <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> for falling into the nest of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and using their argument of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>". So the essence of the situation is that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> - who is a prominent and important later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> whose books are standard Asha'ri texts - are both refuting <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (and therefore, the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> by necessity).    <P>
So what happened above is that the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> got sent hurtling into the stratosphere with the equivalent of a few Hiroshimas, and he is now hurtling his way down to the crater - and this is the end result of those who are brazen enough to make takfir of the righteous scholars on account of things that those scholars do not even believe or hold as their religion before Allaah.   <P>
