<p><div align="right"><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0></div>    <P>
At the outset, it is important to clarify words and terminologies that may be used throughout this series of articles, and thus, to get the formalities out of the way:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/subjugate.gif border=0>    <P>
Thereafter, in previous articles we addressed just some of the many doubts of the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> fraudulently posing as followers of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (<a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>see here</a>) and in particular:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li>Their claim that <a href='tags/muhammad-abduh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Abduh</font></a> was the originator and founder of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> - <a href=index5b9a.html?jlaoi>see here</a>. And this claim of theirs exposed them from the outset as deluded compound ignoramuses. It does not do your image or your cause any good if - when you initiate your attack against Ahl us-Sunnah - you give  the impression to the people from the very start that you work full time as a clown in a circus, and that history and creed is something you do in between the breaks. <u>At least be serious, and make serious claims, so you can be taken a bit more seriously</u>.  <li> Their claims regarding the use of the phrases "bi dhaatihi" and "bi haddin" and "baa'inun min khalqihi" which are reported from the Imaams of the Salaf - see <a href=index6afa.html?darjp>here</a>, <a href=index91e1.html?voloh>here</a> and <a href=index86d6.html?ydwuv>here</a>.  <li> Their attempts to malign Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> through some alleged statements of adh-Dhahabi - <a href=series/imaam-adh-dhahabi-ibn-taymiyyah-and-the-naseehah-dhahabiyyah.html>see here</a>.  <li> Their claim that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> originated the saying that Allaah descends without <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becoming unoccupied of Him - <a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>.  </ul></div>    <P>
And this is only a fraction of their misguidance. So after subduing these <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> <u>who have no shame in claiming there is no Lord above the heaven</u> (<a href=indexaacc.html?nogrp>being more bold in that than their <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> predecessors</a>) they responded in a somewhat <u>subdued</u> and <u>pusillanimous</u> tone without really addressing the major and central issues for which they were disciplined in the articles above - and thus their subjugation is warranted.    <P>
And it is from honoring the course of discussion that if you raise the issue of <a href='tags/muhammad-abduh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Abduh</font></a> being the founder of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> - by way of example - and then you are subdued, exposed and humiliated for making such a claim, and then in turn you want to respond - that you must respond in a manner that keeps within the actual <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> of the claim you originally made. And likewise, if you claim that it was not from the way of the Salaf to say "bi dhaatihi" or "baa'inun min khalqihi" or "bi haddin" and then it is clearly established otherwise, then you've got to address why you made that false claim in the first place, instead of moving away from that and trying to forge your own explanations for these phrases. And likewise, if you reviled <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, accusing him of originating the issue of whether Allaah's <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> becomes unoccupied when He descends or not, claiming this was not something that the Salaf spoke about - <a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>and then you were rounded up and taken care of by the sandal</a> - it was necessary for you to address your falsehood and keep the discussion within the issue and to bring us what knowledge you have of the issue. And likewise when you tried the cheap shot of using some suspect words ascribed to <a href='tags/imaam-adh-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam adh-Dhahabi</font></a>, which nevertheless were against you and not for you, <a href=indexc4ef.html?cigdy>and then you were appropriately disciplined and exposed</a>, then it was binding upon you to respond in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So when you flee and avoid the specific issues that you raised in the first place, and then start writing generalised "apologetica" for your creed as a response - this shows that you have acknowledged defeat and that you've abandoned the battlefield, <b>and that you've chosen the ease and comfort of the house duty over the toil and hardship of the field</b>.</div>    <P>
And the explanation of that in more detail will be elaborated upon in the rest of this series inshaa'Allaah. So we say, and in no particular order of preference regarding the issues to be discussed:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning the Jahmites' Acknowledgement Regarding the Phrase "Bi Dhaatihi" Used by the Salaf And Their Attempt To Pass This Off As Being "Ilm ul-Kalaam"</font>    <P>
In one of their lectures on the biography of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, one of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> from Philadelphia made numerous remarks regarding what has been reported from the Salaf of their use of phrases such as "bi dhaatihi" (with His Essence) and "bi haddin" (with a demarcation) and so on, and he rambled stating that the likes of these phrases are not found in the Book and the Sunnah and that the way of the Salaf was to stop at what is in the Book and the Sunnah and that "this was their methodology", and he claimed it was the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> who began saying some of these things, and that the likes of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> were not upon this. And we covered this speech <a href=index6afa.html?darjp>in this article</a>.    <P>
In their response this is what they have now written:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/philly-subdue-quote-bi-dhaatihi-a.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And regarding this there are a number of points of subjugation:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>Point 1:</u> The Claim of the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> That Allaah is Everywhere</font>    <P>
Concerning their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In the early days following their time, rightly guided scholars like Abdullah Ibn Mubaarak were faced with new challenges. One challenge was the Jahmiyyah's claim that Allah is everywhere by his essence.</blockquote>    <P>
Jahm bin Safwan claimed Allaah is everywhere and in everything after he got confused by the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>. So when they debated him, he said, "Leave me for a while" and he went back and concocted a belief through which he could convince them of His Lord. And the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> only believed in what could be perceived by the senses and they also believed in the transmigration of souls. So he said that just like you believe that souls occupy your bodies without you having seen them, or touched them, or spoken to them, or smelt them, or heard them, then similarly Allaah is everywhere, even though you cannot see Him, touch Him, speak to Him, hear Him or smell Him, and as He cannot be perceived by the senses, then He cannot be described with anything - even though His existence is manifest in everything.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And the invention of this belief is what the creed of all the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) returns back to - this creed of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> is the spring and foundation for all of the Ittihaadiyyah, Hulooliyyah and Mu'attilah and it has two elements to it: a) <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> and Ittihad, which is Allaah being everything and in everything and b) <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>, which is the negation of all names, descriptions, attributes, qualities, and actions. See further below.</div>    <P>
And when <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> concocted this viewpoint, it was to avoid falsifying the intellectual proof he used initially to convince them, which was what later became known as "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and "hudooth ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam" - which is to argue that since qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and events, occurrences (hawaadith) are found in bodies, it proves that bodies are newly-arisen (haadithah) and thus, created and anything which is newly-arisen (created), must be preceded by the one that brought them about. So in this manner he sought to convince the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> of the creator. And when they subsequently asked him, "We accept there is a Lord then, now describe your Lord to us", then he realized that if he described his Lord with what is in the Book and the Sunnah it would falsify his proof. So he got confused, and he concocted the creed which essentially constituted two foundations:    <P>
<ul><li> <u>Foundation 1:</u> That Allaah is everywhere, in every place and is contained in all things, even though He can't be seen, heard, felt, touched, and smelt just like a soul is found within a body and can't be perceived by any of the senses. And with this foundation Jahm was able to redress the doubt of the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<li> <u>Foundation 2:</u> And following on from the above, that Allaah is not described with anything that the creation is described with - otherwise that would falsify the proof used by Jahm to establish Allaah's existence, because if Allaah is described with hearing, seeing (to Jahm: <u><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></u>), or love, anger,  pleasure (to Jahm: <u><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></u>), or <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, instances of speech (to Jahm: <u>hawaadith</u>), then it means He is a created body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)  </ul>    <P>
And the creed of the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - those saying Allaah is everywhere - and that of the Mu'attil <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - those negating that Allaah can be described with anything, until they negated two opposites from Him, such as not being within the universe and not being outside of it - were both derived from the creed concocted by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> in the course of his debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>When we describe contemporary <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> as <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, then it is in reference to the Mu'attil <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, those who negate what Allaah affirmed for Himself, treating that as being <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and hawaadith (incidental attributes and occurrences) - and <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> was the chief and flagbearer of this, and then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah all have their share of this flag.</div>    <P>
So when our <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> speak of this challenge of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, then we need to understand what specifically, precisely and exactly this challenge was. And the debates of Jahm with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> are known and reported in the early books of aqeedah, and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> has made mention of this in "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" and there are narrations in al-Laalikaa'ees "Sharh Usool il-I'tiqaad" establishing this, besides many other sources.    <P>
And the reason why it is important to understand this is because the creed that our <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> are upon - which is the deen built upon al-jawhar (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) and al-'arad (incidental attribute) and <a href='tags/kalam-atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalam <a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a></font></a> (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) is actually derived from the usool (foundations) of Jahm and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who followed Jahm in that. And you can refer to <a href=index7863.html?upfkv>this article</a> that covers Jahm and the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> in more detail. These people (the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> and all those claiming adherence to the Ash'ari creed) all tend towards the creed of the Mu'attil <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - those who say Allah is not above, nor below, not in the universe, nor outside the universe and so on.     <P>
So it grieves them that the Salaf, like Ibn al-Mubaarak and  many others, used phrases  like "<i>baa'inun min khalqihi</i>" and "<i>bi dhaatihi</i>", it truly grieves them, because their real affectations are with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who negate that their is a Lord above the true and real created entity that is <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (<a href='tags/al-arsh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/arsh.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Arsh</font></a></font></a>) - see <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> on <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> being <a href=index69ed.html?pehic>a true and real created entity</a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>Point 2:</u> The Saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak</font>    <P>
Concerning their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Abdullah Ibn Mubaarak's method of response was "No, he's  everywhere by his knowledge, but "ala <a href='tags/arsh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arsh</font></a> bi dhatihi" (beyond his <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> essentially). It must be understood that Ibn Mubaarak was speaking out of necessity as a means to refute the Jahmiyya.</blockquote>    <P>
It is not directly and explictly reported from Ibn al-Mubaarak that he said, "bi dhaatihi", however it is reported from him that he said, "baa'inun min khalqiih" (separate from His creation), and "bi haddin" (with demarcation) in relation to Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>. And we have covered the saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak <a href=index86d6.html?ydwuv>here</a> and <a href=index91e1.html?voloh>here</a>. However, in  what has been quoted "'alal-arsh bi dhaatihi" is a meaning that is correct, even though it is not reported directly and explicitly from Ibn al-Mubaarak as his speech, but it is a meaning that is comprised in the sayings of Ibn al-Mubaarak "baa'inun min khalqihi" (separate from His creation) and "bi haddin" (above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, with a demarcation).     <P>
There is a narration that adh-Dhahabi mentions in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p. 255) from Abu Nasr al-Waa'ilee as-Sijzee, from his book "al-Ibaanah", that he said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Our leading scholars such as ath-Thawree, Maalik, the two Hammaads, Ibn Uyainah, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Fudayl (bin Iyaad), Ahmad and Ishaaq (bin Raahawaih) are upon agreement that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence (bi dhaatihi), and that his knowledge is in every place.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is reported as the meaning of what those Imaams of the religion were upon, that all their words and statements are with the meaning that Allaah is upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, bi dhaatihi, with His Essence, but as for an explicit narration that Ibn al-Mubaarak said the words "bi dhaatihi", then we have not come across such a report.    <P>
As for those from whom "<u>baa'inun min khalqihi</u>" has been reported, then they are:     <P>
<ul><li>Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181H)  <li> Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. after 200H)  <li> Hishaam bin Ubaydullaah <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 221H)  <li> Saneed bin Dawud al-Maseesee (d. 226H)  <li> <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal (d. 241H)  <li> Yahyaa bin Mu'aadh <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 258H)  <li> Al-Muzani (d. 264H), the companion of ash-Shafi'i  <li> Abu Zur'ah <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 264H)  <li> Abu Hatim <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 277H)  <li> Ibn Abee Shaybah (d. 297H)  <li> Hammaad al-Booshanjee al-Hafidh  <li> Abul-Qasim Sulayman bin Ahmad at-Tabarani (d. 360H)  <li> <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> al-Ukbari (d. 387H)  <li> Abu Nu'aym al-Asbahani (d. 430H)  <li> Ma'mar bin Ahmad bin Ziyad al-Asbahani (d. 418H), Shaykh of the Soofees  <li> Ibn Abee Zamaneen (d. 399H)  <li> Abu Amr Uthmaan bin Abil-Hasan as-Suhrawardee (muhaddith, from the leading Shafi'i scholars of his time)  <li> Muhammad bin Mahmood bin Surah at-Tamimi (Faqih of Neesapur)  <li> Isma'il bin Muhammad bin Surah at-Tamimi   <li> Shaykh ul-Islam Abu Isma'il al-Ansari al-Harawi (d. 481H)  <li> Abu al-Fath Nasr al-Maqdisi (d. 490H)  <li> Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Wahb al-Malikee  </ul>    <P>
And amongst them are Hanbalis, Malikis, Shafi'is, Muhadditheen, Huffaadh, Fuqahaa, and heads of the Sufiyyah (and we mean the early Sufiyyah, those upon Zuhd, not the later heretical Sufiyyah who are upon <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> and Ittihaad). So the like of this statement is reported way after Ibn al-Mubarak from a large number of the Scholars.    <P>
And as for "<u>bi dhaatihi</u>", then adh-Dhahabi mentions it in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p. 255) from the likes of:    <P>
<ul><li>Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani  <li>Ibn Abi Shaybah  <li>Uthmaan bin Sa'eed d-Darimi  <li>Yahya bin Ammar  <li>Abu Nasr as-Sijzee  <li>Ibn Abdul-Barr  <li>Abu Isma'il al-Ansari  <li>Abul-Hasan al-Kurji ash-Shaafi'ee  <li>Taqi ud-Din Ibn as-Salah  <li>Ahmad bin Thabit at-Turaqi  <li>Abdul-Qadir al-Jilani  <li>Abdul-Aziz al-Qahiti</ul>    <P>
And the phrase "<u>bi haddin</u>" is well-known from Ibn al-Mubarak and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, which was used to counter the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. And if it wasn't for the fear of prolonging the matter, we would have brought each and every single quotation in this regard, from those listed above.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>And Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> "bi dhaatihi" is also something affirmed by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, and al-Baqillani and other early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> as stated by <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (<a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>see this article here</a>).</b> </div>    <P>
So in the words of the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> we have an acknowledgment that such phrases were used by the Salaf, even though previously it was asserted by the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a>, that this was not the way of the Salaf, or of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and that they stopped where the Qur'aan and Sunnah stopped, and they found fault with <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> accusing him of initiating such sayings. As these narrations cannot be denied, and they are authentically related from <a href='tags/abdullaah-ibn-al-mubaarak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah Ibn al-Mubaarak</font></a>, and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> affirmed what Ibn al-Mubaarak said, then <b>the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> are now forced to acknowledge thereby</b>, that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> was not the  originator of these statements - and to claim such a thing is intellectual fraud that immediately exposes the claimant as a intellectual fraudster.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In addition to this, when you excuse the likes of Ibn al-Mubaarak - from your perspective - of using this phrase in the face of the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, then those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> did not disappear from this earth - they remained (may Allaah cause them to perish), and their saying was inherited by others, and <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> was transmitted through the Ummah, and their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> was inherited by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah, and their <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> was also inherited by others who spread it - so if you excuse Ibn al-Mubaarak for using the likes of these words in order to refute the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, then when the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> spoke on the basis of what was narrated from Ibn Mubaarak, it wasn't idle chatter to pass away time in Damascus, it was because of the presence of the same Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Ittihaadis amongst the Ummah in greater numbers than in the time of Ibn al-Mubaarak. Thus anyone who takes issue with <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and his discussion of the issue of the phrase "bi haddin", <u>then he immediately exposes himself as an intellectual fraudster</u>. And this is because the need that arose for the likes of Ibn al-Mubaarak to make this clarification is present today with much more intensity and urgency due to the presence of the descendants of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the Ittihaadi and Hulooli Soofees.</div>    <P>
And likewise, when there are present today the same Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in the form of the extremist Soofees and other than them, in large numbers in all parts of the world, then anyone who finds fault with those who use the phrases "bi dhaatihi" and "baa'inun min khalqihi" and "bi haddin" in the course of addressing the false belief of these people, then he immediately exposes himself as an intellectual fraudster.     <P>
And we make a distinction between using these phrases in the course of refuting falsehood, and between using these phrases in the matter of affirming ones belief. In the latter case, when we simply outline and state our belief, then such expressions are not necessary. Thus, when we explain our belief to the people we say, "Allaah is above the Throne", and if a situation demands that we say, "bi dhaatihi" or "baa'inun min khalqihi", and "bi haddin" - with the  meaning intended by Ibn al-Mubaarak, then we say that in order to remove doubt and confusion.      <P>
Thus, when it is the case that the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are present in greater numbers than they ever existed previously, and when it is the case that confusion regarding where Allaah is, with many societies in the Muslim lands believing that Allaah is everywhere with His Essence, then there is no rebuke for those who say, "bi dhaatihi" and "baa'inun min khalqihi" because these are all true meanings, appropriate to the situation.    <P>
However, this truly and really grieves the likes of the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of our time - why because, they don't actually believe there is a Lord above the   true and real created entity that is <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and which is above the seven heavens. And when it is the case that the belief  of Allaah being everywhere with His Essence is spread in the Ummah today more so than it was in the time of Ibn al-Mubaarak, then it is from talbees (deception) and hypocrisy for the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> and their likes from all over the world to find fault with the phrases "bi dhaatihi" and "baa'inun min khalqihi".    <P>
