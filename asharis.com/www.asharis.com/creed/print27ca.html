<p><img src=assets/images/aa-logo.gif align=left border=0> Following the <a href=index6f5c.html?brner>very successful launch</a> at <a href='tags/aristotelians-anonymous.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelians Anonymous</font></a> (thanks to all those that popped in, its one of the most popular articles) - we are pleased to announce <u>our first workshop</u>. As you will have gathered from the launch, we do have a serious situation on our hands - souls, intellects and lives are at risk from this insidious and very harmful intoxicant that is behind some of the most tragic <u>accidents</u> in history. Our workshops are aimed at helping  victims and sufferers to build up their confidence in facing up to reality and to make strong commitments in effecting real change in their lives.    <P>
Our core principles are to <u>serve</u> victims and sufferers to help them to <u>recovery</u> and through that bring about <u>unity</u> - by eliminating the menace of <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> and poisoning that has led to splitting (of <u>bodies</u>), unruly behaviour, and unwarranted charges of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (based upon Aristotle's al-Jawhar al-'Arad - <a href=indexab1a.html?iowfm>see here</a>) against innocent Muslims.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aristotles-liquor-c.gif align=right border=0><font class='titleHeadline'>The AA Presents: Facing Up to the Facts and Realities And Overcoming the First, Big Hurdle: Admission!</font>    <P>
As we mentioned in the <a href=index6f5c.html?brner>launch</a> most victims are introduced to the bottle through predators who convince gullible victims that the veracity and truthfulness of the religion of Islam cannot be ascertained and verified except through an intellectual proof (called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" or "hudooth ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam"), and that without this, Islam itself will be destroyed by all those 'nasty, evil' atheists. This is despite the fact that belief in Allaah's  Existence is inherent in every soul, it is deeply and firmly rooted in the fitrah and it is not what the call of the Messengers was based around. Belief in a creator is inherent and implanted in every soul, it is from the fitrah, and <a href='tags/ibn-hajr-al-asqalani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani</font></a> refuted the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> on this issue (see <a href=index2047.html?osliq>here</a> and <a href=indexed3f.html?vaztl>here</a>). Once convinced of this erroneous and grossly exaggerated claim, the victim obliges and is duly "spiked" by the predator. A pint of Aristotle's "Maqoolaat" is enough to hook the victim. This then leads to life-long bondage to the bottle of "al-jawhar wal-'arad", and the victim is unable to speak without it. It is made the ultimate criterion of what can and cannot be said of Allaah, in both affirmation and negation, and all the revealed texts are subject to evaluation through the associated language and terminology of this <b>Vintage 322BC</b>. Unfortunately, victims rarely realize that they are intoxicated and  "<u>creeding under the influence</u>" and speaking language that is foreign to the revealed Books and sent Messengers. It becomes extremely difficult to convince them about their addiction, that it was by no means an <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, that they were in fact mislead into the whole thing, and that through their indulgence in such frivolity, separation of bodies will occur, and harm the Muslims.    <P>
And often these intoxicated victims will be found lurking on blogs and forums and spluttering "<i>Not above, nor below, nor to the left, nor to the right, nor inside the universe, nor outside the universe, not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, nor a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in location, not in direction</i> ..." - and at the same time vehemently denying that they've been anywhere near the bottle! We really do need to help these people. Poor souls.    <P>
This first workshop will focus on bringing facts out in the open and participants are asked to be very honest and frank about what they experience. The first stage in resolving any problem is to admit and acknowledge <u>that there actually is one</u>. If you don't, you will simply continue in your deluded life, none the wiser.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important Note to Program Participants:</b> What follows may be very upsetting, disturbing and may bring you to tears. Its not a nice prospect to face having what may have been a whole lifetime of delusion to be shattered in the space of 5-10 minutes. So please be brave, let the facts do the talking, and when it "clicks", don't be afraid to stand up and say, "<i>I admit I have a problem! My terminology, language and phraseology in creed is primarily that of the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves and not of that which the Messengers came with</i>" - this is the biggest hurdle you have to get over, and once you've got passed "<b>the denial</b>" stage and put it behind you, its basically all downhill from there. Also don't worry, we are there to help you every stage of the way. You are not alone - and we guarantee your privacy and anonymity at all times.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Facing the Facts Part 1: Aristotle's "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar"</font>    <P>
Dear participant, something you should be familiar with if you have been a regular visitor to our site, or if you recently joined <a href=categories/the-clinic.html>our clinic</a>, is Aristotle's ten categories, which famously became known as "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar". This was a classification to help characterize everything in the observable universe. This <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> and philosophy was current in the Muslim lands in the early part of Islaam, and there were found many atheists and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that were conversant and learned in this regard. As for these Ten Categories:    <P>
The first deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol>    <P>
This philosophy and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> was current amongst the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who were present in the Muslim lands in the early period of Islam. And it was upon these classifications and terminologies that <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> after him, pioneered a proof to demonstrate the universe is created and that it must have a creator. Subsequently, in describing this creator (to those atheists) they were forced to stick to the same language and terminology in describing Allaah that they had used to argue for the existence of the creator, and this forced them to start rejecting much of what is in the Book and the Sunnah. They, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, were the pioneers of many of the false ta'weels and tahreefs (distortions) of the revealed texts that got passed through to the later <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the later Asha'ris and Maturidis).    <P>
When they wrongly considered this rational demonstration of the createdness of the universe (and hence the existence of a Maker), to be the ultimate truth, they then started to deny for Allaah what was stated in the revealed texts and what they presumed and believed to fall into the categories of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, such as quality, and quantity, and place, and relation and action and so on. So the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> denied everything. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> affirmed the Names but not any of the attributes.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>It is important to point out here that while the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> used some of these basic notions, ideas, language and classifications of these atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in their theological discourse on the creator and the manner of speech regarding Him, they did not concur with the actual views of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, such as the belief in an eternal universe, and nor with the entirety of the philosophies of these people.</div>    <P>
Whilst there was also the Platonic philosophy of matter and form (al-maaddah was-soorah) in characterizing the universe, in addition to the Aristotelian <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and incidental attribute (al-jawhar wal-'arad), it was the latter that served the purpose of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and which became integral to their version of Tawheed that was fundamentally tied to their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". Further, if we leave the Emanation doctrine of Plotinus (d. 270CE), another Greek Philosopher, to one side, and look at the essence of his doctrine regarding what he called "the One":    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Plotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent "One", containing no division, multiplicity or distinction; likewise it is beyond all categories of being and non-being. The concept of "being" is derived by us from the objects of human experience called the dyad, and is an attribute of such objects, but the infinite, transcendent One is beyond all such objects, and therefore is beyond the concepts that we derive from them.</blockquote>    <P>
...then you - dear participant - should start to recognize the true source of much of the <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> that you have been suffering from and which is in truth behind <u>much of your speech</u> in what you say about your Lord. These were some of the philosophies that were present in the Arab lands, and unfortunately, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> thought they could down bottles of this stuff and still remain sober. It wasn't the case, they got intoxicated and whilst they found a (false, corrupt) way to prove Allaah's existence through this <a href='tags/liquor.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Liquor</font></a>, when they tried to speak about their Lord, alas, they could not free themselves from that <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a>.      <P>
<b>And therefore Tawheed became nothing but negating from Allaah, <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), and <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), and <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (incidental attribute), and divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) and multiplicity (ta'addud) and distinction (imtiyaaz) and place  and location (makaan), and direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>) and space occupation (tahayyuz) and so on. And anything in the revealed texts that hinted at any opposition to this type of Tawheed (the Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad) was either rejected (hey, that's just an aahaad hadeeth) or made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of, if the text could not be rejected (like the verses of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or mutawaatir ahaadeeth).</b>    <P>
If this is hard upon you and you are feeling a little vulnerable and sensitive right now, please hold on and remain with us for the full session. You just need to battle those emotions and believe us, you will come out a better person at the end of this. To ease things a little, we'll take a small interlude.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Small Break:</b> We encourage participants to speak to each other during this break and not to be shy or fearful in  making an admission about the true and real source of the language that determines their creed. There's nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Being frank and honest with your own soul is always the best policy.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Facing the Facts Part 2: The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Were the Pioneers of the Intellectual Proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</font>    <P>
As for <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) we have covered that in a separate article so please <a href=index7863.html?upfkv>refer to it here</a>. Basically he was the first to devise a crude form of what became known as the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" or "hudooth ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam" and he argued against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, that the presence of qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and events, occurrences (hawaadith, meaning actions) in bodies prove that they are created and therefore must have a creator.     <P>
It was on this basis that he in turn rejected that Allaah could be described with anything at all, trying to make Allaah totally unlike the bodies (ajsaam) that make up the universe, and upon this basis he denied that Allaah spoke to Moses as this would be considered an event, occurrence, that would render Allaah a body, (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). Or that Allaah took Abraham as His khaleel, intimate friend as this would be considered an event, occurrence (haadithah) and also affection (infi'aal) which is from Aristotle's Maqoolaat. And that Allaah is not above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (following al-Ja'd bin Dirham in that) because aboveness, considered an incidental attribute, necessitates makaan (location) and <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (that something is a body). And that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created because if it was Allaah's Speech then as it is comprised of statements which are all other than each other, then it would mean all of these are events, occurrences (hawaadith), meaning actions of Allaah, and this would prove, in accordance with Aristotle's Maqoolaat, that Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). So Jahm and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> wallowed in this until they described Allaah with what amounted to nothingness - fearing that they might liken Him with the created bodies (ajsaam). This is why the Salaf, like <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others said about Jahm and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that they wish to describe Allaah is if He is "laa shay" (nothing). The reason why they did this was to avoid likening Allaah to anything in the creation, because everything in the creation is, upon the Maqoolaat, either jawaahir (substances, bodies) and the incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) that are found in them, and just by merely affirming an attribute for Allaah, then as that attribute is also found in the creation, then you have likened Allaah to the creation. This was the reasoning of those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.    <P>
The debates of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> are well-documented and mentioned in the early books of aqidah, and there are plenty of narrations from the Salaf in this regard that mention how Jahm became confused as a result of these debates he was having with these atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, then they too were involved in debates with the atheists and amongst them, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>. They took the proof of <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a> and used it just like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, though they made some improvements and refinments to it, most noticeable the incorporation of "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" (the indivisible particle). This was done to simplify the proof and make it more elegant and make it more easier to argue for the createdness of the entire universe (we can cover this in detail in separate articles).  The first to document it and formalize this for the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> was <b><a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a></b> (d. 235H).      <P>
Here is part of the contents from the book "Sharh Usool il-Khamsah" of <b>al-Qaadee Abdul-Jabbaar</b> (d. 415H), the Mu'tazili, (<a href=assets/images/qaadee-abdul-jabbar-usool-khamsah-cover.gif>you can view the book cover here</a>):      <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-qadijabbar-jawhar-arad.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We can see here that al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar outlines the proof of "hudooth ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam", which is the demonstration of the createdness of bodies (ajsaam) on account of the presence of incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) found within them, amongst which is a subset called akwaan - states of being, a) motion (harakah) and rest (sukoon) and b) combination (ijtimaa'), separation (iftiraaq).    <P>
To summarize what you see above in the contents:    <P>
<blockquote>Using <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> as a means to prove Allaah's existence; affirming the existence of incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) in bodies; affirming incidental attributes are emergent, occurring; affirming the akwaan (states of being) are emergent, occurring in bodies; affirming that bodies are not devoid of akwaan and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and that this proves they themselves are occurring, emergent; and as bodies are emergent, they must have an originator.</blockquote>    <P>
Now the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took the crude form used by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) and refined it somewhat, and they also introduced the idea of "<a href="tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>" or "al-juz' alladhee laa yatajazza'" which is the indivisible particle, into this proof to make it easier to argue for the createdness of the entire universe. We will not go into that in too much detail in this session to avoid complicating things.     <P>
And here on page 96, <b>al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbaar</b> (d. 415H) is speaking about the ways of establishing the createdness of the universe to prove Allaah's existence, having mentioned two already connected to ajsaam (bodies) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (their incidental attributes), he then says:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qaadee-abdul-jabbar-usool-khamsah-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the third angle, and this is the evidence that is depended upon, <b>and the first one to seek evidence through it was Abu al-Hudhayl [al-Allaaf, d. 235H]</b>, and the other Shuyook [of the Mu'tazilah] followed him in that.</blockquote>    <P>
So he affirms here that al-Allaaf was the first to formalize this for the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. And then he summarizes it, saying, (and whatever is in square brackets are explanatory additions by us):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>That bodies (ajsaam) are not devoid of occurrences (hawaadith), and they never precede them, and whatever is not free of something new arising within it (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>) by having preceded it, it is necessary that it [too] is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (newly-arisen, created).    <P>
And this evidence is based upon four presumed claims:    <P>
<ul><li> The first: That within bodies there are four meanings, and they are: combination (ijtimaa), separation (iftiraaq), motion (harakah) and rest (sukoon) [these are referred to as akwaan, states of being].  <li> The second: That these meanings are newly-arisen (muhdathah) [meaning exist after having not existed]  <li> The third: That the body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) is never devoid of them [meaning the newly-arisen occurrences, which are the four akwaan]  <li> And the fourth: That since [they body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)] is never devoid of them, and nor does it precede them, then it is binding that it is newly-arisen (i.e. created) just like them [the four akwaan].</ul></blockquote>    <P>
So this should now be very clear and we see that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon this, they were the pioneers, and they were intoxicated by the Maqoolaat, and all of this formed the basis of their "<u>intellectual proof</u>" and in turn the entirety of their speech regarding Tawheed was forced to remain within the confines of this same language, and to avoid invalidating this proof, which they were deluded into thinking was the ultimate truth, they rejected whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself in the revealed texts if it clashed with the necessities of this intellectual proof they devised.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Facing the Facts Part 3: The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> Remained Upon This Same Proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> are the followers of <b>Abdullah bin Sa'eed Ibn Kullaab</b> (d. 240H), and whilst they showed rejection against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they tried to tread a middle ground between Ahl us-Sunnah and these Innovators. However, because in the course of their argumentation with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they wrongly assumed the correctness of some of the underlying usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and whilst also holding onto this proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and considering it to be valid, they denied Allaah could be described with actions tied to His will and power (<u>sifaat fi'liyyah, or af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah</u>). And essentially the bulk of the Kullaabi creed was to affirm most of what Ahl us-Sunnah affirmed with the exception of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>. This creed was taken up by Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (d. 324H) and he used to mix with the Kullaabis and attend their gatherings whilst in Baghdad.    <P>
It is important to note that Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> did not allow the use of this proof and considered it an innovation (after leaving the Mu'tazilah). However, al-Baqillani (d. 403H), in his formalization of what became known as the Ash'arite creed through his books "at-Tamheed" and "al-Insaaf", <u>brought many things from himself and which were not from al-Ash'ari</u>, and they became part of what became known as the Ash'arite creed.     <P>
We can now take a look at some standard Ash'arite textbooks, the first of which is "at-Tamheed" of <b>al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani</b> (d. 403H) - the most important book in the formulation and formalization of what became known as the Ash'arite creed. <a href=assets/images/baqillani-sifaat-tamheed.gif>You can see its cover here.</a>. We see that they made the foundation of their religion upon this same intellectual proof and they just took it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, inclusive of the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> incorporated into the proof to refine and improve it:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-baqillani-jawhar-arad.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
On page 37 we see the introduction of the Aristotelian classification of what is in the universe into <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) or what is more formally referred to as "<a href="tags/accident.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">accident</font></a>". Then he goes on to explain this for a short while.    <P>
Then we can move to the contents page and just look at the use of the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" again, meaning the presence of incidental attributes in bodies as proof of their being occurrences in and of themselves (hawaadith) and thus requiring and originator (muhdith).    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-baqillani-jawhar-arad-2.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In these contents pages, we see the following:    <P>
<blockquote>The categories of created things (meaning, substances and incidental attributes that make up the universe); speech regarding incidental attributes; affirming the incidental attributes; affirming the emergent nature of the universe; affirming the Maker (through what has preceded).</blockquote>    <P>
And we can quote an actual passage here for the sake of completion. Al-Baqillani writes in his "at-Tamheed", (pp. 41-43):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/al-baqillani-tamheed-hudooth-ul-ajsaam.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: Speech Regarding Affirmation of the Emergence of the Universe</b>    <P>
All of the universe, its high and its low, does not exit from [being] one of these two types, I mean, substances (al-jawaahir, meaning particles) and incidental attributes (al-a'raad), and in its entirety, it is newly-arisen (i.e. created), and the evidence for its emergence is what we have [previously] covered regarding the affirmation of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes found in bodies).    <P>
And the incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) are newly-arising occurrences (hawaadith), and the evidence for their emergence is the termination of motion (harakah) at the onset of rest (sukoon), because if (motion) was not terminated upon the onset of rest, then would have both been present in the body at the same time, and this would have necessitated that it is both moving and at rest at the same time, and this is from those things whose corruption (i.e. falsehood) is known by necessity.    <P>
And the evidence for the <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a> (bodies being newly-arisen, created) is that they do not precede the occurrences (hawaadith, meaning motion and rest), and are not found prior to them, and whatever does not precede that which is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (newly-occurring, created), then it is also mudhath just like it, since it will not be devoid of the [hawaadith] being present alongside it (its existence), or after its (existence), and both situations necessiate that it is newly-arisen itself.    <P>
And the proof that the body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) is not permitted to preceded the hawaadith (occurrences, meaning motion and rest, or combination and separation), is that we know by necessity that when it is present, then either is (individual) parts (i.e. the particles that constitute it) are touching and combined, or are distinct and separate. This is because there is no third situation between them being in contact or being separate, thus it is necessary that it cannot be correct for them to precede the occurrences (hawaadith, i.e.combination and separation) themselves. And whatever does not precede the newly-arisen occurrences, it is necessary that it itself is newly-arisen, since, when it is the case that the (body) is only present alongside the presence of these [occurrences] or after them, then whichever of the two affairs is established, it is necessary to judge by it for the createdness of bodies.</blockquote>    <P>
Al-Baqillani is simply following on with what was pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - as did all the Ash'aris,  although Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself, after abandoning the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, declared this method to be an innovation and prohibited its use, though he erroneously considered it to be a valid proof nevertheless - and it was on account of this proof that they were forced to negate, to varying degrees, what Allaah described Himself with. Thus, their speech about Allaah became based entirely around Aristotle's Maqoolaat, negating from Allaah <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (being a body) and the incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and events (hawaadith) of bodies. So when you speak to an Ash'arite, or read their writings, you will now understand the true nature of their speech.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Oops, hold on!</b> One of our participants has just had enough and stormed out, <u>he's from Malabar in India</u>, and its just got too much for him to handle. We are going to have to take another short break here! He previously paid a visit to our clinic (<a href=index2199.html?cqcvp>see here</a>), and he didn't take that too well either as we had to straight-jacket him!    <P>
<b>Small Break:</b> Whilst we console him and try to bring him back, we encourage participants to have the courage to start coming clean and to start making the admission of guilt. If you are thinking it in  your mind, then pluck up the courage to turn to the person on your right and to express it clearly in words. Go ahead, just say it, "<i>Hey buddy, I'm coming out of the closet, my mind, my thinking and my speech is actually intoxicated, and I now admit and acknowledge that there is a problem, my entire speech about Allaah, in affirmation and negation is based around the Maqoolaat of Aristotle!</i>". You will feel <u>an enormous amount of relief and tension</u> when you face the reality, face the facts and say it openly. As we said, this is a new beginning!  </div>    <P>
We can resume now ... next we take a look at the book al-Irshaad of <b>Abu al-Mu'aalee al-Juwaynee</b> (d. 478H), otherwise known as Imaam ul-Haramayn, and he is another prominent figure in the Ash'arite madhhab. This is what we find on pages 17-18 (and the section runs through until page 21):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-juwaynee-jawhar-arad.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We don't need to translate all this, we can just put the essence of it which is:    <P>
<blockquote>The universe is made up of jawaahir and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, with a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> being a space-occupying object which has "bulk" (i.e. dimension). Then demonstrating that because these substances have incidental attributes (a'raad, akwaan) and are not devoid of them or do not precede them, then it proves they are also occurrences (hawaadith), and following on from that the universe is an occurrence (hadath).  </blockquote>    <P>
So we see that the <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> of Jahm and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> has gone a long way, and that the root and source of these people (the Mutakallimoon) is the one and the same.    <P>
Next up is <b>Abdul-Qadir al-Baghdadi</b> (d. 429H) and his book "Usool ud-Din". We see this on page 33 where he outlines his treatment of the "hudooth ul-aalam" (occurrence of the universe) and the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" over 30 or so pages:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-baghdadi-jawhar-arad-list.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Here we just have a list of the various issues he is going to discuss whilst covering the intellectual proof of <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>, and here on page 58-59, where after bringing a section heading titled, "<i>The eleventh matter from the second foundation in establishing <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> ul-ajsaam</i>", he says a little further down:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-workshop1-baghdadi-jawhar-arad.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Over the 30 pages in which this topic is covered, we see the same thing mentioned by <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) and al-Baqillani (d. 403H). That the universe is made up of jawaahir and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and the that the incidental attributes found in the bodies are proof that the bodies themselves are occurrences, events (hawaadith), and this proves that the universe is also an occurrence, and must have an originator who is eternal. This is the essence of what he has covered here, leaving out some of the subsidiary details he discusses.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Self-Awareness Group Session:</b> We are going to break now for a group session. Participants should work in groups of three to four to make discussions whose objectives should be:    <P>
<ul><li>To trace the foundations of the speech of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (speculative <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) to the Maqoolaat of Aristotle    <P>
<li> To reflect upon their past instances of "<u>speaking creed under the influence</u>" and see how it correlates with what is above    <P>
<li> To encourage each member of the group discussion - if they have not already done so - to make that verbal admission of "being under the influence" and to come out of the closet.  </ul>    <P>
To encourage discussion, this diagram should assist participants:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/mutakallimoon-names-attributes-chart.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
This group discussion should last for 20-30 minutes.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Tightening the Ship</font>    <P>
At this point it is important to point out that some of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> were quite smart and they figured out that the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" is flawed, and realizing that if this proof was criticized and invalidated, it would have serious consequences upon their school, it would undermine everything, so what they started doing was to devise and incorporate other proofs or aspects of them into their theology, so that if "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" was shown to false, it would not harm them. When you look at the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> such as al-Eejee (d. 756H), and al-Aamidee (d. 631H) you see that they incorporate other notions into the basic idea of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", such as at-takhsees (argument through particularization) and "imkaan and wujoob" (argument through necessary and possible existence) which were not found in the earlier foundational books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, or at least not made the base and foundation as "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" was. So they ended up creating a type of hybrid between <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a></i> to seal up this flaw, and prevent themselves from being subject to attack. And this is the  nature of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, it leads a person wandering astray into every valley.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> had already noticed a flaw in the argument of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" which allowed them to bolster and strengthen their claim of an eternal universe. However, we will leave that for another article to avoid digressing.</div>    <P>
It's time to bring this workshop to a close now, its been intense for a lot of the participants, and some are close to tears.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Escaping Delusion Through Positive Affirmations</font>    <P>
We would like participants to take these positive affirmation cards we have created. They should prove  extremely useful in  escaping from the delusion that victims and sufferers find hard to shake off, after years, if not a lifetime, of abuse. We suggest you take these cards and pin them on your refrigerator, bathroom, the inside of your wardrobe, and keep them by the side of your bed. Expressing positive affirmations out aloud are a good way to change your core beliefs about reality and alter your perceptions.    <P>
Here they are:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-2.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-3.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-4.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-5.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>

<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-7.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aa-affirmations-8.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Do feel free to make up your own "positive affirmations", they can be a powerful way to eradicate worn-out, old ways of thinking and replace them with new neural patterns that will provide an altered way of perceiving, allowing the escape from delusion. It really is "all in the mind".    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Close of Workshop</font>    <P>
The workshop has now come to an end, thank you for participating! If you would like additional support, do not hesitate to <a href=contact.html>contact us</a>. If you are a third-party observer and know victims and sufferers please do tell them about the AA, and about these workshops. Details of the next workshop will be announced shortly.    <P>
