<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Term 'al-Jism'</font>    <P>
The first then is al-jism (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1587;&#1605;</span>), and this is used in negation or affirmation for Allaah by the Ahl al-Kalaam. Ahl al-Sunnah do not use this word. There are numerous meanings for it:    <P>
<ol><li> Indicating the meaning of <u><i>thickness, density</i> associated with an entity</u> on account of which it is called "jism." Hence, things like air, water, fire are not called "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>". This is the established known meaning in the language of the Arabs.    <P>
<li> That which is <u>composed</u> of <u>matter and form</u> (<i>al-maadah wal-surah</i>) - this is the saying of those influenced by the Platonic philosopheFrs    <P>
<li> That which is <u>composed of indivisible particles (al-jawaahir al-fardah)</u> - this is also from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> - and it is the saying of most of Ahl al-Kalaam, then they differ, is it two particles, three, six, eighteen, thirty-six? These are all views amongst them. What their definitions are all geared towards is establishing spatial extension. Hence, some say only two particles are required on account of which spatial extension is established. Others say six, to established spatial extension in three directions. These bodies are never devoid of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes), and the term <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>  will be looked at separately. This definition is the foundation for Ahl al-Kalaam in rejecting His names, attributes and actions (upon the differences between them).    <P>
<li> That which is <i><u>al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi</u></i> (self-established) and is described with attributes. This is the definition of some of the Ahl al-Kalaam, in particular, those who went to <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, like the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and also the Raafidee Mutakallims.    <P>
<li> That which can be <u>seen</u> and <u>pointed at</u> (as in exists with a real existence).  </ol>    <P>
In light of the above we say:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Allah is free of being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> with its pure, original Arabic language. Likewise He is free of the <u>second</u> and <u>third</u> definitions for <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>. As for the <u>fourth</u>, then the meaning is correct, and it is not permissible to deny it, rather it is falsehood to deny it, but the wording is not applied to Allah. Those who applied it, even with this correct meaning, were referred to historically as  <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and they are the brethren of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah in Ahl al-Kalaam. The same is said about the <u>fifth</u>, Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter with the vision of the eyes and He can be pointed at, as is established in the Sunnah. However, the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> is not to be used. The Innovators also use an associated term "<u><a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a></u>" in this regard to deceive the people and that will be covered separately.</blockquote></div>    <P>
The negation of "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" was first done by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to deny all attributes for Allah and to deny His 'uluww and to deny He will be seen in the Hereafter, or that He speaks with speech that can be heard. Then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah have their share in some of this too, since they inherited the greatest principle of al-Jahm bin Safwaan as indicated in <a href=indexdfc8.html?ohltj>the introduction</a>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Additional Notes</font>    <P>
We have indicated in other articles that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> acknowledge that the definition of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> (their brethren in ilm al-kalaam and in the Jahmee principle "<i>Whatever is not devoid  of hawaadith is itself haadith</i>") is acceptable and that the difference is only one of wording. You can refer to those quotations from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> books in this article:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>Jism, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphists</font></a>)</b>: In the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Textbooks and in the Works of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah: A Brief Comparison - (<a href=index264c.html?bolnh>see here</a>)  </ul></div>    <P>
These are some of the quotes in that article:    <P>
From al-Eejee in his <i>al-Mawaqif</i>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...So the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, that is, some of them, said, "He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), meaning, existent (mawjood)". And (another) people amongst them said, "He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), meaning established by Himself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi)". <b>So there is no dispute with them upon [either] of these two explanations except in the naming, meaning in the application of the word "al-jism" to Him</b>. </blockquote>    <P>
And from <i>Sullam ul-Wusool</i> of al-Mutee'i:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...As for the one who said, "He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) but not like the [created] bodies", then he has negated [from Him] the necessities (lawaazim) of the [created] bodies, such that nothing remains from them [in relation to Allaah] except the mere naming [with al-jism]. <b>So this, as our Shaykh has said, there is no angle for any differing in this, because nothing remains except merely naming Him with [the word] al-jism (body)</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
And from <i>Sharh ul-Aqaa'id al-Adhudiyyah</i> of al-Dawwaaniyy:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And in this manner does such a one negate from Him all of the special [qualities] of a [created] body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) <b>until nothing remains except the mere label (ism) of a al-jism</b>. And these [people] are not declared disbelievers, as opposed to those who are explicit in affirming <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (i.e. a body like the created bodies).</blockquote>    <P>
Also, the following quote was brought to our attention (<u>Acknowledgement:</u> Abu Turab Ali Rida, may Allah reward him), and it is from the Hanafi <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar, Abu Ja'far al-Simnani (d. 444H), and is cited by <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> in al-Siyar (17:540), who in turn is citing from Ibn Hazm (d. 456H):    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[Ibn Hazm]: He is Abu Ja'far al-Simnani al-Makfuf, he is the greatest of the companions of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a>, and the forerunner of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in his time. And from his statements are:    <P>
<blockquote>Whoever labelled Allaah a "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" for the purpose (of explaining) that He has attributes in His essence, then he is correct in the meaning, but has erred in the labelling (tasmiyah) only."</blockquote>    <P>
Then Ibn Hazm began pouring scorn upon al-Simnani and mentioned about him that He permitted riddah (apostasy) upon the Messenger after fulfilment of the risaalah (message) [ed. as in it is possible, plausible, permissible for the Messenger to apostatize after fulfilling the message], we seek refuge in Allaah from  misguidance.</blockquote>    <P>
So all of these quotes show that were factions labelled as "<a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a>" who were <u>factions amongst the Karraamiyyah</u> with whom the dispute was one of <u>wording only</u>. As for the quote of <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> from Ibn Hazm, the original occurs in <i>al-Fisal Fi al-Milal</i> (Dar al-Jayl, Beirut, 1996, 5/77-78), wherein he is recounting the disgraces of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of his time.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Further, some of the leading Imaams of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, like Ibn al-Haysam, denied that they make tasbhih like that of the Raafidah when they affirm the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah and that they affirm them upon the way of the Imaams of the Sunnah (<a href=index7b43.html?fenha>see this article</a>). So these types of <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> were actually closer to the Sunnah, since they were free of the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of their brethren in ilm al-kalaam, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Later <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. As for their position on "hawaadith" (as in Allaah acquiring attributes after not having them), we will deal with their position in the part where we deal with this term and its meaning.</div> <P>
