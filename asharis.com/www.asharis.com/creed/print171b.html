<p>All praise is due to Allaah, may prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have recently attempted to argue for their creed that the Qur'aan is created (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv >a view they conceal in private - but dare not reveal in public</a>) - however they have tried to cause some confusion by playing around with the words "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>", "haadith", "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" and bringing some narrations from the Salaf which they have wrongly thought are for them when they are in fact a summary judgment against them and their disbelief - for the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were always a dumb and disgraced people, with little understanding. So inshaa'Allaah we are going to deal with some of their shubuhaat (doubts) that they have brought in order to argue for the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created - whilst making an open display of piety and righteousness with the claim of following the way of the Salaf.    <P>
We will bring many articles on this subject as it is a detailed and sometimes complicated issue, and it is for this reason the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are able to cause confusion. However, the Salaf were wise to them, knew their rat-holes and their secret hideouts, and were able to clean them out, often with a single sweep of the pen.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>See what the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> Teach in Secret But Forbid That It Be Said in Open: From al-Bayjoori's Sharh Jawharat ut-Tawheed - "We can say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created when teaching in private, but not openly..." </b>- <a href=index7636.html?ajlfv >Read the article here</a>.</div>    <P>
So from those statements of the Salaf that expose these opportune people trying to be clever in the 21st century, is the saying of <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, who over 1100 years ago supplicated against them, for their humiliation, for them to be cursed, exposed and disgraced - and indeed this has been and is their legacy walillaahil-hamd.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Before we come to the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-jareer-at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jareer <a href="tags/at-tabari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Tabari</font></a></font></a> (d. 310) then Ahl us-Sunnah in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari Heretics, affirm that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, and from them is <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> oppose this because affirming speech tied to Allaah's will is kufr according to them, because it amounts to "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>", and it amounts to Allaah being considered a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), subject to events (hawaadith). And it is for this reason that the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a great one and one by which the Ummah was put to trial. And the originator of this was <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (ex. 128H) and he innovated many beliefs in order to protect his proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" which is actually the base and foundation of all of the Mutakallimeen (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) and thus they all harbour the same <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (to varying degrees) trying to hide the fact that their usool all derive from the same source with a show of smoke of mirrors.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d. 310H) Cleaning Out the Secret Hideouts of the <a href="tags/jahmite-asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a></font>    <P>
We have a lot more to say on this issue, for indeed there is in the speech of the Salaf what exposes these Ash'aris as none other than the tail-ends of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites, and who are nothing but plagiarizers of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> al-Qattaan al-Basri (d. 240H). For now, lets leave it to Ibn Jareer (rahimahullaah), through al-Laalikaa'ee (1/206-207):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/at-tabari-quran-creed.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The Creed of Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Jareer at-Tabari</b>    <P>
Ubaydullaah bin Muhammad bin Ahmad informed us - reading to him - he said: Al-Qaadee Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Kaamil informed us, saying: Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Jareer said:    <P>
The first of that which we begin with regarding that is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and His Revelation, since they are from the meanings of His Tawheed.     <P>
So what is correct of the speech regarding that, in our view, is that it is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is not created in whichever manner it may be written or when it is recited, in whatever place it may be recited, whether it is found in the heaven or upon the earth, however it may be preserved - whether written in the Lawh il-Mahfoodh (the Preserved Tablet) or in the copies of the children of the Qur'anic schools, or inscribed on a stone and written on paper or leaf,  whether memorized in the heart, or spoken by the tongue.     <P>
<b>Whoever says other than this, or claims there is a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in the earth or in the heaven other than the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that which we recite with our tongues, and which we write in the masaahif (copies of the Qur'an), or who believes this in his heart or who conceals such a belief in his heart, or who professes it with his tongue, t<u>hen he is a kaafir</u> whose blood and wealth is lawful </b>and who is free from Allaah and Allaah is free from him - due to the saying of Allaah, lofty be His praise:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Nay! This is a Glorious <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (Inscribed) in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet)!  (Al-Buruj 85:21-22) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And He said, and His saying is the truth:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And if anyone of the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an)..  (At-Tawbah 9:6) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So He informed us, lofty be His praise that it is in the Preserved Tablet, written, and that it is heard from the tongue of the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) <u>and it is a single Qur'aan, heard from Muhammad and written in the Preserved Tablet, and likewise, memorized in the hearts, and recited upon the tongues of the shuyookh (old) and the children (young)</u>.    <P>
So whoever reports or quotes from us, or fabricates a saying against us, or claims against us that we say anything other than that, then upon him is the curse of Allaah and His Anger, and the curse of those who curse, [and the curse of] the Angels, and mankind, altogether. Allaah will not accept any effort or goodness from him, will expose and disgrace him in front of all of the witnesses on the day that the excuses of the oppressors will not benefit them, they will have the curse and they will have the evil abode.  </blockquote>    <P>
At-Tabari, walillaahil-hamd has cleaned out the rat-holes of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> with these concise words, may Allah have mercy upon him - and inshaa'Allaah we will be developing this issue in more detail in order to address a lot of the doubts that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are spreading these days, including the issue of "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>" and "haadith" that they are bringing - for all of those narrations they are bringing are actually in refutation and takfeer of them and not in relation to those who affirm Allaah has actions tied to His will and power - indeed the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are a disgraced, humiliated, forsaken people, as they always were - and this is why they wander blindly in the valleys and pits, thinking they are upon guidance, blind to it. <P>
