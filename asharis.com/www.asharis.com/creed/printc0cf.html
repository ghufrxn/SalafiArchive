<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
From the well-known sayings of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> is that:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah is not within the creation, nor outside of it, and not attached, connected to the creation nor separate from it. And He is not above the creation nor below it. He is not to the right of the creation nor to its left. And not in front of the creation and nor behind it.</blockquote>    <P>
This saying is from the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and it is not the saying of the followers of the revealed texts. Unlike those who speak with this repugnant philosophical <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a>, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> affirmed that Allaah Himself, is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (<a href=index267b.html?cgolk>see here</a>) as did the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (<a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>see here</a>) - and also <a href=index24b1.html?ddxry>see this article</a>. The abovementioned saying is synonymous with the words used by the Salaf to characterize the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, that "there is no Lord above the heaven and no deity above the Throne" (Go to <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>AboveTheThrone.com</a> to see examples from the sayings of the Salaf in this regard).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>This Saying of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> is Taken from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
The saying of these <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> has its origins in the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that <u>Allaah is in every place</u>. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> began to say this after Jahm bin Safwan's debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> (Indian Materialist Philosophers), and his concoction of a creed regarding His Lord in which <u>he tried to redress their arguments against him</u>, which had confused him. So he said, in essence that Allaah is in every place, but without being perceived by any of the senses. When the hujjah (proof) was established against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on this issue from the revealed texts by Ahl us-Sunnah, they could not argue against it, and then began to say:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah is neither touching (mumaass) anything  nor separate (mubaayin) from anything.</blockquote>    <P>
And it is from here that the saying, "<u>Allaah is neither within the creation nor outside of it</u>" is derived and extended from.  And what they mean is that Allaah cannot be said to be "in things" or "outside of things" because these properties do not apply to Him as He is unlike created bodies (ajsaam). We have a separate article on this inshaa'Allaah where their great fraud regarding this subject and their speech regarding "false dichotomies" will be addressed inshaa'Allaah. But the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were those who originated the saying of negating two opposites from Allaah when their fraud was made apparent in their saying, "Allaah is in every place". And this saying, "<i>Allaah is neither within the universe, nor outside of it</i>" is the very saying of today's <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who fraudulently ascribe themselves to Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, they inherited this from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
And amongst the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who spoke with this saying was <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) and he precedes the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> (from <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> onwards, d. 478H) who departed from what the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> were upon of affirming Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (<a href=index24b1.html?ddxry>see here</a>). <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) was declared a kafir by <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) for rejection of the bodily resurrection. However, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> was from the Baatini Qaraamitah who were kafirs already but they outwardly associated with Islam through Shi'ism, proclaiming love for Ahl ul-Bayt as a means to win credibility amongst Muslims - and then they entered their philosophy and heresy and fused it with the beliefs of Islam, but really intending to promote and give domination to their heretical beliefs, and the views of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> such as <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>.    <P>
In this article we want to highlight that despite what appear to be such serious differences, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (such as Ibn Sina) and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (amongst whom are the Ash'aris) have a lot in common - <u>on account of what they made to be the foundation of their speech regarding the affairs of divinity</u> - the concepts, language and terminology inherited from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Quick Background on the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (Falaasifah and Mutafalsifah) and the Speculative <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (<a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>)</font>    <P>
Before proceeding with this article it's good to get a background to those who are referred to as the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and those who are referred to as the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>. To understand this is actually essential to understanding many of the affairs of aqeedah, and to get a real and true grasp of these issues of aqeedah you have to have this framework in  your mind - we mean here the various "players" in the field so to speak, so be sure to read the following first.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Understanding the Battle Between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (Aristotle, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, al-Farabi) and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah)</b> See here:   <a href=index61e3.html?ledrs>http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ledrs</a></div>    <P>
<b>The Philosophers</b>: <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (d. 332BC) is known as "<u>the First Teacher</u>". Abu Nasr al-Farabi (d. 339H) is known as "<u>the Second Teacher</u>". <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) is known as "<u>the Third Teacher</u>" - these are the actual titles given to them. The latter two are the inheritors of that Greek Philosophy of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (and Plato), and they championed it and their own beliefs through it. One of their main beliefs was that the "matter" that makes up the universe is eternal and has always been present and another being their rejection of bodily resurrection and the affairs connected to resurrection, and a third being that the Prophets were just <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who told lies to the people which they believed to be in the best interests of the people (to make them lead moral lives) and that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> too can reach this station of prophethood.    <P>
<b>The Mutakallimoon</b>: Are those who used the notions and underlying terminology of metaphysical philosophy (of those atheists and disbelievers such as Aristotle) to argue the case for:     <P>
<ul> <li> the universe being created,   <li> the existence of a creator,   <li> the plausibility of prophethood and   <li> the plausibility of resurrection.</ul>    <P>
And they are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah. And they made this proof of theirs to be the "ultimate truth" and the premise they were working on was that the truth of Islam can only be demonstrated through this proof - and in this, they were trying to impress upon those atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
So the battle was between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, but the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> were foolish for entering this battle by agreeing to use the language, terminology, and classifications of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (al-jawhar wal-'arad, al-maqoolaat al-ashar) and incorporating new ideas along the way (al-jawhar wal-fard), and by doing so, they could not let go of this "ilm ul-kalaam" and it in turn became their criterion over and above the revealed texts, and this reflected in their positions in creed that they formulated to keep in line with this "ilm ul-kalaam".    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Sina (d. 429H), <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a>, Allaah Not Being Within the Creation or Outside of it - The Saying of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> Inherited by the Later (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris</font>    <P>
This particular passage is quoted by Ibn al-Qayyim in his "as-Sawaa'iq al-Mursalah" and it is taken from a book by Ibn Seenaa called "ar-Risaalah al-Adhawiyyah Fee Amr il-Ma'aad", which is a book related to the issue of resurrection. And this book has been published numerous times with two verifications, that of Dr. Sulaymaan Danyaat, published by Dar al-Fikr al-Arabi, in Cairo, and that of Hasan Aamee, published in Beirut. We have not been able to acquire the original, otherwise we would have placed an image of the scan in this article.    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim is quoting this passage here to show how the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and other mulhids used what the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) were doing to the texts of the attributes as a green light and  justification for doing the same to the texts of creation and resurrection. And in this passage, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> is actually outlining his argument and justification of this. Now the passage is longer than this, but we are only interested in the first part of it, as it relates to our objective in this article. We could perhaps discuss the entirety of it in a separate article.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In short what <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> is saying is that as the texts of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> contain what amounts to <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> as it relates to Allaah and His Attributes, and as the truth clearly can't be in this, it is all just metaphor with the real truth being in what is necessitated by the language of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> (al-maqoolaat al-ashar) - then if this is case with the most important fundamental element of belief (in Allaah), <u>then it clearly must also be the case for what follows on from it, of the affairs of resurrection of the dead and so on</u>!     <P>
Now, though <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> made takfeer of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> on this issue, looking at the broader situation, the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> justified what they were doing to the texts relating to the resurrection through what the likes of Ghazali's predecessors were doing to the texts of the Attributes. If the texts of the Attributes were just metaphors and figurative speech that were necessary in order to get those "dumb, ignorant commoners" to believe (as <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> implies in his "Iljaam ul-Awaam" - <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>) - and this is in relation to the most important aspect of creed, namely, belief in Allaah, then how can it not be the case for something that follows on from belief in Allaah and is less than that? Meaning, the resurrection. So <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> justified what they were doing to the texts of the resurrection, through the actions of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>.    <P>
This is a subject on its own and inshaa'Allaah we will develop it further in a separate article.</div>    <P>
Here we are focusing just on the part to do with the language of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> and the belief of the later (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris that <i>"Allaah is neither within the creation, nor outside of it</i>".    <P>
Here is the text as quoted by Ibn al-Qayyim:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-seenaa-quote-risaalah-adhawiyyah.gif border=0>    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim first says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So those [Atheist] Heretics argue against the deniers of the Attributes through what they have agreed with them upon of turning away from the texts of revelation and negation of the Attributes, as has been mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> in his treatise "al-Adhawiyyah". For he said therein, when he mentioned the proof of those who affirm the resurrection of the body, and that the reason [that invites] them to that [belief] is what has been mentioned in the legislation of the resurrection of the dead.</blockquote>    <P>
Then he quotes Ibn Sina:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the affair of the legislation (ash-shar'), then it is desirable that one principle be known regarding it, which is:    <P>
That the religion that came upon the tongue of a prophet amongst the Prophets, what is desired by it is to address all people, as a whole.    <P>
Then from what is known and clear is that the verification [of truth] that is desirable to be referred back to regarding the soundness of Tawheed  of [which is the] affirmation of a Maker [that is] unique (muwahhad) and sanctified (muqaddas) from:    <P>
<ul><li><u>al-kam</u> (quantity)  <li><u>al-kayf</u> (quality)  <li><u>al-ayn</u> (location, place)  <li><u>mataa</u> (time, when)  <li><u>al-wad'</u> (position)  <li><u>at-taghyeer</u> (change) [denoted by acting (fi'l) or being acted upon (infi'aal)]</ul>    <P>
so that belief in Him becomes [one in which] He is a single essence, it not being possible for it [the essence] to have a partner in type (naw') or that it has an existent part (juz') whether in terms of quantity or conceptually (in meaning).     <P>
And it is not possible that it [the essence] be outside of the universe (the creation) and nor inside of it, and nor that it would be correct to point to Him that He is "here" or "there".    <P>
And it is not possible to present this [belief] to the majority [of people]. And if it was presented in this form to the Arabs [of pure original Arabic tongue], or Hebrews [present in the Arab lands] they would have rushed to stubborn rejection (al-inaad), and <b>they would have been in agreement that [this] belief (eemaan) that is being called to is belief in a [mere] non-existent [thing] which has no existence fundamentally [at all]</b>...</blockquote>    <P>
After this, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> goes on to explain how there is a great deal of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in the Torah, and likewise there is found <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in the texts of the Book and the Sunnah, and on account of what he has already mentioned ]that the truth is really in how he has described Allaah, upon the <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> based language] then based upon this all these texts are just metaphors and not really intended. He then says, arguing that if this is the case (regarding belief in Allaah), "<i>Then how can the apparent [texts] of the legislation be considered proof</i>..." in the subject of the resurrection. So he has used the behaviour of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> towards the texts of the Attributes (they are metaphors and mutashaabihaat) and said that's how we behave with the texts mentioning resurrection of bodies.    <P>

<b><u>Point 1: Between <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) and the Ash'aris such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - Between the <a href='tags/falaasifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falaasifah</font></a> and the Mutakallimoon</u></b>    <P>
First you need to go and read this article regarding what has been said by <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> on a similar subject:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li><b>Abu Hamid <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (Imaam of the Ash'aris): If the Prophet Invited to Belief in Allaah Through the Language and Terminology of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, Not even One in a Thousand Would Accept It!

Al-Ghazali is trying to answer the objection that how come the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) did not use this type of language of the Aristotelian Metaphysicists (the Mutakallimoon) and say things like (quoting directly from al-Ghazali's words):    <P>
<ul><li>He exists, (but) is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>),   <li>and nor a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>),   <li>and nor an incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>),   <li>and nor is He inside the universe,   <li>nor outside of it,   <li>nor attached to it,   <li>nor separate from it,   <li>and He is not in a location (makaan),   <li>and nor is He in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>),   <li>rather all the directions are devoid of Him</ul>    <P>
And from al-Ghazali's response is that the Prophet (alayhis salaam) was forced to use metaphors, <u>firstly</u> because the Arabic language was incapable of carrying the subtlety of  meanings required to convey accurately the true belief in Allaah (meaning their Aristotelian metaphysical credo) and <u>secondly</u>, that if the Prophet (alayhis salaam) did do so, not one in a thousand people would accept it and the vast majority of them would tend to atheism!    <P>
And what is the reason why the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and these <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> concur on this issue? Yes, they made the knowledge of Tawheed to be dependent upon and bound by the classification, terminology and language of the atheist mulhid <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> such as <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, and since they all drink from the same fountain in reality, then their statements resemble each other.    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: Thanks <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> "the First Teacher" For Giving Us (<a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>) the Philosophy From Which We Derived the Underlying Foundations Without Which We Could Not Have Understood the True Tawheed And Thanks <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> "the Third Teacher" and Exceedingly Shrewd Kafir For Supporting Us</u></b>    <P>
As you can see in the quote above, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> has  mentioned the things that Allaah is sanctified of, and then he mentions what are from the Ten Categories of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar):    <P>
<ul><li><u>al-kam</u> (quantity)  <li><u>al-kayf</u> (quality)  <li><u>al-ayn</u> (location, place)  <li><u>mataa</u> (time, when)  <li><u>al-wad'</u> (position)  <li><u>at-taghyeer</u> (change) [denoted by acting (fi'l) or being acted upon (infi'aal)]</ul>    <P>
And in the same risaalah, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> makes mention of purifying Allaah of "tahayyuz" (space occupation) and "jihaat" directions - again this being the necessities of the Aristotelian categories mentioned above - and which are the foundation for the Ilm ul-Kalaam of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and their basic notions from which their "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" was derived.    <P>
And we see that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, who are supposed to be enemies of each, are actually united from the angle that they are all agreed that this knowledge, meaning this knowledge and philosophy, this metaphysical formulation, is the ultimate reference point for determing the truth regarding belief in Allaah and His Tawheed - and thus the revealed texts became of little use for them and were rendered nothing more than metaphors "to help those dumb, ignorant commoners acquire faith without hindrance" - and this is what they say, both the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, they say it in their books - and as for the real knowledge, then it is whatever comes from their intellects. And this is why they turned to the revealed texts and started playing around with them, distorting them, and explaining them away. To them, the revealed texts contain apparent <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and the revealed texts do not amount to certain definitive knowledge because they contain tashaabuh (ambiguity) and so on - these are their sayings, both the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>. They both say that the proof of the intellect is decisive over the revealed texts.    <P>
The difference occurring between them is like this:    <P>
<ul><li><u>The Philosophers</u> used this knowledge to speak about what they call "waajib ul-wujood" (that whose existence is necessary) with language that amounts to <u>an existence in the mind only</u> and nothing beyond that. And the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> claimed this is Tawheed - which is a notion of pure oneness in the mind - devoid of names, labels, meanings, concepts, attributes and so on. It is just pure oneness - and this has no external reality to it at all.</ul>    <P>
Then the factions of the Mutakallimoon:    <P>
<ul><li><u>The Mu'attil Jahmiyyah</u>, as they used these notions as the basis for proving a Creator, they denied Allaah could be described with anything that the creation is described with, as that would render Him to be a "jism (body)" like all the ajsaam (bodies) that make up the creation - and they pretty much agreed with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, their sayings are approximate. And they claimed that what they are upon is Tawheed.    <P>
<li>And <u>the Mu'tazilah</u> - basing their deen upon the same metaphysical credo - said we affirm Names (on the surface only) and because they did that, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (and the Jahmiyyah) said to them, "You are Mujassimah", because you affirm the notion of "kathrah" (numerousness) because you have affirmed divisibility (tajzi'ah) and composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) for Allaah on account of applying more than one  meaning or label to Him. So the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> called these people "<a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a>", whilst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> called themselves "Muwahhideen". This is because the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> did not meet the standards of tanzeeh set by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, because they tainted the notion of pure oneness (that exists only in the mind) with a multiplicity of labels (Names).    <P>
<li>And then <u>the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah</u> - basing their deen upon the same metaphysical credo - said we affirm those attributes that can be proven by the intellect and which are not <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and for this, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said to them you are "<a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a>" (as did the Philosphers and Jahmiyyah), because you tainted that notion of pure oneness by the addition of multiple attributes, and thus you have affirmed a multiplicity of eternal entities that must have existed along with the essence of the creator. And it is important to distinguish between the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> who believed in all the attributes (including those such as Face, Hands, Eyes) with the  exception the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will and power) such as love, pleasure, anger, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>,  <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> and so on - and between the later Asha'ris who tended back towards the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and affirmed none of the attributes except for seven - and they just made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of all of the rest.</ul>    <P>
So we see that all of them lay claim to that underlying foundation - the metaphysical classifications, terminology and language which they use - in their own ways - to argue for their credo. Their only differences are concerning what can and cannot be negated to avoid invalidating that base and foundation, which is the intellectual proof based upon the metaphysical classifications and terms.    <P>
So the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> argue for what they call the "Waajib ul-Wujood" (the Necessarily Existent) and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> argue for what they call the Maker, Creator, Originator - <b>and then all of them are bound and forced to describe Allaah in a manner that must be in accordance with the same metaphysical classification and terminology</b> - and hence you see that they are all in agreement with each other in saying about Allaah (or the Necessarily Existent) that (quoting <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> verbatim):    <P>
<ul><li>He exists, (but) is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>),   <li>and nor a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>),   <li>and nor an incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>),   <li>and nor is He inside the universe,   <li>nor outside of it,   <li>nor attached to it,   <li>nor separate from it,   <li>and He is not in a location (makaan),   <li>and nor is He in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>),   <li>rather all the directions are devoid of Him</ul>    <P>
And is there any proof of their falsehood greater than this. They are all united in reality - since what they have made to the be the foundational knowledge for what can and cannot be said about Allaah - is language and terminology of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves, which essentially is Aristotle's <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) with <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) incorporated into it by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and then all of that "borrowed" by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "Dhamm ul-Kalaam" and as mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>":    <P>
