<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Please do not proceed with this article unless and until you have read the series in sequence. In <b><a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>Part 1</a></b> we outlined a framework (indicating eleven groups to be aware of and to distinguish between), in <b><a href=index3639.html?emuan>Part 2</a></b> we established the true position of the Salaf and some from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, such as <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers in relation to 'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (those attributes known through revealed text alone). In <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 3</a></b>, we established that the Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were led to their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> respectively because they are operating upon <u>the same foundations</u>, which is the language of <u>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</u> and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (origination of bodies). <b>Part 3 is really crucial to this entire series</b>. In <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 4</a></b> we looked at the Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and saw how, <u>upon their ilm al-kalaam</u>, concluded Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and subsequently described Him with associated descriptions, entering into <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> [upon the understanding of the Ahl al-Kalaam] and takyif through that. This is in addition to what they inherited of the tasbhih of the very early Raafidah in deification of some from the creation. We also also saw the battle in the language of words between them (the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and Mu'attilah).     <P>
<img src=assets/images/custard-pie.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=1 border=0> <b>It is also  crucial for you to go and observe <u>the great big custard fight</u> that took place between the Mu'attilah and Mujassimah</b> in the Kalam Cage, we observed it in <a href=index8ba5.html?uhzra>Part 4</a> with ringside commentary, and there is some more action a little later in this article. In this article we will cover another group of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and they are from the Hanafis. By now, you should have realized that the worst of the "<a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a>" were actually <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> themselves, the brethren of the Mu'attilah [Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah] in 'ilm al-kalaam, and what led them to <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> is the very thing that led the others to <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Sources of Information</font>    <P>
We are going to rely upon these books for the documentation of the statements of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> coming from the Karraamiyyah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/farq-bayn-al-firaq.gif border=1 border=0>  <img src=assets/images/baghdadi-usul-al-din.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
They are two books of <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H) an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar, <i><b>Usul al-Din</b></i> and <i><b>al-Farq bayn al-Firaq</b></i>. You can refer to the relevant entries in these books under the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. Rather than provide full translations of entire passages, we are going to provide summary statements which will be exact translations of sentences in any case. Before we draw from these books to show the statements and views of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, we need to give some explanations so you understand where they were coming from and what their angle was.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding Definitions That Are Fabricated</font>    <P>
As we alluded earlier in this series, the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, in order to construct their theology, fabricated their own definitions for terms, with meanings that have no basis in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or the language of the Arabs. Examples we gave [and some of which have been discussed in length in other articles (such as highlighting Naruiji's <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>academic frauds</a>)] include <i><b>al-ahad</b>, <b>al-waahid</b>, <b><a href='tags/al-tarkib.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-tarkib</font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></b></i>. In order to truly fathom what was going on with all of these theological debates you have to appreciate that the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are operating upon polluted language, and you have to be aware of this when you are speaking to people who have been poisoned and intoxicated with it.     <P>
<blockquote>With respect to the term <u><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></u>, it has two basic meanings. It refers to a) al-jasad, al-badan, the entity itself, whatever is being referred to, or b) the meaning of thickness,  density pertaining to an entity. That is its meaning in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and of the Arabs. To the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Mu'attilah or Mujassimah), they have their own devised definition for it, and their terms vary, some of them say, "<i>whatever consists of two indivisible particles</i>", and some say three, and some of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said <u>six</u> or <u>eight</u> (which means that extension would be in all three directions), and some of them said, "<i>whatever occupies space, a space occupying entity</i>", <i>"whatever has the three spatial extensions (length, breadth, depth)</i>", "<i>whatever can be pointed at</i>", "<b><i>whatever is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>, composed (murakkab, mu'allaf)</i></b>", that is one of their key ones. Also, <i>whatever is said about it that it is here or there</i>". And there is also "<i>whatever is etablished by itself (al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi)</i>", "<i>whatever exists (mawjood)</i>" (these last two are from <u>the Karraamiyyah</u>). </blockquote>    <P>
We have around twenty or so definitions amongst them.  What is important here, is that these people fabricated new meanings as a means to construct and validate their own theology [be they Mu'attilah or Mujassimah], which fundamentally is not based upon the principle of "Affirming for Allaah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him," rather, it is:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Proving the universe is originated with a proof based upon the conceptual tools and language of astray nations from the past then making reason (aql) the judge of what Allaah ought to be described with to conform to that proof and then making distortion of the texts that do not agree with that version of theism (because they imply <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> or hawaadith).</b></blockquote>    <P>
So they all formulated their own definitions, and they have many differences amongst themselves and they refute each other in these definitions.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>You would do well <u>to keep this in mind</u>, as this will help you grasp the realities, formulate the full picture, understand the sayings and orientations of each faction, and separate between them and operate upon justice, and when you have "got it", you should then be enraged for having had your mind toyed with by shysters and fraudsters who led you to falsely accuse innocent Muslims, let alone scholars, of what they are free of.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> are named after <u>Muhammad bin Karraam al-Sijistaanee</u> (d. 255H) and he was from the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>.  They were Murji'ah in Eeeman and were Ahl al-Ra'i (people of opinion). They appeared around the same time, if not shortly after the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>. They debated the Jahmiyyayh, Raafidah and fiercely debated the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and agreed with them (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah) on those usool which led them (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah) to whatever it led them to (<a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>). These usool were the language of al-a'raad and al-ajsaam and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>. However, he differed with them on the absoluteness of one of its premises. First let us revisit this proof that all of these people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (Mu'attilah or Mujassimah) founded their theology upon:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Proof of Huduth al-Ajsaam</font>    <P>
The proof tries to establish the universe is originated and hence the existence of a creator. The argument is:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>a)</b> that everything in the universe is body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (indivisible particle) or incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) <b>b)</b> that incidental attributes definitely exist (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) like color, taste, smell, motion, rest, combination, separation, breadth, width, height, texture and so on to all possible attributes of things and their opposites <b>c)</b> that these <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> are therefore originated, that is they are events (hawaadith) that came to be (because they cannot exist on their own) <b>d)</b> that bodies (ajsaam) that make up the universe are never devoid of these incidental attributes (which are hawaadith, events), they never precede them, and they are never separate from them (meaning no body in the universe is absent the genus of incidental attributes, it must have something from them, and thus every body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) has hawaadith) <b>e)</b> and upon the principle that whatever is not devoid of, absent, or prior to hawaadith, must itself be <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>, originated <b>f)</b> Hence, all bodies in the universe are originated <b>g)</b> And because whatever is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated) must have a muhdith (originator), then Allaah exists.</blockquote></div>    <P>
This is the core of it and all of these are its basic premises and all of these groups are united upon its basic premises. Note that premise <b>e)</b> is the greatest foundation of the Mu'attilah, it is the foundation of <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, its chief and master, and it is the basis for all of his <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>. And this premise is uniform for all the Mu'attilah, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah <u>and also the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>. And as for <b>g)</b>, it is a sound priciple mentioned in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and known through fitrah and reason. The major portion of the time, effort and resources spent by the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> was on <b>a)</b> to <b>e)</b> and you will see this manifest in the books of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. They spent a lot of time debating and refuting each other on the deeper technical issues related to <b>a)</b> to <b>e)</b> - whilst being united on the actual framework.     <P>
The following words are pertinent at this point:    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">This is the proof on account of which al-Jahm bin Safwaan entered his taaghoots into the Ummah. This is the proof on account of which the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> put the Ummah and its scholars to trial. This is the proof whose presumed truth was taken up by the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. This is the proof which split and divided the Ummah after the Khawarij, Raafidah, Murij'ah and Qadariyyah. This is the proof on account of which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazlah invented their "<a href="tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" (tahrif). This is the proof on account of which they [Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah] considered the aql to be definitive and have precedence over the naql (revealed texts), as explicitly laid down by al-Razi's "Universal Principle" for all <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> after him. This is the proof upon which al-Maturidi was building his creed upon, over yonder, beyond the river. This is the proof and its underlying language that is behind the <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> of the Rafidi <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. This is the proof and its language on account of which the Hanafi Karraamis from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> based their <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and its language of takyif. Al-Maturidi the Hanafi Mu'attil and Ibn Karram, the Hanafi Mujassim, two stains upon Hanafiyyah, besides that of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and all are Ahl al-Kalaam). This is the proof which became the basis of many a subsequent innovation and instilling of hatred in the hearts. This was the proof brought into the Ummah by al-Ja'd bin Dirham who took it from the Sabean star, planet and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers, and whose underlying language had already been toyed with by the Hellenized Jews and Christians aforetime (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>read this series</a>).  This is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which the Salaf condemned, and perhaps [O gathering of contemporary Jahmites] your intellects are still with you such that you take heed of saying of <u>Abu Haneefah</u> (d. 150H):     <P>
Nuh al-J&#257;mi&#703; said: I said to Ab&#363; Han&#299;fah: What do you say about what the people have innovated of speech regarding <i>al-a&#703;r&#257;d</i> and <i>al-ajs&#257;m</i>? He said, "(Nothing but)  the sayings of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.  Upon you is (to follow) the narrations and the path of the Salaf, and beware of every newly-invented matter, for it is an innovation.    <P>
Free and innocent is <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and his associates from that Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, the Mu'attil (that's another article) and that Muhammad bin Karraam, the Mujassim!  This is <u>the very proof</u> on account of which Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, the people of Sunnah, Hadith and Aathar, were declared <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> by al-Ja'd bin Dirham, <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Amr bin Ubayd and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and their tail-ends, the Later <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and the Maturidiyyah.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Inside the Karraamite Mind</font>    <P>
Let's get into the minds of those Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>.    <P>
The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> reasoned that things are only bodies (ajsaam) and their incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), and since Allaah cannot be an incidental attribute (which cannot exist of its own accord) <u>He must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</u>. Some of them said "<b>a body unlike bodies</b>" and Ibn Karraam himself said "<b>a body like bodies</b>" based upon his agreement with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that attributes and actions can only be established in bodies.     <P>
<blockquote>However, they differed with the rest of their brethren from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> [Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah] on one of the major premises which is: <b>A <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> is never devoid of hawaadith (events, those affairs which have a beginning, meaning here attributes and actions)</b>. The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> disagreed on the absoluteness of this principle and said that this is not the case for Allaah, the Most High. They did not reject this principle, rather they accepted it, but did not accept that it is absolute. They said it is possible for there to be <u>an eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, that was devoid of all hawaadith in eternity</u>. They said Allaah (the eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, single, pure, unified, one) was devoid of hawaadith for a period of eternity. Hence, he is not like all the other bodies which are <u>never</u> devoid of hawaadith (meaning the qualities and attributes found in them). This is why some of them said "<i>jism laa kal-ajsaam</i>." So here, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> established a difference betweeen the eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and the created ajsaam, and what is the essential differene between the eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and the created ajsaam? This difference is from the angle of whatever is obligatory (waajib), permissible (jaawaaz) and prohibited (mumtani'). Thus Allaah is a body. Created things are bodies. What's the difference between them? The difference is known and defined through what can be said to be obligatory (waajib), permissible (jaawaaz) and prohibited (mumtani') upon that eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and these created ajsaam. It is prohibited for created ajsaam to be free of hawaadith, but not for  Allaah. So this is how Allaah "does not resemble" the created bodies, it is in terms of what is permitted, obligatory and prohibited, and this is what they mean by "<i>a body, unlike other bodies</i>."    <P>
Hence, they said Allah was an eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, devoid of hawaadith, but then Allaah acquired attributes, through His own wish and power, which means  hawaadith (events that have a beginning) took place in Him. Thus whilst He may have had <u>the (future) capacity</u> to speak (but not actually being one who speaks for a period in eternity), He then acquired speech, and became one who speaks but was not one who was eternally one who speaks as and when He wills. They stated this upon the principle "<b>an endless chain of events in the past is impossible</b>", and this is a premise required by the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. Hence, Allaah cannot eternally have been one who speaks as and when He wills, that clashes with the proof, as it means an endless chain of events in the past. So the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> permitted for Allaah that events can take place in His essence, and what they mean here is <u>the acquisition of attributes</u>. <u>However</u>, <i>and this is crucial</i>, they did not consider this position of theirs to clash with the proof, and nor did they consider this to clash with the greatest principle in this proof which is "<i>whatever is not devoid of hawaadith is itself haadith</i>", because to them something is only an event (<a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>) <u>if it occurs and expires</u>, if it has been brought about (ihdaath) and caused to expire (ifnaa'). Thus, once Allaah became one who speaks, He always remained one who speaks, hence this cannot be entered into what are hawaadith. So they permitted "hawaadith" to take place but not to expire, so technically these are not really "hawaadith" (events that arise and then expire) in their view.   And the reason why they  rejected that Allaah could be <u>eternally</u> one who speaks as and when He wills is that this would necessitate and endless chain of events in the past. The proof relies upon the denial of an endless chain of events in the past. And in order to remain true to this proof, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> denied that Allaah has always been one who speaks as and when He wills in eternity, or creates as and when He wills in eternity and so on (even though He might have had the future capacity, ability to be so, yet He was not). This was their way of thinking. And with this approach, they believed they remained true to that framework of huduth al-ajsaam with all its premises.     <P>
To illustrate with another example in addition to that of speech:  The attribute of "khalq" (creating), they said Allaah was not able to act, create (although He had <u>the future capacity</u> to), but then He was able to act, create, He brought about this in Himself, and <u>this remained permanent, eternal thereafter</u>. Hence it is not "hawaadith" in reality, because the quality has not expired, it remains, unlike true "hawaadith", they occur and expire. So they believed they are still operating within the proof and have not opposed it. And the reason why they said that Allaah could not have been "the creator" in eternity is that it would necessitate endless chain of events in the past. Further, they held a view on this particular issue of Allaah "creating" that resembles the view of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> in denying that an act called "creating" could be ascribed to His essence. So they had an approach to this similar to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, even if they had their own angle regarding it. We have omitted this discussion as it is lengthhy and detailed and is not crucial for the purposes of this article.    <P>
<b>The way the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> saw it is just like a man has the future capacity for speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and action (fi'l) and power (qudrah) when he is born, without actually having it. Then later he acquires them. So they saw Allaah like that. They held this view to remain true to the premises of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, all of which rest upon the denial of an endless chain of events in the past. The proof cannot be completed without this statement. This claim of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> of an eternal <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> devoid of what they call "hawaadith" (meaning attributes) is falsehood because it implies Allah was deficient and acquired attributes He did not have.</b></blockquote>    <P>
Note that we have left out a lot of detail here as things would otherwise get very technical. We have left out a lot of detail in relation to matters and principles in which the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> agree with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and Ash'aris and Maturidis) and some in which they have a different approach. But for the purpose of this article, what we have stated above is sufficient.     <P>
As for <u>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah</u> they say:    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah has always been one who speaks as and when and He wills. He did not acquire any new attribute He did not already have. That Allaah never ceased with all His attributes is the saying  of Ahl al-Sunnah, so Allaah is not subject to "hawaadith" upon the understanding of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> (meaning acquisition of attributes). Rather Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah say that Allaah has never ceased with all His names and attributes, both those that are laazim (necessary to His essence) and those that are muta'addi (transitive, in the sense that they relate to another  object), so  al-Khaaliq, al-Raaziq, al-Muhyee, al-Mumeet are all transitive names, their meanings require other objects, Allaah creates something, Allaah provides with something, Allah gives life to something, Allaah takes life from something. Ahl al-Sunnah say Allaah has never ceased to be like this, meaning Allaah never ceases to create if He wills, never ceases to provide if He wills, never ceases to give life if He wills, never ceases to take life if He wills. And likewise He has never ceased to be one who speaks when and as He wills with whatever He wills. And in all of that nothing precedes Allah in His existence, rather everything besides Allaah was brought into existence after non-existence.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understand What is Going on Here Between the <a href="tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></font>    <P>
It is important <u>to stop here</u> to understand what is really going on in the overall scheme of things, in the "birds-eye" of things, and once you get this way of thinking into your mind, and you start seeing the overall picture, and start building some context, you will start to see the pieces fit together. So here it is:    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;"> First thing to note is that all of these <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups are working on the same building. They have the same tools, the same types of bricks, there is a specific blueprint, and a specific goal. The goal is to build a solid proof for the universe being originated and to prove a creator. However, they all have different ways of going about it and in their unique approaches, they are adhering (in their view) to what they consider are the basic rules, which is the basic outline, the procedure for demonstrating <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (as described previously). So they share in:    <P>
<b>a)</b> The <u>same foundational language</u>, <i>al-a'raad wal-ajsaam</i>, <b>b</b>) The <u>same foundational theoretical premise</u> underlying the entire theology which is making <i>qiyas al-shumul</i> (analogy through inclusion) or <i>qiyas al-ghaa'ib alaa al-shaahid</i> (analogy for the unseen through the seen) or <i>qiyas al-tamthil</i> (analogy through likeness). What this means is that Allaah, the Creator, has to be included within the genus of created bodies for the purpose of being able to speak with the lawaazim (binding nececessities) from which the entire language of theology emanates (i.e. "<i>Allaah is a not a jism</i> etc." for the Mu'attilah, or "<i>Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> etc.</i>" for the Mujassimah). We explained this in more detail in <a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 3</a> and <a href=index8ba5.html?uhzra>Part 4</a>, <b>c)</b> The <u>same basic framework</u> for the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (demonstrating the origination of bodies) which was outlined earlier in this article.     <P>
However, they have their own renditions or interpretations around it whilst adhering (in their view) to its core premises. Basically its a fight and each group is laying claim to being the one who has the "holy grail" [sorry for using that term, but there's nothing else we could think of to get the right message across]. So basically its the trail for the "holy grail" for proving the universe is originated, to prove a creator. It's like a gold rush and each party wants to be the one to make that "killer" find. In that "intellectual race," the Mu'attilah were led to <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were led to <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> - but they were all pushed in their own particular directions through this proof that they are all agreed upon. <i>They (Mu'attilah, Mujassimah) are all one party, one group, one brotherhood</i>. They are all expressing views, opinions etc. through which they are trying to keep in conformity with that basic framework of huduth al-ajsaam. And some of them are saying to others, "Hey, you've corrupted the proof" and others are saying "No we haven't, you have!" So the Jahmee says to the Mu'tazilee, "You've corrupted the proof, take that!" and he throws his custard pie. The Mu'tazilee says to the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, "You've corrupted the proof" and he throws his custard pie, and the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> says to the Karraami "You've corrupted the proof", and the Karraami says to the Raafidee "You've corrupted the proof" and so its all one big custard fight as we observed in <a href=index8ba5.html?uhzra>Part 4</a>. This is why <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H), states in  Usul al-Din (p. 337-338), in speaking about the Karraamiyyyah, "They have corrupted for themselves, by permitting <i>hulul al-hawaadith</i> (occurrence of events) in Allaah's essence, the evidence of the Muwahhideen for the [proof of] huduth al-ajsaam through hulul <a href='tags/al-hawaadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hawaadith</font></a>." And the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> have their own view, they claim they are in perfect agreement with all the premises of huduth al-ajsaam and have not corrupted it, rather they have championed it. So you get the idea of what is going on.     <P>
And these people who are in this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> cage, throwing custard pies at each other, are thinking they are the society's intellectual elite, they look down upon the people of Sunnah, Hadith and Aathar and consider them <u>the worthless Hashawiyyah</u>. This terms was thrown by one of the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against Abdullah bin Umar (and later taken up and used by the Ash'arites). And what they mean by it is those worthless, intellectually defunct people who don't have what we have, this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, this science, which makes us so special and clever. So they are in their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> cage throwing these custard pies at each other, and Ahl al-Sunnah look on, and this is the evil perception of those people towards Ahl al-Sunnah, when in reality, <u>the real buffoonery</u> is taking place in the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> cage. So you get the picture now.    <P>
<u>Once you understand these things</u>, trust us, no pseudo-Ash'arite neo-Jahmite shyster will have the guts to stand in front of you and look you in the face. He will cower, his soul in awe and fear, a coward of huge proportions, all he has with him are the cobwebs of his ancestry of old, using pathetic little doubts by isolating statements of al-Darimi, or <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and other scholars and scaring the dumb-witted ignorant people about those "<i>nasty evil body-snatching <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who've landed from Mars and are out there waiting to pounce on you</i>", when in reality, these "<i>nasty evil body-snatching mujassimah</i>" are their own brethren in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and they are in fact united with these <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> in the theoretical foundations of their creed and in the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, except that they have different ways of trying to validate this proof, as they each see it. These neo-Jahmite pseudo-Asharites are feeble-minded, intellectually defunct, they do not have any 'aql, since they already threw away their aql when they threw the revealed texts behind their backs considering them nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> for the "dumb commoners", and opted for al-Razi's "Universal Principle" (al-qaanoon al-kullee) which states the aql takes precedence over the naql. They claimed to establish the authenticiy, veracity and authority of the revealed texts [in the morning] through their proof as they claim, their aql, then [in the evening] they threw away their aql when they said these authentic, agreed upon, revealed texts [whose authority they had just proven through the same aql in the morning] are nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih implying kufr and that the real truth actually lies in their 'aql, in the language of <i>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</i>, in the very 'aql which they had used to prove the authority, authenticity and unquestionability of the naql (revealed text) in the morning. So what 'aql is that O disgraced ones!    <P>
So their reality is that they are simply trying to tarnish others with the dung of their own adversary from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. Basically, <u>it is their fight</u>, but they want to <u>drag you into it</u>, out of envious jealousy that you have the Sunnah, hadeeth and aathaar and are content with that, and they are full of doubt, insecurity, psychologial discomfort, bewildered as that is the very nature of that particular <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they indulgeld in (<i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>). So we will address these doubts, and expose these affairs in due course as part of this series inshaa'Allaah when the <u>fourth piece</u> in our toolset is unleashed, which is reserved for those pansified <i>makhaaneeth</i> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, who throw stones from glass houses.</font></blockquote>    <P>
We can now move on to see the language of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> in their theism.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Described Their Lord</font>    <P>
So after the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> concluded that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) upon the conceptual tools of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> (bodies and their incidental attributes) in the wider framework of trying to prove the universe is originated and proving a creator, it was inevitable that in their speech, in their theology, that they use corresponding language. So we are going to now draw from those books we mentioned at the beginning. So this is what  the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> said (with our comments), now most of it overlaps, but what concerns us here is the following:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Ibn Karraam said Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body). He would say Allaah has singularity of essence and singularity of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
The reality of the saying of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> is that some of them meant by the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> "that which exists (<i>mawjud</i>)" and "that which is established on its own (<i>al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi</i>)." Now from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are those who said that the difference between these people is <u>one of wording only</u>. We have a whole article dedicated to just this topic, and you can read that here:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Jism, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphists</font></a>)</b>: From the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Textbooks and in the Works of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah: A Brief Comparison - (<a href=index264c.html?bolnh>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
But there were some amongst them who believed that every <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> is made up of the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), and so <u>it is possible</u> that some of them spoke of Allaah being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> with this meaning, that He is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>. However, what is famous and well known from their leading Imaams like Ibn al-Haysam is something other than that, that by <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> they mean "existing (mawjud)" and "self-established (al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi)".     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Incidentally, Ibn al-Haysam debated with the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H) on the subject of al-'uluww in the court of the Seljuk leader Mahmud al-Subkatakayn, and <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> was unable to respond to the rulers question "Distinguish for me between this Lord you are describing and what is non-existent". So he wrote to Abu Ishaq al-Isfaraayeeni (d. 418H), another <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, and he was only able to advise by saying, "Whoever says Allah is above has made him into a body." So <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> came to the ruler and said, "If you say Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it is binding upon you to say He is a body." So this ruler snapped at him, "I am not the one who said Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in the first place, it is Allaah himself who said it! So there is nothing binding on me at all, and who are you to be making anything binding upon me [or upon Allaah for that matter]!" So he was confuted and silenced, and that was the limit of his 'aql.</div>    <P>
Also from the saying of Ibn Karraam:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He would say Allaah has a hadd (limit) and nihayah (end) in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that He is touching (mumaass) His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and that <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is a place for Him.

They said that He does not extend beyond <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, His width is as the width of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becomes filled of Him.

This is takyif following on from their saying that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), and this is speech which has no basis in the Book and the Sunnah. For this reason, others from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>  (who affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, like the early Kullaabis and early Ash'aris) refuted them with speech such as "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and <u>is not a jism</u></i>" and "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>without touch, contact, adjacency</u></i>" and "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <i>without nearness [that brings Him closer] or being distant [that makes Him further]</i></i>" and so on. They were refuting this takyif of the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. These were the early Kullabis and Ash'aris.     <P>
Incidentally, the Salafi Imaam, Abu Nasr al-Sijzee (d. 444H) who wrote a book in refutation of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> also used this negation in relation to <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (that Allah [Himself] is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without touch [mummaassah]), refuting those who claimed that. However this is specific negation which is not from the way of the Salaf. The point in mentioning this is to show that this takyif of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> was rejected by those upon the way of the Salaf too, even if it was in a manner that involved a methodological departure from the way of the Salaf, which is specific affirmation, with general negation (Allaah [Himself] is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, bilaa kayf, without how).    <P>
<blockquote><b>The <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who took the path of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying 'uluww altogether, they showed rejection against <u>everyone</u> who affirmed Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and they adduced arguments to refute this belief upon the principles of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. They slanderously imposed the takyif of the Mujassimaah upon Ahl al-Sunnah. Then in their great dishonesty, they found doubts [through historical occurrences] by which to justify this slander, and we will address these doubts in later articles inshaa'Allaah. From them is the saying of <u>Ibn al-Mubaarak</u>, <u>Ishaq bin Raahuyah</u> and <u><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a></u> - in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who claimed Allaah is in every place - that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with a "hadd" (as in He is separate from His creation. which means He is separate from His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and that His essence does not merge or mix with anything in the creation). So these people are very dishonest and they rely upon the ignorance of the audience to continue their great swindle. They do not distinguish between the language of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> of <b>their brethren</b> from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> which originates due to them having concluded Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> through the foundational language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> which they all share in, and between the speech and language of the Imaams of Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf that does not arise from within that framework, rather is completely outside of it and has nothing to do with it.</b></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Between the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a></font>    <P>
It is important to point out that the leading figures of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> such as Ibn al-Haysam deny that they make tasbhih like that of the Raafidah, even if they affirm they refer to Allaah as a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (in the manner outlined above, meaning "existing", "self-established"). <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> states regarding Ibn al-Haysam (in al-Milal wal-Nihal, Dar al-Ma'rifah, Beirut, 1993, 1/129):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And Ibn al-Haysam asserted that those matters which the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> apply to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, such as form, shape, [hollow] interior, roundness, abundance, touch, embrace, and what is like that is not similar to what the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> apply, such as Allaah creating Aadam with His hand and that He ascended over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that He will come on the Day of Judgement to judge mankind. And this is because we [Ibn al-Haysam] do not believe in any corrupt meaning in regard to all of that, such as limbs, parts, in explanation of hands. And likewise, in applying makaan (place) and the independence of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (in holding) Allaah as an explanation of "<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a>", and nor occupying spaces as an explanation of coming (majee'). But we have only applied them simply because the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has applied them, without takyif and tashbih, and whatever has not come in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the report (khabar), we <u>do not</u> apply it [to Allaah], like all the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> do.</blockquote>    <P>
What he (Ibn al-Haysam) is saying here is that they do not apply those attributes which the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> applied (<a href=index8ba5.html?uhzra>see previous article</a>), and as for what they affirm, it is only because the revealed texts speak of it, and in that they do not assert any corrupt meaning or takyif. However, what is apparent is that in the issue of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, takyif is related about them, and from Muhammad bin Karraam, and they entered into blameworthy language regarding it after their conclusion Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), even if they explained with meanings that their adversaries (the Ash'arites) could  not fault, such as "<i>mawjud</i>" (existing) and "<i>al-qaa'imu binafsihi</i>" (self-established) - <a href=index264c.html?bolnh >see this article</a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes</font>    <P>
What should be taken away from this article in this series is that we have built much more context now, and the bigger picture is now emerging. We have learned that:    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> The <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> are simply brethren of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, they are brothers of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. What has led them to their <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> is the same underlying foundations in language and in what they consider the most important foundation of the religion, to prove the universe is originated through <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>. So all of them should be included within the same box.    <P>
<b>TWO:</b>  We also learned that the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> differed with the others with respect to one premise of the proof, which is "<i>Every <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> is not devoid of hawaadith</i>", they did not accept the absoluteness of the principle, even though they spoke with it. They said there is <u>an eternal jism</u> (meaning one that exists, self-established) who was devoid of hawaadith (meaning, events, which are attributes or actions) for a period in eternity, hence He is not like created bodies. Then, through His will and power, He acquired attributes, such as speech and action and creating and so on. And they said this because if Allaah had eternally been one who speaks as and when He wills, creates as and when He wills, acts as and when He wills, this would violate one of the core premises of the proof, which is "<u>Events which have no beginning are impossible</u>." For the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be complete, this premise is needed to make <u>the connection</u> between its first half and its final part, it is the connector. However, in all of this, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> believed they are true to the proof and that they have the correct rendering of it.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> We learned that the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> used language of takyif in relation to Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, in which they were refuted by others from their brethren in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (who actually affirmed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, the early Kullabis, Ash'aris, even if they had certain approaches towards <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> because it is from the sifat fi'liyyah). However, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who receded into the views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, accused everyone who affirmed Allaah's 'uluww over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with the takyif of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, and this is slander and dishonesty, because Ahl al-Sunnah do not operate upon that language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> upon which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah and the Rafidi and Hanafi Karraami <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> [all of whom are Ahl al-Kalaam] built their theology upon. Hence, the lawaazim (binding necessities) they operate upon and accuse each other of, do not apply to Ahl al-Sunnah.     <P>
We gave the example before in a previous article in this series, all of these <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups are in the cage having a big custard fight. We are not in the cage in the first place, because we have are not operating upon their false analogies for Allaah (<i>qiyas al-shumul, qiyas al-ghaa'ib alaa al-shaahid, qiyas al-tamthil</i>) which they absolutely must speak with, in order for their entire theology to be plausible, because that is what it all rests on. But we have not agreed to that, we say Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, hence, these are false analogies and the lawaazim (binding necessities) built upon them are a mirage to us, they don't exist, they only exist in the mind which has been diseased with that specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which the Salaf condemned. However, the Mu'attil and the Mujassim from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, they are both operating upon these false analogies, and there is no other way for their theology to have any existence, except by assuming these analogies as the fabric of the entire polemical debate.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> That from the leading Imaams of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> are those who denied that they make tashbih like that of the Raafidah, and it is known and mentioned that the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> used to refute the Raafidah, in addition to debating the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.     <P>
<b>FIVE:</b> The Salaf never knew or warned against the "<a href="tags/tajsim.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tajsim</font></a>" of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, rather they warned against <u>Tashbih and Tamthil</u>, which is resembling or likening Allaah to His creation. They never considered the affirmation of 'uluww, the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah (face, hands, eye etc.) and the <a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a> (nuzul, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, love, pleasure, anger etc.) and all of what Allaah is decribed with to be "<a href="tags/tajsim.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tajsim</font></a>" upon the terminological usage of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. This was unknown to them, because those conceptual tools in matters of belief were shunned by them and considered heresy.     <P>
The issue of Allaah being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> or not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, that is a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> debate between the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> in the context of their proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> that is founded upon the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad. However, whilst the early Kullabis and Ash'aris well appreciated this fact (they themselves affirmed 'uluww and the sifat khabariyyah) - [and the reason was explained previously in that they never considered the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory or the only way to prove the origination of the universe and Allaah's existence] - the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who treated this proof <u>the same way as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah</u> [that is, Islam itself rests upon this proof and depends upon it], and were forced to deny Allah's 'uluww and all the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, they extended their accusation and slander of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> to everyone who affirmed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyayh, over and beyond their disputants in <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. In later times, there were scholars who may have got caught up in this type of language, those who never delved into this type of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> fundamentally, but they agreed with the conclusions of those who did and merged these conclusions with the subject of their real pre-occupation, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Hadith and their sciences, and they received a warped and distorted perception of what the Salaf were upon due to living in a certain time or period when this particular <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> belief was predominant and they had acquired knowledge within that setting. This is the true and real background to the statements coming from the likes of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar and their likes (we already commented on the reality of what happened to them in previous articles - see the introductory section to <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>this article</a> and also look at the "third faction" in <a href=index2670.html?kagzi>this article</a>). Hence, you will understand the attachment to these scholars by today's pseudo-Ashari <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> because they find a specific utility in them.</blockquote>    <P>
All of the above should have put another piece in the puzzle and built some further context for us. In our next article we are going to discuss a type of <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> that your pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmi swindler will have kept hidden from you as part of his centuries old deception. Yes, the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> from amongst the Extremist Sufis, perhaps the greatest and most repugnant type of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih.    <P>
