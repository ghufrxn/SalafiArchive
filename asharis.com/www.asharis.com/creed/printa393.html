<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
The statement in the title is narrated from a number of Scholars about the Ash'aris. Whilst two of them are very clearly the sayings of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> vehemently deny the third, which is that after the Prophet's passing away, he is no longer considered a Prophet. In this article we will document the Scholars who said this about them, and look at each of these three issues in detail.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Statements</font>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <u>Abu Isma'il al-Harawi al-Ansari</u> (d. 481H) said in his "Dhamm ul-Kalaam Wa Ahlihi" (5/139-140), under a section regarding the Ash'aris in particular:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/al-harawi-al-ansari-asharis-three-disgraces.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is authentic from the narration of Buraid bin Abdullaah bin Abee Burdah bin Abee Moosaa, from his grandfather, Abu Burdah, from his father, Abu Musa <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (radiyallaahu anhu), from the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), that he said: "No Jew or Christian hears of me and does not believe in me except that he enters the Fire", then he recited, "<b>And whoever disbelieves in him from amongst the factions, then the Fire is  his destination</b>." So he said, "No [Jew or Christian] hears of me...", so their doctrines were reduced to three things:     <P>
<ul><li> That there is no Lord above the heaven,   <li> And no Messenger [buried] in the rawdah,   <li> And no Book [i.e. Qur'an] on the Earth, </ul>    <P>
as I have heard <a href='tags/yahyaa-bin-ammaar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahyaa bin Ammaar</font></a> (rahimahullaah) judge upon them with this [that they say there is no <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon the Earth].    <P>
Even though they camouflage [these sayings], and keep them concealed and are averse to stating them openly, then their realities (i.e. these sayings) are binding upon them [on account of their underlying doctrines]. And they abolished taqleed, and thus declared their fathers, mothers, wives and the generality of the Muslims as disbelievers, and they made investigating <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (theological speculation) to be obligatory and they compelled the religion to it (the kalaam) with their claim, and [by implication] they declared the Salaf to be disbelievers.  </blockquote>    <P>
What <a href='tags/abu-ismail-al-harawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Isma'il al-Harawi</font></a> means by the mention of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> invalidating taqleed, is that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> considered the knowledge of their proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" that demonstrates the createdness of the universe to be obligatory because they made its knowledge to be the very basis of eemaan, and if one did not make inspection and inference (an-nadhar wal-istidlaal) with a view to understanding and knowing this proof (to validate his or her faith), then in the more extreme view of <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), such a one is a kaafir (disbeliever) and to other <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> he is a sinner or blameworthy. And thus, their saying (the extreme one amongst them) implies that all the Salaf - who never knew or delved into this proof derived from the notions of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> - were disbelievers, just as the fathers, and mothers and wives of these people - who never knew these affairs or learned them were also rendered disbelievers - because they never "validated" their eemaan. Please refer to <a href=index8c76.html?ublmv>this article</a> and <a href=index6538.html?xvsqm>this article</a> where we document the extreme view of <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) in this regard, as well as the sayings of other <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who made this to be the first obligation upon those who reach the age of legal responsibility.    <P>
And <u>Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee</u> (d. 620H) said in his book "Hikaayat ul-Munaadhara Fil-Qur'an" which is his documentation of a debate he had with the Ash'aris on the subject of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (p. 51):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-qudaamah-asharis-three-doctrines.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the reality of their madhhab is that:     <P>
<ul><li> There is no deity above the heaven,   <li> And no <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon the Earth,   <li> And that Muhammad [after his death] is not the Messenger of Allaah.</ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
And this has also been narrated from <u>Ibn al-Jawzee</u>, <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> mentions in as-Siyar (21/376) that Ibn al-Jawzee used to say:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> say: There is no Lord above the heaven, and no <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in the mus-haf and no Prophet in the grave. Three disgraces [instances of shame] for you.</blockquote>    <P>
And Ibn al-Jawzee had an intense dislike for the Ash'aris, alongside his confusion in the affairs of creed, for he was not stable in the affairs of creed, sometimes negating the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> and other times affirming them, sometimes affirming <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and other times speaking with the saying of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - so he is not to be depended upon in the affairs of creed. But what he has said here is also said by others, and he had a very severe stance towards the Ash'aris in their saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is created and is merely ink and paper and nothing else - and he has severe words about them in his book "Sayd ul-Khaatir" on this topic.    <P>
We will now look at each of these issues separately inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Ash'aris: There is No Lord Above the Heaven</font>    <P>
This is not disputed by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and they do not hide their opposition to the ijmaa' of the Salaf that Allaah, with His Essence, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. And in this they also oppose the early Kullabi Ash'aris who were agreed that Allaah, with His Essence, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Despite manifesting their clear opposition to this, they are careful at the same time in obfuscating their true and real view due to their knowledge that all people with sound fitrah would come to know what they really  mean and intend through their various formulations.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important Note Concerning the Early Kullaabis And Their Affirmation of Allaah Being Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and Their Responses to the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</b>    <P>
The <u>Salaf</u>, the <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, and the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u> and the early <u>Kullaabi Ash'aris</u> were all agreed that Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.     <P>
However, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, in their affirmation of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, they used certain excesses in language in their affirmation and so they said that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, "<i>With contact (mumaassah, mulaasaqah)</i>", "<i>Filling the Throne</i>", "<i>Confined by the Throne</i>" and what is similar to this. And in turn the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and Kullaabi Ash'aris retorted with "<i>without contact (mumaassah, mulaasaqah)</i>", and "<i>without confinement (tahdeed)</i>" and so on, alongside their affirmation that it is Allaah Himself, with His Essence, who is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> were of two groups: Those that said that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), intending merely that Allaah is "qaa'imun bi nafsihi" (established by His self) and that He is "mawjood" (exists), and not like the created bodies (see the Ash'ari textbook viewpoint on this group <a href=index264c.html?bolnh>in this article</a>). And those who made Allaah like the created bodies (ajsaam), and they were those who wallowed in <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>. So this faction was present at the height of the Kullaabi-Early-Ash'ari era (mid to late third century hijrah) and Ibn Karraam, to whom the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> are ascribed died in 255H.    <P>
And so the Kullaabi Ash'aris, whilst agreeing with the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> (and with the Salaf) that Allaah Himself, <u>with His Essence</u>, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, stated in their affirmation that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, "without contact, confinement, fixed in a place (as in like the created places)" and so on, and in this, they refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and also the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
In his book "al-Asnaa Fee Sharh <a href='tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a>  Allaah il-Husnaa", Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Ahmad <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (and he is the mufassir, author of al-Jaami' Li Ahkaam il-Qur'aan) says, when discussing the numerous opinions held on the issue of Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascending) over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (Volume 2, page 123):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qurtubi-baqillani-uluww.gif border=1 width=515 border=0>    <P>
And here is the translation of this statement:    <P>
<blockquote><b>And the sixth:</b> The saying of at-Tabaree, Ibn Abee Zayd, al-Qaadee Abdul-Wahhaab and a group (jamaa'ah) of shuyook (scholars) of hadeeth and fiqh (jurisprudence) and it is apparent (from) some of the books of the qaadee, Abu Bakr [al-Baqillani] - may Allaah be pleased with Him, <u>and [also] Abul-Hasan [al-Ash'ari]</u>. <b>And al-Qaadee Abd ul-Wahhaab quoted this from him, I mean from al-Qaadee Abu Bakr, textually - which is that He, the Sublime, ascends over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u> - and in some places they applied (the words) "<u>above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (fawqa arshihi)</u>"</b>.     <P>
The Imaam, Abu Bakr (Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Hadramee al-Qayrawaanee) said: "And that which I say is [what is] correct [i.e. Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, making <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> with His Essence], without confinement, nor fixing in a place, nor being inside of it, and without touching".    <P>
I [al-Qurtubi] say: This is the saying of al-Qaadee Abu Bakr in the book of his "Tamheed ul-Awaa'il". And we have mentioned it. And this has also been said by the teacher, Abu Bakr bin Fawrak in "Sharh Awaa'il il-Adillah", and it is the saying of Ibn Abdul-Barr, and at-Talamankee and others from amongst the Andulusians, and [also] al-Khattaabi in the book "Shi'aar ud-Deen", and that has already preceded.</blockquote>    <P>
Al-Qurtubi makes it clear that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> held Allaah to make <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> bi dhaatihi (with His Essence) and that He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (fawqa arshihi) and that this is the same view as Ibn Abee Zaid (al-Qayrawaanee al-Maalikee) al-Haafidh Abu Umar Ibn Abdul-Barr and Abu Umar at-Talamankee  (<a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>see their statements on here</a>). However, the Ash'arite <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> used language such as "<i>without, touch, confinement</i>" and the likes as a rebuttal of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, whereas the methodology of Ahl us-Sunnah is to avoid any language not established from any of the Salaf, and we see this clearly in the Imaams of the Salaf who were free of the language of both the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the Kullaabi, Ash'arite <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>.  </div>    <P>
When the above is established, we need to understand that there are multiple levels of talbees (deception) that the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (posing as Ash'aris) use in order confuse the people about the reality of their saying. So from them:    <P>
<b><u>Firstly:</u></b> Their claim to be in agreement with the early Kullaabi Ash'aris, when the early Kullaabi Ash'aris in fact affirmed Allaah Himself, <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u>, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - and in addition to that they negated the sayings of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and thus their view amounted to the saying that:    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah is indeed above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, <u>with His Essence</u>, and His being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, <u>with His Essence</u>, <u>does not necessitate</u> confinement by space, or touch, or contact (with the Throne), or Allaah being a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and what the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> say, that Allaah's being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, is with touch and contact and confinement and the likes, then it is false and denied. </blockquote>    <P>
And this is the reality of their saying.    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of today who fraudulently associate themselves with the early (Kullaabi) Ash'aris, whilst being heavens apart, they speak with the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Kafirs such as <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) - <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit >see here</a> - that "<i>Allaah is neither within the universe nor outside of it</i>", and they forbid that it be said that "Allaah is above the heaven, ascended above the Throne", and they figuratively interpret it to mean an aboveness in status and rank only, and not an actual aboveness with the essence, which they vehemently reject, using a variety of schemes and stratagems in wording and phraseology. At the same time they do not wish that the common-people understand the reality of what they are saying and thus they use a variety of trickery and deception in presenting their belief in this regard.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Secondly:</u></b> Further, and what ends their fraud decisively is that when these Kullaabi Ash'aris were refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - and we have presented their sayings in this regard in this series of articles - then were they refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> because the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were refusing to accept Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in terms of "status and rank"? Or were they refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> because the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were saying "Allaah is in every place, with His Essence"? And when the Salaf and the Kullaabi Ash'aris said to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, "Allaah is above the Throne", then if they meant that Allaah is above in the sense of "status and rank"<u>then how was that a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who were saying "Allaah is in every place with His Essence"</u>? And this brings to an abrupt end the fraudulent claim of those posing as followers of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> - free is he of them, and they of him - for he was upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> who was a stern affirmer of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and he was not upon the creed of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this regard.</div>    <P>
<b><u>Thirdly:</u></b> Their saying, "<i>Allaah is <u>not in a location</u> above the Throne</i>" is also from their talbees (deception) because what they intend by this is not what the early Kullaab Ash'aris were upon. They intend by this that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in reality. However as all people with sound fitrah would show rejection against them for explicitly stating this, they use deception to hide their real view and so they say,     <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We accept Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, do not lie upon us</blockquote>    <P>
And they mean that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>in terms of rank and status only</u>, not actually and in reality above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>with His Essence</u>. So when you hear someone say, "Allaah is not in a location above the Throne", <u>then know he is a Jahmee</u>, and he has no connection to the early Kullaabi Ash'aris in this regard, rather he is upon the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah:    <P>
Abul-Qasim Sulayman bin Ahmad at-Tabarani brings in "Kitaab us-Sunnah", as does adh-Dhahabi in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p.132-133) from al-Abbaas bin Fudayl al-Asfaatee from Sulayman bin Harb who said:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I heard Hammaad bin Zayd (b. 98H, d. 179H) (saying): I heard Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were mentioned, so he said: "The central axis of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven".</blockquote>    <P>
And adh-Dhahabi, in his "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" commented on this saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd).</blockquote>    <P>
And reflect upon what Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani, that great and pious scholar, said about the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in his time, and Hammaad bin Zayd who narrated this from Ayyub, and he was no more than 30 years of age, he knew this for a whole fifty years, and he knew what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were intending.     <P>
And we see that Hammaad bin Zayd (d. 179H) used to say what he had heard from Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H) as is reported by Imaam ad-Dhahabee, in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.146):    <P>

So the Salaf walillaahil-hamd were wise to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites, and all praise is due to Allaah who has preserved His deen through the speech of the pious Salaf.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Ash'aris: There is No <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> On The Earth</font>    <P>
This is from the greatest of their sayings that they try to conceal and try to obfuscate, and then this saying of theirs is mentioned openly and proclaimed about them, they suffer an enormous amount of distress.    <P>
And the explanation of this saying of theirs is as follows:    <P>
<b>Regarding the Proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</b>    <P>
All of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) consider the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" to be the ultimate truth upon which the veracity of Islam itself depends. This proof is based around the notions of Aristotelian classification of al-Jawhar wal-Arad, or al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar (Aristotle's Ten Categories). This proof argues that in everything we see around us in the observable universe, there are what we call <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (qualities), and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental temporary attributes) and occurrences, events (hawaadith). And that these things are found in all the substances (jawaahir) and bodies (ajsaam) that make up the universe proves that these bodies must themselves also be occurrences (having come about after non-existence). And since, it is impossible for their to be infinite occurrences in the past without their being the one who originate them, this proves, by extension from the proof that has just demonstrated the universe must be created that there must be a creator.    <P>
When they made this flawed, corrupt proof to be the very foundation of Islaam and Imaan (and some of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>, d. 478H made takfeer of those who reached the age of responsibility and did  not look into this proof) - then it led them to start rejecting the Names, Attributes and Actions of Allaah, because all of this would have rendered their proof invalid, or it would have necessitated that Allaah Himself is also an event and created - why because He is described with Names, Attributes and Actions, and if you apply their false, corrupt proof to Allaah, it means Allaah is created.    <P>
<ul><li>So <u>the Jahmiyyah</u> denied every Name and description - with the exception of al-Khaliq, al-Qadir (the Creator, the All-Powerful) for the reason that they only belong to Allaah alone and the creation is not described with them at all (the basis of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> falling into Jabr, which is that the servant's actions are forced upon them without them performing them of their own will and volition). They found no way to reconcile the affirming of Names, Attributes and Actions for Allaah with this proof.    <P>
<li> <u>The Mu'tazilah</u> tried to affirm the Names, but only the surface and treated them as synonymous labels that just point to Allaah's essence and which in themselves do not point to independent meanings or comprise Attributes, thus Allaah is al-Aleem (all-Knowing), but without ilm (knowledge), and this name simply refers to Allaah Himself, to His Essence, and the same for all other Names. And they rejected everything else, the Attributes and Actions of Allaah which are tied to Allaah's will and power. So they found a way to reconcile the affirmation of Names for Allaah with this proof.    <P>
<li> <u>The Kullaabiyyah</u> are the followers of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) and they tried to tread a middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl us-Sunnah so they affirmed, the Names and those attributes which are the attributes of the essence (sifaat dhaatiyyah) but they rejected those attributes of Allaah which are tied to His will and power (sifaat fi'liyyah, af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah) meaning the actions of Allaah, those which He chooses to do. So the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> found a way to reconcile the Names, and some of the Attributes (sifaat dhaatiyyah) with this proof, but could not reconcile those actions that Allaah chooses to do and which He is not always described with, such <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> (ascent), an-nuzool (descent), love, pleasure, anger and so on. These amount to events (hawaadith) to them, and this could not be reconciled with the proof at all. The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> did however, affirm Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, as has preceded and they refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this issue.    <P>
<li> <u>The Kullaabi Ash'ariyyah</u> are Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and the earlier Ash'aris and they simply adopted the bulk of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, so they spoke with the sayings of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> with some minor differences here and there, and this was the creed of the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>. They affirmed the Names, the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah, but denied the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> - and it is not correct to attribute to them that they only affirmed seven attributes, rather they affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah as we have shown elsewhere on this site.     <P>
<li><u>The Later Ash'aris</u> (from the mid-fifth century onwards, such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> d. 478H) reverted to many of the views of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, especially in their rejection of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness with His Essence) and some of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah, such as face, hands, eyes. So they added this rejection of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to the rejection of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> of the Kullaabis and Early Kullaabi Ash'aris.  </ul>    <P>
With this background, we now need to focus on the view of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> that is related to Allaah's Speech.     <P>
<b>Regarding Allaah's Attribute of Speech</b>    <P>
Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is a permanent attribute of the essence in the sense that Allaah has always been "one who speaks". At the same time Allaah is able to speak as and when He wills, however He wills. So Allaah has always been mutakallim (one who speaks), and at the same time He speaks (yatakallam) when He wills however He wills. Therefore, Allaah spoke to Moses, and Allaah will speak on the Day of Judgement and Allaah says to every person who prays and recites the Faatihah, "My servant has praised me..." and so on. So we see Allaah speaks as He wills, to whomever He wills, when He wills, however He wills. All of this so far is the belief of Ahl us-Sunnah.    <P>
However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Kullaabi Ash'aris and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> all do not accept that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, because this would amount in their view, that Allaah is subject to hawaadith (events, occurrences) and this would mean Allaah is subject to change (taghayyur), and this would make Allaah no different to the bodies (ajsaam) in the universe. If Allaah had many instances of speech that are other than each other this entails multiple actions occurring which never occurred before and thus these would entail "events, occurrences" (hawaadith). And likewise, if Allaah became pleased or became angry - this would mean Allaah is being acted upon, that these attributes occur due to something external to Allaah, and this is what is called affection (infi'aal) according to Aristotle's categories which is one of the incidental attributes of bodies (ajsaam). And collectively, that Allaah chooses to act (according to His will and power) as He will, and when He wills and however He wills, and that Allaah becomes pleased and angry, then this all amounts to "taghayyur" (change) in Allaah's essence, and change proves something is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and this would falsify the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", which means Allaah's existence cannot be proved, which means Islam itself is destroyed.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And it is for this reason that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Atheists of all times have never ceased to attack Islaam, especially through the folly of the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, and through this flawed, corrupt, vile, proof of theirs that was pioneered first by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and followed by the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, and all of the necessities following on from it.</div>    <P>
And you can take a look at this diagram here to better grasp what is going on and what these people made to be the reality of Tawheed:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aristotle-maqoolaat-al-ashar.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Therefore in order to deal with this problem, they had to hold a particular position on Allaah's Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>), and by implication on the Qur'aan, because it is from Allaah's Speech. So we will look at their views and how they dealt with this problem.    <P>
<b>Views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> on the Qur'an</b>    <P>
The saying of <u>the Jahmiyyah</u> is that the Qur'aan is created, that Allah does not have the attribute of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) to begin with, and He is not "mutakallim" (one who speaks), and they interpret "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) to mean something that Allaah creates in the creation separate from Himself. So Allaah created the "Qur'aan" and He thereafter called it "His Speech" in the same manner that it can be said, "Baytullaah" about the Ka'bah, and "Naaqqatullaah", the She-Camel of Allaah and so on. In this manner, they managed to free Allaah of "actions" that signify "occurrences, events" (hawaadith), and thus prevented Him from being considered a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - and therefore the intellectual proof is saved.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The tongue of disposition:</b> Hallowed be the intellectual proof which is the essence of Tawheed, thank you <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> for without your Ten Categories, we'd never understand the true and real Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-Arad - and as for the language of the Tawheed the Messengers, it must be distorted, changed and figuratively explained because it is nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, namely, outright kufr. Hallowed be the intellectual proof.</div>    <P>
And <u>the Mu'tazilah</u> took up this deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their view is the same as that of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the Qur'aan is created with the only difference being that they say Allaah created it in the self of Jibreel (alayhis salaam) and Jibreel expressed it in his own words, or that he simply "quoted" the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that was created in his self. And that the speech of Allaah can be created in different situations, so for example, with Moses, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) was created in the tree and so on. So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> too, being from those who indulged greatly in debates with the Atheists and the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> (Indian Materialist Philosophers), prevented the intellectual proof from being invalidated.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The tongue of disposition:</b> Hallowed be the intellectual proof which is the essence of Tawheed, thank you <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> for without your Ten Categories, we'd never understand the true and real Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-Arad - and as for the language of the Tawheed the Messengers, it must be distorted, changed and figuratively explained because it is nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, namely, outright kufr.

Then came <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u>, followers of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H). <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> tried to reconcile between the view of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (<a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>) and Ahl us-Sunnah. They held the very same view of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, recited, heard, written and memorized, is created and not from Allaah's speech in reality (whilst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> affirm speech for Allaah figuratively and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> deny it altogether). Except that the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> added something on top of the saying of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Which is that although the Qur'aan we have with us is created, meaning those words of the Qur'aan that are with us  - there is also <u>another Qur'an</u> which is from what they call <u><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></u> which is a singular meaning (that comprises the entirety of Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> from eternity) and which resides in Allaah's self. So pay attention. They do not differ with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is actually created (makhlooq). All these factions are in agreement. But the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> (and Ash'ariyyah) say that this <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> is the meaning that is present with Allaah, it is not really "speech" (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) with its proper definition, rather it is meaning (ma'naa) only, and that this meaning was put into the self of Jibreel (i.e inspired), and then Jibreel expressed it in his own words - and the end result is what we have, the Qur'aan and that is created. So the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is the created "quotation" (hikaayah) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is with Allaah (from eternity).    <P>
As for <u>the Ash'ariyyah</u>, then as mentioned previously, their creed was simply the Kullaabi creed, and their saying is exactly the same as the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> except that they said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is a created "expression" (ibaarah) of the eternal <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is with Allaah. So the Kullaabi Ash'aris believe in two Qur'ans, not one. In fact, the reality is that they do not consider this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have with us to be the real <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, it is just something created, from the created speech of one of the creation (Jibreel) and written in paper and ink.    <P>
And regarding the saying of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, then through it they managed to avoid negating the attribute of Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) for Allaah (thereby opposing the Jahmiyyah), so they affirmed it in the manner of a singular indivisible meaning residing with Allaah's Self from eternity (thereby differing with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as to exactly what constitutes "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>"), and this doctrine they innovated would not clash with the intellectual proof, however because they rejected that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power (remember, fi'l, action and infi'aal, affection are both properties of bodies), then they could not attribute this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have with  us, written, memorized, heard, recited, to Allaah (this would invalidate the intellectual proof), and thus they harboured the same view as the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that it is created. And in essence, this means that there is no <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon this earth, meaning that which they consider the actual speech of Allaah, which is the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>. so in reality we do not have a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> on this earth, and this is the reality of the saying of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. And as usual, they detest that this should be made known about them, and utilize a variety of strategems in order to obfuscate and conceal this saying of theirs for fear that of scorn from the people. See this article: <b>The Ash'aris: We Believe in Two Qur'ans</b>  (<a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>read here</a>).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> <b>The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> Are United That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> We Have With Us is Created - There Real Difference is Only About Definitions</b>    <P>
The view of the Ash'aris and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is EXACTLY the same with the only difference being that what the Ash'aris call "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" is what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> call knowledge and will (ilm, iraadah). Both are agreed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, in letter and word, recited, heard and memorized is created. We have firmly established this from their own books.    <P>
<ul><li><b>Imaam ul-Haramayn <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created - We Just Differ on a Matter of Wording Which Is On Account Of What Can We Call Allaah 'Mutakallim' (One Who Speaks) - (<a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>see here</a>)  <li><b>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti</b>: We (The Ash'aris) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are United that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Is Created And What the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Call 'Knowledge (al-Ilm)' and 'Will (al-Iraadah)', We Simply Call 'al-Kalaam an-Nafsee' - (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see here</a>)  <li><b>Fakhr ud-Deen <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the (Recited) <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created And Our Dispute Is One of Wording Only - (<a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>see here</a>)  <li><b>The <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of al-Bayjoori</b>: The Qur'aan We Memorize and Recite Is Makhlooq (Created) And Is From <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> - But We Only Say That In Private, Not Openly - (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>see here</a>)</ul>  </div>    <P>
In conclusion then, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (imitating the Kullaabiyyah), in attempting to defend that intellectual proof that is made to be the very basis of Islaam and Imaan and which is found in all their major textbooks as the very first thing discussed, they were led to the rejection of Allaah's actions tied to His will and power, from which is His speech, meaning that He speaks as and when He wills, and thus their saying was the same as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, except that they innovated a way to affirm "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" for Allaah, which is the through the false doctrine of "kalam nafsee" (a singular, indivisible meaning present with Allaah) which would not stand the scrutiny of a five year old.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The tongue of disposition:</b> Hallowed be the intellectual proof and hallowed be Aristotle's Ten Categories for they are the ultimate underlying truths for understanding Tawheed and they cannot be subject to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, they are definitive and decisive, free of ambiguity and even if these people whose language and terminology we made use of were misguided in their sayings and beliefs, nevertheless, their <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> and their classification of the universe surely aided and helped us to devise an intellectual proof ("<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>") through which we combated them and on the basis of which we were able to truly understand what the Messengers were unable to express in clear unambiguous words.  Rather, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qu'ran</font></a> and the Sunnah constantly and persistently express that which gives nothing but presumptions of hardcore <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (thanks <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>for being revealingly honest about it</a>)! For the revealed texts say "Allah is above" repeatedly and consistently, and coherently, and we say this is kufr and it is so because according to Aristotle's maqoolaat, aboveness is an incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) of bodies (ajsaam), so it would mean Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) which is kufr. Hallowed be the intellectual proof which saved us from this misguidance.</div>    <P>
This concludes the second of the three issues, now we move on to the third and hotly contested issue:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying Attributed To the Ash'aris: There is No Prophet In the Grave (Meaning He is No Longer A Prophet)</font>    <P>
To follow inshaa'Allaah.   <P>
