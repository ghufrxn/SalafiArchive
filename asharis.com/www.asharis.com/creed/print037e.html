<div class='sidebar'>There were from the Hanbalis those who despite ascribing to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> deviated from his way in numerous directions. They wrongly thought that what they were upon was from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. This deviation that occurred from these Hanbalis is used politically by the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of our times with a number of objectives. <b>The first</b> is to broadly brush those who hold onto the aqidah of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> which is identical to that of the entirety of the Salaf, the As.hab ul-Hadith, the Ahl al-Athar of the first 300 years, as being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>. <b>The second</b> is to portray the aqidah of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with other than what it truly was. In this brief series we will look at this matter in more detail and expose the fraud and treachery of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> in this regard.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Hanbalis Who Erred</font>    <P>
As for these Hanbalis, they are: <b>Abu Abdullah bin Hamid</b> (d. 403H), <b>Abu al-Hasan al-Tamimi</b>, <b>Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi</b> (d. 410H), <b>Rizqullah al-Tamimi</b> (d.448H), <b><a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a></b> (d. 453H) and his son, <b>Ibn Abi Ya'laa</b>,  <b>Ibn Aqeel</b> (d. 513H), <b>Abu al-Hasan Ibn al-Zaghuni</b> (d. 527H) and <b>Ibn    al-Jawzee</b> (d.597H). All of these had something of departure, <u>in large, small, or negligible amounts</u>, from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and they attributed (directly or indirectly) to the creed of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> that which was not from the creed of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. It is interesting to note that many of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who came afterwards relied upon the likes of these scholars in order to characterize some of the viewpoints of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and they were in error in this regard, particularly on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Their Errors</font>    <P>
As for the errors of these Hanbalis then they are:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b>ONE:</b> Adopting some of the usul of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in relation to the chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>). Exaggeration in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) of the attributes, and the use of fabricated narrations relating to the attributes. Falling into tafwid. These occurred from Abu Ya'laa (kalaam, <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a>, tafwid, affirmation of fabricated narrations),  and exaggeration in affirmation occurred from Ibn Haamid, and Ibn al-Zaghuni was similarly influenced by <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (he in turn affected Ibn Aqil).     <P>
<b>TWO:</b> Departing from <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) somewhat and entering into something of the language of Ahl al-Kalaam (the Tamimis). Some of these Tamimis (Abu al-Fadl) had close associations with the likes of al-Baqillaani, the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, and they ascribed to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> certain statements which are not direct statements of Imaam Ahmad's speech but something they ascribed to him which was statements of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and this is rejectd and all the well-known direct students of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> never narrated anything like that from him. But these statements were popularized through <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and others and they come through the likes of Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi.     <P>
<b>THREE:</b> Falling into tajahhum and i'tizaal with respect to the attributes (Ibn Aqil, Ibn al-Jawzee).</blockquote>    <P>
That such errors should occur from the Hanbalis is not surprising given the fact that those who ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik and Shafi'ee had much greater deviations. Take for example the <u>Hanafi Mu'tazilah</u>, the <u>Hanafi Jahmiyyah</u>, the <u>Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>, just by way of example.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>O and don't forget, that <u>Qaraamitee Baatinee Kafir</u> called <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> was also a Hanafi(!), yet <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) is free of all these deviants, just as He is free of the Maturidis who ascribe their Jahmee, I'tizaalee, Kullaabee creed to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> who is free of the aqidah of Abu Mansur al-Maturidi that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created (as he indicates in his Kitab al-Tawhid), and who never made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of anything of Allaah's attributes, and who condemned the sayings of Ahl al-Kalaam, the speech of <u>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</u> (bodies and their incidental attributes) as nothing but the sayings of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and how truthful andprecise he was and this was in the first half of the second century(!!) 250 years before the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and about 400 years before the Matureedees <u>were even known as a faction</u>!</div>    <P>
So that something of deviation occurred from those ascribing to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is not unusual, and there even those who ascribed to the Prophets, whilst the Prophets are free of them and what they claim, such as the Qaraamitah and Baatiniyyah. That people who are in error should ascribe their way to promiment people, Prophets or otherwise, is nothing unusual and none of that can be used to revile, or mischaracterize, either the religion (if it is ascription to a Prophet) or the sound creed (if it is an Imaam from the established, firmly-grounded Imaams of the Sunnah from the era of the righteous Salaf in the first three hundred years).     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Taymiyyah on These Hanbalis</font>    <P>
Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in Majm&#363;&#703; al-Fat&#257;w&#257; (6/54):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is no doubt that the Ash&#703;arites of Khuras&#257;n had deviated towards ta&#703;&#7789;&#299;l, and many of the &#7716;anbal&#299;s increased in affirmation.</blockquote>    <P>
The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> receded away from the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and fell into the ta'til of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (learn about that <a href=index7701.html?llmom>here</a>), and likewise amongst the Hanbalis who increased in affirmation of that which was repugnant and founded upon fabricated and weak narrations. This is most represented in <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a>. Imaam <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> said of him in Siyar A&#703;l&#257;m al-Nubul&#257;, (18/91):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He (Abu Ya&#703;l&#257;) did not have great experience in the knowledge of &#7717;ad&#299;th, and perhaps he used weak narrations as proof.</blockquote>    <P>
In his attempts to refute the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Mutakallimin like <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H), <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a> authored <i>Ibtaal al-Ta'wilaat</i>, and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in this regard in <i>Dar' al-Ta&#703;&#257;ru&#7693; al-&#703;Aql wal-Naql</i> (5/237-238):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And whilst he connected (the chains) of the &#257;&#7717;&#257;d&#299;th he mentioned, and also mentioned their narrators, there are many fabricated &#257;&#7717;&#257;d&#299;th therein, such as the &#7717;ad&#299;th of the [Prophet's] seeing [All&#257;h] with the eyes on the night of the ascent [of the Prophet] and its likes. And also within them are things from some of the Salaf, which some of the people reported in marf&#363;&#703; form , such as the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) sitting on <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, some of the people have narrated this through many routes of transmission in marf&#363;&#703; form, but all of them are fabricated ... for this reason and others, Rizqull&#257;h al-Tam&#299;m&#299; [d. 448H] and others from the [later] associates of A&#7717;mad spoke against al-Q&#257;&#7693;&#299; Ab&#363; Ya&#703;l&#257;'s authorship of this book with very harsh words, and his enemies poured scorn upon him on account of things he was innocent of, as he mentioned at the end of the book.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that these Scholars who were attached to hadith, like Abu Ya'laa were not as skilled, grounded and qualified like the Imaams of the Hadeeth in the golden era of hadeeth two centuries earlier, and thus they were not able to distinguish like those before them were able. As a result, although Abu Ya'laa had much truth with him in this book and aided the way of Ahl al-Sunnah and As.haab al-Hadeeth, he included certain narrations for which his opponents attacked him. In addition he was affected by the kalam of the mutakallimin based upon their proof of huduth al-ajsaam and this was reflected in his changing views on <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and likewise in his position on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Hanbalis Affected by I'tizaal and Tajahhum</font>    <P>
In response there were from the Hanbalis who rejected this from Abu Ya'laa, and they were the likes of Rizqullah al-Tamimi, Ibn Aqeel, and afterwards Ibn al-Jawzee. However from these Hanbalis were those who inclined towards tajahhum and i'tizaal, in particular Ibn Aqeel and Ibn al-Jawzee. As for Ibn Aqeel he was affected by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and his Shaykhs include Abu Alee Ibn Waleed and  Abu al-Qasim bin al-Tibyaan, <u>both Mu'tazilees</u>.     <P>
Im&#257;m al-Dhahab&#299; in his biographical account (see <i>al-Siyar</i> 19/443-451) quotes Ibn &#703;Aq&#299;l as saying, "And our associates, the &#7716;anbal&#299;s desired from me to boycott a group amongst the scholars, and that would have prevented me from beneficial knowledge," and al-Dhahab&#299; commented on this saying,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They used to prohibit him from sitting with the Mu&#703;tazilah, but he refused, until he fell into their snares and ventured into making ta&#702;w&#299;l of the texts, we ask All&#257;h for safety.</blockquote>    <P>
As for Ibn al-Jawzee he was confused and muddled, and was affected by the i'tizaal of Ibn Aqeel and had tajahhum with him too. He had many contradictory positions on the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and thus he is matrook in this subject. Ibn al-Jawzee wrote a refutation, <i>Daf' Shubhah al-Tashbih</i>, against those earlier Hanbalis like Abu Ya'laa and Ibn al-Zaghuni and Ibn Haamid, and their excess in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation), however, this refutation was from <u>a Jahmee, Mu'tazilee perspective</u>. And just like those earlier Hanbalis like Abu Ya'laa received something of rejection and scorn, likewise Ibn al-Jawzee received widespread condemnation from the leading Hanbalis of the time, as is documented by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in Dhayl Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah. Abu al-Fadl Ubaydallah al-Althiyy wrote to Ibn al-Jawzee, on behalf of the Hanbalis, and within his letter to him there occurs:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that the rejection of the Scholars, the esteemed ones, and the best of those in the horizons against you has increased, on account ofyour corrupt sayings regarding the Attributes, and they have clarified the weakness in your saying, and they quote about you that you rejected the advice...    <P>
So how is permissible for you to follow the mutakallimin in their views, and dispute with those who dispute in that which they disputed, and then you show rejection against them. This is from the amazing, strange affairs. And if a created being described another with attributes without direct vision or a truthful report, he would have been a liar in his information. So how can you (people) describe All&#257;h, the Sublime, with something, whose authenticity you have not come across. Rather, (how can you speak) based upon mere presumptions, and happenings, and you negate the Attributes that He is pleased with for Himself, and [which] His Prophet related about Him, through the narration of firm, trustworthy narrators?...    <P>
So beware O pauper, before death (comes to you), and rectify your speech and action, for the appointed time has come, to All&#257;h belongs the affair, from before and after, there is no power nor might except by All&#257;h, the Most-High, the Mighty.</blockquote>    <P>
As for Abu Ya'laa, while he certainly had much for which he ought to be criticised, he was also slandered and lied upon based upon dubious narrations, and some of these were carried by Abu Bakr bin al-'Arabi through unknown reporters in his book al-'Awaasim min al-Qawaasim.    <P>
In short we can broadly divide these Hanbalis into three categories:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b>The first</b>: Those affected by kalam and the Kullaabi usool who also exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation), so they spoke with sayings similar to those of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, but exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>. Some of them also delved into something of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafwid.    <P>
<b>The second:</b> Those affected by the Jahmi Mu'tazili <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and tahreef, although Ibn Aqeel repented from that at the end of his life, and Ibn al-Jawzee was confused and muddled with no consistency at all in any of his writings combining between tajahhum and i'tizaal and in some areas agreeing with Ahl al-Sunnah. He criticized not only Ahl al-Sunnah but also the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics on their position on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
<b>The third:</b> Those affected by <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> due to their association with the Ahl al-Kalam from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and this includes the Tamimis, such as Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi and Rizqullah al-Tamimi.  </blockquote>    <P>
Each of these groups ascribed their way or particular views to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is free of all groups - even if some of them were much closer to the truth than others. For the first two groups had ghuluww, either in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) or in nafy (negation), just as they also had with them <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> (tahrif) and tafwid that Imam Ahmad was free of. The likes of Abu Ya&#703;l&#257; misrepresented the way of Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad in the subject of the Qur&#702;&#257;n and the &#7779;if&#257;t fi&#703;liyyah, upon the principles of Ibn Kull&#257;b, just as they exaggerated in affirmation in relation to the &#7779;&#299;f&#257;t khabariyyah. Ibn al-Jawzee took the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Imaam Ahmad affirmed the attributes <u>with their meanings</u> and denied tashbih and takyif for <u>their realities</u>, otherwise if this not the case, then for exactly what was the battle raging for almost two hundred years between Ahl al-Sunnah and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> between 110H to 300H? It was the indication of the texts to meanings that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> considered tashbih and tajsim! And the Salaf refuted them by saying that there is nothing of tashbih in what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him, that tashbih is only when it is said, "hearing like my hearing, knowledge like my knowledge, hand like my hand" and that the texts are to be passed on exactly as they have come, without tafsir, sifah, hadd, ma'naa and kayf (<a href=index291b.html?vxilx>see this article</a>). </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Monopolize on the Above History To Propagandize for Their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of al-Jawhar wal-<a href="tags/arad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">'arad</font></a></font>    <P>
Before looking at the actual methodology of the contemporary <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in making political use of the above history, there are some background points that have to be kept in mind. They are as followss:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b>Point 1:</b> As we have established in many articles on this site, the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in their ta'til and left the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a>, and this is demonstrated clearly in the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. So when they see what occurred to some amongst the Hanbalis, they take it as an opportunity to call to, justify and defend their creed. We mean here not the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, but the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> taken by the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
<b>Point 2:</b> Abu Ya'laa no doubt had a lot of truth with him, since he supported the generality of the way of the Salaf, except that he had a type of baatil (falsehood) which is exaggeration in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>, as a result of which the Ash'aris, in particular the Qushayris (father and son), criticized him and likewise Rizqullah al-Tamimi who was an "Ash'arified" Hanbali (as was Abu Ya'laa himself for a period), and in this those Ash'aris had a type of truth with them, even if in general, they were upon much baatil (ilm al-kalam, ta'til, tahrif). In addition to this, when those Hanbalis who came later, like Ibn al-Jawzee, wrote critiques of the likes of Abu Ya'laa upon Jahmee Mu'tazilee perspectives, this became an ideal opportunity for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to misrepresent the actual way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>.    <P>
<b>Point 3:</b> We also have to bear in mind here that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> know full well, through experience in history that the fitrah upon which Allaah created mankind is averse to the language and terminology and classification  that the Mutakallimun took from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers, which is the language of ajsaam and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and a language that describes Allaah is "<i>not a body, not a subjstance, not an incidental attribute, not above, nor below, not within, not without, not in place, not in direction, not in spacial occupation...</i>" We have established that <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. d. 429H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) have all explicitly wrote about this, acknowledged it, as a result of which they propose a type of conniving and deception, in the way that the average people are addressed in matters of their faith. Read these articles (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a>,<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>here</a> and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit >here</a>).    <P>
<b>Point 4:</b> That the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> that the Salaf and the <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> condemned were those who likened Allah's essence (dhat) to the physical body of humans, in flesh and blood, and thus gave him the limbs of the creation, and these were the Raafidee Ahl al-Kalaam such as Hisham bin al-Hakam, the Rafidee Mutakallim. And likewise Hisham bin Salim al-Jawaaleeqi and Dawud al-Jawaaribee and others. Also the Hanafi Karramiyyah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who said their Lord was a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) [some of them said "<i>but not like the created bodies</i>"], and they delved into the <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of Allah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and spoke with repugnant affairs. Note that all of these were Ahl al-Kalaam. As for those who affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah, like face, hands, eyes and also affirmed Allaah  Himself to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then they are the entirety of the Salaf and the early Kullabiyyah <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> as is established without dispute. And this is acknowledged by the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and mentioned in their works (<a href=index4be3.html?ljaow>see this article</a>) and they never included these factions as amongst the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>. Rather those who accused these affirmers as <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> refuted them in this regard.    <P>
<b>Point 5:</b> That the likes of Abu Ya'laa fell into what they fell into due to their not being grounded in the field of hadith and so they affirmed baseless narrations and upon the sound principle of affirming for Allaah what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him, they affirmed repugnant baseless matters for Allaah, the Most Highm through such baseless narrations. And so they were not <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> nor <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> in the real sense of the word - like the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Shafi'i Kurdish <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> -  but they fell into what is blameworthy and what is no doubt worthy of criticism through a route other than the route of the actual <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, who from the outset, claimed their Lord is a human in flesh and blood with limbs or is a body like the bodies, or a body unlike other bodies. In any case, he fell into what is repugnant and rejected.     <P>
<b>Point 6:</b> And this is one of their inner core secrets - wihch is that the later <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> actually are resentful of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and their activities in using the likes of the Hanbalis that are the subject of this article and their aberrations is simply a stepladder to indirectly attack <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and to belittle his great position as the greatest of the Imaams of the Sunnah and as the one who saved the Islamic aqidah from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. This is in order to propagate their spurious claim that they were the saviours of Islaam - and <u>out of fairness and justice</u> whilst the early Kullabi Ash'aris <u>in particular</u> like <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> are indeed commended for what they presented of refutations against the factions and religions, the approach they inherited from the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups of the seond century hijrah (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - huduth al-ajsaam) only <u>opened the door for the enemies of Islam</u> like al-Farabi and <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and the Qaraamitah Baatiniyyah to use what the Mutakallimin were doing to the Sharee'ah texts in relation to the Names and Attributes (which is tahrif, distortion, in the name of "<a href="tags/tawil.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'wil</font></a>", in order to comply with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam) as a justification to apply the same to the texts relating to <u>creation, resurrection, the angels, and the sharee'ah commands</u> - so they said to the Ahl al-Kalaam: Just like you consider the texts relating to belief in Allaah's attributes to be metaphors, and that is the greatest pillar of belief, then it is even more justified that what is less than that, such as belief in creation, resurrection, angels, revelation and the likes is also just metaphor, and likewise prayer, fasting, hajj and so on. So as the saying goes, "<i>Neither Islam did they aid and nor the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> did they destroy</i>," yet they continue in their self-praise, aggrandisement and bigotry of claiming to have saved Islam, when all they did was poisoned themselves with philosophy and opened the door for Islam's enemies. So coming back to our point regarding <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, when <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> subdued the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who were the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups, there arose the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, Harith al-Muhasibee, and al-Karaabeesee and they entered into the snares of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and got put to trial in the  issue of Allaah's chosen actions (af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah, <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'liyyah). And <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was <u>very, very, very</u> severe against them. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> knew the inner core and reality of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> so when this faction emerged he knew exactly what it would entail and what would result from it - the revival of the din of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created.  This was from his perspicacity. And yes, which faction emerged championing this particular way? The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who  simply carried the usool of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> of negating Allaah's chosen actions, from which is Allaah's speech and which  would inevitably lead to the saying that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was created. Just take a look here, they actually admit that they believe that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> about which the Salaf said "uncreated" is "created"  (see   <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a>, <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>here</a>, <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>here</a> and <a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>here</a>) from their own writings! So, the way that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon is <u>antithetical and contradictory</u> to the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and this is why they blot out that history, and give it no merit, or acknowledgement, that history which is the trial of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and his stance against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. So these <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> who agree with al-Ja'd bin Dirham, <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, Amr bin Ubayd, Bishr al-Mareesee and their likes that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, are deeply resentful of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, despite what they try to portray outwardly. For this reason, all of this commotion that you see from them regarding some of those Hanbalis who indeed erred in the matter of excessive affirmation, and using other Hanbalis who erred in the other direction, is simply a means of trying to attack the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> itself and to distort it and misrepresent it, and to make the people averse to identifying the truth that was with the Hanbali scholars who remained firmly and staunchly upon what <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was upon, which is nothing but what Imaam al-Shaafi'ee and Imaam Maalik and Imaam <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and the other leading Imaams of the Salaf were upon, like al-Awzaa'ee, al-Thawree, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn Uyainah, Ishaq bin Raahuyah and countless others.     <P>
</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The War of the Worlds</font>    <P>
With the above points established lets look at the methodology of the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics of our time:    <P>
<b><u>The First Step</u></b>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/mujassimah-landed.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0><b>The first step</b> is to cultivate <u>intellectual terrorism</u>, which is instilling shock and awe in the minds and hearts of the people. You can liken this to the "War of the Worlds" broadcast on Sunday night, 30th October 1938 in the US. This was an adaptation of a book by H.G Wells, and millions of people heard it and hundreds of thousands actually thought it was real thinking that nasty, ferocious Martians were coming to Earth. So the first step the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> must use by necessity is to terrify their potential audience with their own "radio broadcast" [read lectures, forums, blogs, the tube, podcasts etc.] by portraying that those evil, nasty <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> with their evil tajsim have landed and have come to "get you." Of course, the average, unassuming, knowledge-lacking Muslim is going to fall for this drama. Scared and terrified out of his wits, and looking over his shoulder in case a nasty Mujassim is stalking him, the average Muslim is looking for protection.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now your shrewd <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> propagandist knows well that if the common person was to hear on the radio, "<i>Not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makan, not in tahayyuz, not above, not below, not outside, not inside</i>..." the average Muslim, through his fitrah, will know that this <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> propagandist has been smoking something. Informed people will know that to be the terminology, language and rational proof of the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers from whom al-Ja'd bin Dirham and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> acquired their theology [of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad and the proof of huduth al-ajsaam], subsequently taken up by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and refined by them, and then it came into the laps of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who then founded their theology upon it, whils differing with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> only on what they considered to be the binding necessities that follow on from this proof. So the average Muslim ain't buying that <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> - and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> admitted it explicitly - (see <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a>,<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>here</a> and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit >here</a>).</div>    <P>
<b><u>The Second Step</u></b>    <P>
So when you have the average Muslim in shock and awe through that intellectual terrorism, <b>the second step</b> is now to compound the matter and to monopolize upon that raw fear, awe and terror that has just been created and to give it some credibility, because although people lose their wits through sudden intense fear, their senses do come back to them, so you've got to now build some credibility. And so enter "<i>Daf' Shubhah al-Tasbhih</i>", the book of Ibn al-Jawzee written from a Jahmee Mu'tazili perspective against those Hanbalis who exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>. And for sure, those Hanbalis are worthy of criticism and rebuke, but not from a Jahmee, Mu'tazilee perspective. Rather from a Sunni, Athari perspective, which is that they are rebuked for their lack of skill and expertise in a field as a result of which they fell into such repugnant errors, the consequence of which was to bring disrepute to the Hanbali madhhab, and give the opposers an opportunity to throw the accusation of tajsim and tashbih against the Hanbalis at large, and to taint and stain them with  these matters.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics do lecture series going through this book of Ibn al-Jawzee in which there is a type of truth but in the context of much baatil (tajahhum, i'tizaal) and it is a tool as part of the overall propaganda to distance people away from the creed of the Salaf and the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> and to cause confusion regarding it and about the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. And this is almighty strange, how come you are using a Hanbali book, which is not even basic text on creed (unlike the books of Ibn al-Bannaa al-Hanbali, Abdul-Ghaniyy al-Maqdisi and Ibn Qudaama al-Maqdisi), as a means of laying the foundations for your creed, this does not make sense. </div>    <P>
But of course it is of <u>propagandistic value</u> in order to make their own creed of "<i>Not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makan, not in tahayyuz, not above, not below, not outside, not inside</i>..." more palatable later on, when the average Muslim has been duped by them. So this is from the treachery, dishonesty and conniving of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> knowing that their own theology of ajsaam and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> is rejected by the fitrah of mankind. Instead of using Ibn al-Jawzee why don't they go to standard Hanbali texts such as Ibn al-Bannaa al-Hanbalis <i>al-Mukhtaar Fee Usul al-Sunnah</i> and what is similar to it, which presents the true Sunni, Salafi, Athari aqidah of Ahmad bin Hanbal and all the Imams of the Salaf? So this is from their conniving and scheming no doubt.    <P>
<b><u>The Third Step</u></b>    <P>
This now takes us to <b>the third step</b> which is to use texts like those of al-Tahawi and in particular certain parts of it such as the negation of limbs, parts, confinement by directions and the likes, and all of these are in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who said Allaah is in all places, and of the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and of the Hanafi Karramiyyah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Shafi'i Kurdish <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and their likes. This is not a refutation of the entirety of the Salaf and the Kullabi Ash'aris who held Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and affirmed the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, like face, hands eyes, and likewise the attributes of pleasure and anger (with the Salaf affirming them as sifat fi'liyyah, and the Kullabiyyah affirming them as eternal attributes). However, their aim here is to deceive the victim into thinking that what the Salaf and the early Kullabi Ash'aris were upon is in fact tajsim and tashbih. Texts like al-Tahawi's whose wording is often general and obscure serves this purpose of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in their propaganda. Thus, they try to misappropriate this creed, by giving it attention, focus, translating it, publishing it, with their own doctrinal bias. See examples of this from Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx >in this article</a>). You will notice that these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> will never ever take any texts prior to 300H, despite the fact that there are scores and scores of texts preserved from the Imaams of the Sunnah, be they simple affirmation of the creed, or be they refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. You can see a large list of such texts <a href=indexfc13.html?zycga>in this article</a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the Salaf, they take this entire body of literature together, and through it as a whole they see <u>a consistent, congruent, uniform, coherent creed and methodology</u> which is in stark contrast to what the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon of their theology built upon the language of  al-ajsaam and al-a'rad. You will <u>NEVER, EVER</u> see a cowardly <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretic venture into this era (before 300H) and take this approach regarding the sum whole of the literature from the Imaams of the Salaf written specifically on issues of creed and in refutation of the schools of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<b><u>The Fourth Step</u></b>    <P>
This now takes us to <b>the fourth step</b> and here we get a little deep. After the first three steps, there has be a level of sophistication involved for the shrewder ones who have been caught in the snares, and this is by using statements in specific issues through <u>decontextualization</u> and this is best illustrated with an example, the example of al-'uluww.  As for the view of Ahl al-Sunnah:    <P>
<blockquote><p>The Salaf as a whole in their entirety affirm three types of 'uluww for Allaah, that Allaah is above His creation Himself, (uluww al-dhaat), that Allaah is above His creation in rank, status (qadr) and that Allaah is above His creation in terms of domination (uluww al-qahr). This is undisputed and established without any doubt, anyone who challenges this is a kadhhaab (liar), a lying scoundrel, lacking honesty and justice. </blockquote>    <P>
Then amongst the Ahl al-Kalaam, there are two views:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b>First</b>: Those who affirmed these three types of 'uluww for Alaah, and they are the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> and the Karraaamiyyah. As for the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, they already held that Allaah is <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and following on from this they delved into the takyif of 'uluww and al-istiwaa' and started saying that Allaah is touching <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that He fills <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He has a limit in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He has no limits in all other directions, and some of them said that Allaah is separate from <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> by an infinite distance and others said otherwise - and so this was a repugnant type of takyif from them. In response to these Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the Kullabiyyah and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> had statements of refutation, alongside affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and so they would say that Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> but is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without touch (mummaassah) - and  this particular statement was held even some of the Imaams of the Salaf like Abu Nasr al-Sijzee (d. 444H) - so they said the likes of these statements, and also that Allaah is neither said to be a great distance away from <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> nor adjacent to it, and the intent in all of this was to rebut the takyif of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, but certainly not to oppose what the Salaf were united upon that Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, separate and distinct from the creation. And in this regard we have mentioned their sayings on this site such as <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, besides what is known from <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Harith al-Muhaasibee and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<b>Second</b>: The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> all say that Allaah is neither within the universe nor outside the universe and can neither be said to be above or below or in front or behind and the likes. This saying actually emanates from the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that Allaah is in every place. Then as Ahl al-Sunnah refuted them and exposed their falsehood to the common folk and the common folk knew of their falsehood, they began to say that what they really mean is that Allaah is not within things or outside of things and from this came the saying that Allaah is neither within the universe nor outside of it, and this was championed by kafirs like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 439H) and was later taken up by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who came after like <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H).</blockquote>    <P>
Once all of this is understood, we can now grasp the type of method used by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> not just in this particular example but in many other issues of creed as well, such as in the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, its called <u>decontextualization</u>, so this is how it works.     <P>
<blockquote><p>They use the statements of the Kullabiyyah <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> where they negate mumassah (touch) and remoteness and nearness to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - all of which was a rebuttal of the takyif of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> AFTER agreement upon the foundation which is Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - and then apply them to Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah who hold Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. In this manner they cause confusion, doubt and obfuscation about this particular belief. In this way, they attempt to erode this belief slowly and with subtelty.</blockquote>    <P>
Remember, these <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics we have present today are not following the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, they are followin kafirs like <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> and kafirs like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> like <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> who followed the doctrines of those kafirs in this particular issue (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit >see proof right here</a>) - and of course the greatest obstacle to their theology is what is rooted in the hearts and minds (in the fitrah) of all of mankind that Allaah is above His creation. This innate belief clashes with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam which they took from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers who were versed in the study of natural sciences and - being far from Prophethood - devised their proof to demonstrate the universe is originated using the classification and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad (bodies and their incidental attributes).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Layer Cake</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/layer-cake.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0>So the point here is that we have a layered approach, like layers in a cake, and so we start with the <b>first layer</b> intellectual terrorism, shock and awe, and everyone is terrified of those evil nasty Mujassims who have landed and are going to gobble you up, this layer has got to be thick and firm. Once that is in place we then build upon it, and along comes the <b>second layer</b> Ibn Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzee who were <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> and Mu'tazilite in <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, so they provide the corroboration, and no doubt this deceives many an uninformed individual. Then we have the <b>third layer</b>, which is to give this further credibility and use texts such as al-Tahawi's creed which have a certain value to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, even if al-Tahawi's creed is antithetical to theirs as is clear from his affirmation of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> as true and real created entity and Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, and affirmation of the sifat fi'liyyah such as anger and pleasure, and speaking to Moses and taking Ibrahim as a friend, and likewise on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that it originated with Allaah as His actual speech and so on. But there are some generalized obscure statements they find of utility and which they misunderstand and misapply, so this is the third layer. Finally, <b>the fourth layer</b>, which is embellishment, and here we see them taking liberties in some intricate matters where the average person will be unaware, so they <u>decontextualize statements across of variety of subjects</u> and then use them wrongly, so they take these statements and embellish the cake with them. The onlooker no doubt is stupefied, his mouth is watering, and he wants his slice of the action, and he wants it right now!    <P>
<blockquote><p><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>So this is how the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics entice followers. However, this cake is laced, <u>and it is laced with that ilm al-kalaam that the Salaf condemned</u>, the ilm al-kalaam which is the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad and the corrupt proof of huduth al-ajsaam. So the unsuspecting Muslim, after having  been intellectually terrorized, then wooed with the cake, is finally laced, and now its the perfect time to bring on the heavies, the real stuff, the Jawharahs and the Umm al-Baraaheens and the likes and here we will be getting that hardcore ilm al-kalaam, the legacy of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> upon which the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> built their theology, and so now there are absolutely no barriers to start teaching the real stuff, the intent all along, "<i>not a body, not a subjstance, not an incidental attribute, not above, nor below, not within, not without, not in place, not in direction, not in spacial occupation...</i> - which is simply an extension of the "negative theology" which came from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers based upon  their study of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad which became the foundation of the theology of the Mutakallimin, whose ilm al-kalam (in proving the universe is originated) is the very kalam of those pagan <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> as been stated by both Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and Abu Sulayman al-Khattaabi.    <P>
And thus, will you understand the saying of the great Shafi'i Imaam, Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) who said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "Dhamm ul-Kalaam" and as mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>":    <P>
