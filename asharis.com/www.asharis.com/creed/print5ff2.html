<p>All praise is due to Allah and may the prayers and salutations be upon  His Messenger to proceed:    <P>
This is the first in a series of "Sunni Answers to Jahmee Claims" - being an exposition of the frauds perpetrated by 21st century <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as followers of <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>,  those who use "<a href="tags/kalam-atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalam <a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a></font></a>" as an intellectual foundation for passing judgement upon the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and rejecting the attributes through what was pioneered of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> by <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (ex. 128H) and Bishr al-Mareesee (d. 218H) - the deniers of there being a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important:</b> We have to distinguish between the genuine <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a>, who had knowledge, trustworthiness, integrity and dignity - despite their errors in creed on account of the <a href='tags/kalam-atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalam <a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a></font></a> they made to be the foundation of their religion - so we distinguish between them and between the latecomers of the 21st century who make an open display of deception, treachery, and outright fraud in knowledge and in discussion with the opponent. Hatred of a people does not allow you to fabricate upon them meanings that they did not speak with. </div>    <P>
So after this differentiation between genuine Ash'aris who show honesty and integrity and between fraudsters and deceivers, then we wish to discipline a neo-Jahmite who has let loose his vile tongue against Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, accusing him of ascribing "divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>)" to Allaah, and then making takfir of him.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Note that in this document, we will be referring to Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far ar-Raazee (d. after 200H) who, using his sandal, pounded a relative of his who was affected with the views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see  here</a>), and he is not to be confused with Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee (d. 606H), the Imaam of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, if and when we refer to the latter simply as "ar-Raazee".</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Claim Against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> Regarding Allaah Being <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (And Composite)</font>    <P>
So here it is, here is the crime and the fraud perpetrated in broad daylight ...    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-allaah-place-divisible-claim.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Now here, walillaahil-hamd, this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> - with all the delusions of self-grandeur in his occupation as a 21st century pro-Ash'arite kalam atomist - has just displayed phenomenal heights of pseudo-scholarship and pseudo-intelligence and he has understood from the above text what is not even in it - this is because <u>he does not even know the context of the discussion</u> or <u>who is saying what</u> - the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were always a primitive species, their sentiments racing ahead of their limited intellects. Because of his compound ignorance, he's read into the statement something which is as far from what the text actually means as is the earth from the heaven.     <P>
And this is besides the fact that his translation of the words of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, <u>which he has battered and butchered mercilessly almost to death through his gross incompetence of the Arabic language</u>, is screaming out for the life-support machine and from rescue from the hands of this oppressive <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, so we will have to rescue it from this criminal, revive it and repair it inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>For a full translation of the text in question from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and for relevant comments, please go to the end of the article. Everything from this point onwards and before our commentary upon this particular quote from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is to lay the background and foundations to help us understand what is the subject of the discussion. It is advisable that you have some patience and read through everything - as this will give you a good grasp of this Jahmee doubt and also an appreciation of the levels of depravity to which <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> will stoop in order to attack the creed of the Salaf - the Salaf who unanimously agreed upon Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence (see <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>here</a>, <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>here</a> and <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>).</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Takfir of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> Based Upon the Jahmee Baleed's Own Crippled Intellect</font>    <P>
This individual, on the same page, makes takfir of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) - based on the claim he has made against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. And there are other claims too which inshaa'Allaah we can address in separate articles. But here is what he said on the same page:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-allaah-place-divisible-claim-takfir.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Hence, it is necessary to discipline this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> with the establishment of the hujjah (proof) against him and bayaan (explanation) of the truth in this matter.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The 21st Century Kalam Atomist's Scandal</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah-1.gif align=right border=1 hspace=5 border=0> First a little background: "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>" is a monumental work of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that lays to waste the attempt of the Imaam of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Raazee to negate Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, using a mixture of the doubts of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>,  Mu'tazilites, the theories of <a href='tags/kalam-atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalam <a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a></font></a> (and a bit of Aristotle's wisdom thrown in for good measure). The book of Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Raazee is called "Asaas ut-Taqdees".    <P>
A 10 volume print edition (pictured) of the "Bayaan" was released three years ago in 1426H (around 2006) and prior to this, a summary 2 volume print edition was available, published over 35 years ago in 1392H (Makkah), and whose verifier is Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Qaasim.    <P>
This is an incomplete, summarised print of the entire "Bayaan", and in places the verifier - where Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Raazee brings one of his doubts which are not directly addressed in the "Bayaan", Shaykh al-Qaasim - provides a reply to the doubt by summarizing, or bringing quotes from other parts which are specifically related to that particular doubt.     <P>
The following explanation in the introduction by Shaykh Abdul-Azeez ar-Raajihee is found in the introductory volume (Qism ud-Diraasah) of the 10 volume print in explanation of the above:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah-2.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... the esteemed Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Qaasim, may Allaah grant him success, released in print, with verification, what amounts to one-half of the book, and he added to it replies from other books of Shaykh ul-Islaam against the doubts brought by ar-Raazee in his book "Ta'sees ut-Taqdees", which he (al-Qaasim) never found in the book "Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah Fee Ta'sees Bida'ihim al-Kalaamiyyah" and he called this (action of his) tahqeeq (verification) and takmeel (completion).</blockquote>    <P>
The section that this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has quoted from the 2 volume print (as evidence and justification for his slander of Ibn Taymiyyah) -  is a summary and mere reference to what has already preceded of the refutation of the argument of Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee that:     <P>
<blockquote><u>If Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, He would be occupying space (hayyiz), [and therefore] a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) subject to divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>), [and therefore] composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) and also subject to need (iftiqaar)</u> and as such, on this basis, <u>it is impossible</u> for Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is the argument of Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee against Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - this is his (rational) argument as to why Allaah cannot be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and in this ar-Raazee is in opposition to the early Imaams of the Ash'aris, like <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself and al-Baqillaani. He is arguing here for the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who were the first to negate there is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is refuting the arguments of ar-Raazee, showing them to be false and showing that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> does not necessitate the falsehoods that ar-Raazee is imposing upon the belief that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence. This is the wider context. And the verifier, Shaykh al-Qasim, has simply brought together a series of statements from other parts in the "Bayaan" in order to respond to this doubt.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Based upon the above, we previously stated in this article that the quoted words were that of the verifier of the 2 volume print of the "Bayaan" who may have paraphrased and summarized the words of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, taking from different sources - since we were not able to find the quoted text in the "Bayaan" or in any of the other works of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. However, after days and days of looking we found the quoted text in the 10 volume print (which consists of more than 5,000 pages!) - so it took us over a week to find it, and we have updated this article to reflect this fact.</div>    <P>
This particular passage in question is a summary of <u>a  rebuttal that spans hundreds of pages</u> against the arguments of ar-Raazee, and it is an indication of what has already preceded. The details of this will be covered in detail further in the article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Exposing The Jahmee Baleed's Treachery In Quotation: The First Strike</font>    <P>
Here's the first strike upon this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> that ought to make him flee on his heels with his head in between his legs ... (<a href=index0edf.html?bcnnu>and indeed he has</a>) ...    <P>
Take a look at this, its page 62 of ar-Raazee's "Asaas ut-Taqdees", published in Cairo, Egypt in 1986 (1406H) with the verification of Dr. Ahmad Hijaazee as-Saqaa:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-allaah-place-divisible-raazee-quote.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Look at the words indicated, "wa qad taqaddama ibtaaluhu", which means, "...its invalidation (i.e. rebuttal) has already preceded...". Our <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> thought these few words were the words of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, whereas in fact they are the words of ar-Raazee himself!!    <P>
Now if you look at Abu Adam Naruiji's article:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-allaah-place-divisible-claim-1st-section.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
You can see he is ascribing these few words, "...<i>wa qad taqaddama ibtaaluhu</i>..." to <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> when they are in fact, from the words of ar-Raazee, "<i>In kaana munqasiman, kaana murakkaban wa qad taqaddama ibtaaluhu</i>" that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is quoting.     <P>
Here is the the passage from the 3rd volume in the 10 volume print:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-440.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
You can see that Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is quoting the sentence of ar-Raazee, and the verifier of this volume from the "Bayaan" has indicated where quote is found in ar-Raazee's "Asaas ut-Taqdees" in the footnotes.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/house-demolition.gif align=right hspace=5 border=1 border=0> <b>So this shows that the Jahmee attacked <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> for a few words that are actually the words of his Imaam, Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Raazee! So in reality, he should be making this accusation against ar-Raazee!! </b>     <P>
But despite this grave (yet laughable) error of this pseudo-Shaykh, this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> that negates there is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it doesn't really fully reveal the full nature of his claim against Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
This only illustrates the pseudo-scholarship, and pseudo-intelligence of this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, it shows that he does not even know the arguments for his Jahmee creed as expounded by his scholars. It does not sufficiently answer the nature and reality of the overall claim he is making against Shaykh ul-Islaam from this passage he quoted.     <P>
Despite this, what we have just exposed this Jahmee for is enough to make repentance obligatory upon him - even though we have much more to bring to show the depravity, scandal, and ignominy of this individual in this claim of his.     <P>
<b><u>Ibn Taymiyyah Says That the Meanings of Taba''ud, Tajazzu', and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> (Meanings of Divisibility) Are Impossible For Allaah Because He is al-Ahad, as-Samad</u></b>    <P>
We find very clear and explicit statements from Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on the impossibility of the meanings of divisibility for Allaah in the "Bayaan", as an example (3/128-130) - (<a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>and you can refer to this article for more</a>).    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-128-130.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Here <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> states that the meanings of divisibility (al-inqisaam, at-tarkeeb etc.) are impossible for Allaah. <a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>For the translation of this quote, go to this article</a>.    <P>
And this is just an example of the kind of very explicit negation and denial by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that Allaah, the Sublime, is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) or <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>).     <P>
<b>The essence of the issue is that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> holds that Allaah is free of, and that it is impossible for Him to be munqasim (<a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>) or <a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a> (<a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>) with the well-known, established meanings of these words in the language of the Qur'aan and the language of the Arabs. </b>    <P>
<u>As for what the Innovators intend by employing these terms with their newly-devised meanings</u> - then all of them intend to negate something of what Allaah described Himself with - and through this argument they refute each other. So the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> refute the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmites, Mu'tazilites and Ash'arites), and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> refute the Mu'tazilites and the Mu'tazilites refute the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and so on - all based upon this same argument of "divisibility" and "composition". See further below for a full clarification of this matter.    <P>
Thus - before proceeding further - we say to this Jahmee Baleed:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Open Invitation to Recant, Apologize and Make Repentance - 3rd August 2009</font>    <P>
Before we proceed to utterly demolish and lay to waste - with Allaah's aid - this laughable attempt of the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> to feign piety and defense of the truth, we will extend him a bit of rope. At this stage, we will not bring out the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far ar-Raazee (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see the opening part to this article here</a>), and simply make a request and an open invitation to give the primitive <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> posing as an erudite <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> an opportunity to make amends and repent before exposing his fraud in detail and unleashing the sandal.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>A piece of advice to this individual and his likes</u>: If you want to propound Jahmee answers against the creed of the Salaf, at least try to be genuine and honest and do it with integrity and honesty and try to maintain a bit of dignity and self-respect in the process.</b></div>    <P>
You need to just back off and repent from this instance of  your slander upon Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, before all the disgraces and scandals of your statement are documented, laid bare, and made manifest for all to see. Remember the Qur'anic principle, hatred of a people does not allow you to oppress them by averting from justice in reproducing their words and statements with integrity, precision and with full contextual background.    <P>
So you have the opportunity to take back your fabrication, recant, repent and make amends ... the doors are open.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>In The Meanwhile, Let's Develop Our Context and Justification for Bringing Out the Sandal - Highlighting the Arguments of ar-Raazee</font>    <P>
While we wait for the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> to repent, we can, in the meanwhile, provide some background context, to help deepen the ditch which the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has already dug for himself.    <P>
Let's visit Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee's work "Asaas ut-Taqdees", a work written and directed towards the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and those whom ar-Raazee calls the Hanbaliyyah, and he accuses the Hanbaliyyah of affirming constituents (ajzaa') and parts (ab'aad) for Allaah, and what he means is the affirmation of Face, Hands and Eyes and other attributes which have come in the Book and the Sunnah - he considers this to be affirming constituents and parts for Allaah - and these Attributes are affirmed not just by the "Hanbaliyyah" but but also the Malikees, Shaafi'ees, Hanafees, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his followers, and likewise the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, like <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself and al-Baqillani and many other factions. So he frames his opponents as thought they are the "Hanbaliyyah", whereas in reality, his opponents are much more than just the "Hanbaliyyah".      <P>
So the book attempts to provide arguments as to why it cannot be said about Allaah that He is "above" and why it is not possible for Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>NOTE</b>: As indicated above, ar-Raazee portrays as if the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the "Hanbalis" are unique in affirming Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> since he treats them as his disputants - whereas in reality, his disputants are Allah, all His revealed Books, His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), the Companions as a whole, the Taabi'een and their followers and the Imaams of the religion therafter, such as Hammaad bin Zayd (d. 179H), Abdullaah bin al-Mubaarak (d. 181H), Fudayl bin Iyaad (d. 187H) and so on. And when the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> innovated their saying that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it was the Salaf such as those mentioned, who affirmed that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, with His Essence (<a href=index6afa.html?darjp>see here</a> and <a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>also here</a>), and they scorned, reviled and abused the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who innovated this statement. And <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> - considered an Ash'ari -  affirms that this (Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, separate and distinct from the creation) was indeed the view and position of the Salaf (see <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>here</a>, <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>, <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>here</a> and <a href=index7dc8.html?owrwl>here</a>).    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> then they said, "Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)", <a href=index264c.html?bolnh>and we covered previously in an article</a> that there were factions amongst the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who held Allaah was a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), but not like the created bodies. So ar-Raazee is addressing the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. And he is also addressing those whom he refers to as "Hanbalis" to whom he ascribes the view that they consider Allaah to be made up of constituents (ajzaa') and ab'aad (parts). The  statements of ar-Raazee that we will quote a little later are to be understood within this context.    <P>
It is also worth pointing that in opposition to the factions of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who said "<i>Allaah is above the <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) [but not like the created bodies]</i>", the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> like al-Baqillani said, "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>" (<a href=index7dc8.html?owrwl>see here</a>). So both affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, while opposing each other on the issue of the labelling with "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>". Thus, whilst ar-Raazee claims his disputants are the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the "Hanbaliyyah", his disputants are in fact much more than just them, rather they include the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (al-Ashariyyah al-Mutaqaddimoon). </div>    <P>
So what the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has quoted (on the basis of which he slanders Ibn Taymiyyah) is in reference to some particular arguments brought by ar-Raazee in his book "Asaas ut-Taqdees" - and we will quote the specific passages in question. We need to do this to provide <u>the full context</u> of this matter, and so that we can see the great depths of ignorance and deception of this individual and his likes.    <P>
First here is the cover of Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee's book, its published in Cairo, Egypt in 1986 (1406H) with the verification of Dr. Ahmad Hijaazee as-Saqaa:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/raazee-asaas-ut-taqdees-cover.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here we have on page 19-20 one of ar-Raazee's arguments:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/raazee-asaas-ishaarah-hiss-tajseem.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We can provide a summary of what ar-Raazee is saying and doing here. Basically ar-Raazee is attempting to prove that the saying "<i>Allaah is not merged with the creation and nor separate from it in any of the six directions</i>" is something that is <u>more instinctive, intuitive and self-evident</u> than the claim of the opponent that "<i>Allaah is One, free of assembly (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) and composition (ta'leef) and at the same time, He is not minute and insignificant</i>".  In other words, ar-Raazee claims: "<i>Allaah being neither inside the creation nor outside of it</i>" is a more readily-apparent truth to the average person, than "<i>Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> whilst being One (i.e. not subject to divisibility)</i>". This is the claim of ar-Raazee. Now, though this argument is addressing the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who say Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with factions of them <u>wrongly holding</u> that Allaah is also a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) but not like the created bodies (<a href=index264c.html?bolnh>see here</a>) - the argument ar-Raazee brings is applicable to all those who hold Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in any case, and this includes the entirety of the Salaf, and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early <a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Asharis</font></a></font></a> as well as many other factions (as indicated previously).    <P>
And his argument to demonstrate this is as follows:    <P>
<ul><li>That the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the Hanbalis must acknowledge the existence of something outside of what can ordinarily be judged to exist through sensory perception and imagination.  <li>As for the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, then when it is said to them that if Allaah could be pointed towards (al-mushaar ilayhi) then either He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, and thus composed (of parts, constituents etc.) - but the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> do not hold this - or He is not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, and as such He must be so small and insignificant, such as the size of the indivisible particle. But the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> don't speak with this either.  <li> And when either of these two possibilities are presented to them, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, they say: He is One (i.e. indivisible) and free of assembly (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) and composition (ta'leef) whilst not being minute and insignificant.  <li> Then ar-Raazee says that this position of theirs is something that sensory perception and the imagination cannot accept, and neither can the intellect. Then he explains his reasoning as follows:  <li> That anything that can be pointed towards, if it extends in any direction and space, then one of its sides would be other than its other side, and this necessitates divisibility, this conclusion being self-evident. And if it does not extend in any direction, neither to the right, left, above or below, then it is like the indivisible particle, which is extremely small and insignificant.   <li> Then ar-Raazee says that the view of (the Karraamiyyah)  that it is not farfetched to hold Allaah is not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, whilst considering Him Mighty (adheem), without limit in extension, then this is bringing together both negation and affirmation (i.e. a contradiction)...  <li> ... And therefore, how can they judge that saying "Allaah is not merged with the creation, nor separate from it in any direction" to be something rejected by [what amount to] self-evident truths in the minds?</ul>    <P>
Just to make it clear, ar-Raazee is attempting to show that it is more absurd and ridiculous to claim:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Allaah is al-Waahid, al-Ahad, as-Samad, being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without this necessitating He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim)</b></blockquote>    <P>
Than it is to claim:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Allaah is not merged with the creation nor outside of it in any of the directions - (reducing to: Allaah is not within the creation nor outside of it)</b></blockquote>    <P>
And you have just seen what his argument is for that! There is a deeper level to this argument of ar-Raazee and it goes back to the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have made to be the core foundation of their religion (having "borrowed" it from the Mu'tazilah).     <P>
This is because to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, the only thing not subject to divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) is what they call the "indivisible particle" (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), and that is the only space-occupying thing that cannot be further divided (according to them). Thus, when it is said that "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>..." which to them necessitates occupation of space, and when it is further said "... <i>and He is not divisible</i>", then this is has to mean (to them, according to their <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> theory) that Allaah is like the indivisible particle, the smallest thing (to them), if it is claimed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> AND not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>.     <P>
But the argument continues (as we shall see in the second quote below) that since it is said that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> which is said to be mighty (i.e. the Throne), and that therefore Allaah is Mighty, then this is a contradiction, for if Allaah is Mighty (instead of being like the indivisible particle that occupies space and which is minute), then this MUST necessitate that He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) - and therefore this is a proof as to why He cannot be above the Throne!    <P>
In short, the smallest space-occupying thing which is not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> is the indivisible particle, and since Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it must mean He is Mighty, (as opposed to being the smallest indivisible particle) and therefore, this means He must be <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> - which is not possible - so the conclusion? He cannot be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And as we have said previously, many of the shrewd Ash'aris know that if they start opening their mouths and go deeper into their arguments for their positions in creed with the average person, the uncorrupted, innate fitrah of such people will reject the outright falsehood of it all.

And then on pages 76-77 another one of ar-Raazee's arguments:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/raazee-asaas-jihah-throne-tarkeeb.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Here ar-Raazee brings another of his arguments as to why Allaah cannot be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. We'll summarise it here:    <P>
<ul><li>Ar-Raazee says that if Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (which he refers to as being in direction and in a space), then He would have to be Mighty, because he says, no intelligent person would say that He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> whilst being like the indivisible particle (i.e. the smallest thing).  <li> He continues to say that all of those who say that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (which to him is being in a direction and in a space) hold that Allaah is Mighty in His Essence (dhaat).  <li> Then ar-Raazee says that if this was the case, then that side of His which is parallel to the right of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then either it is the [same as] the side which is parallel to the left of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or it is other than it. So ar-Raazee presents either of these two situations.  <li> Then he says that the first (that they are the same) is false - the reason is that if this is a saying than can be comprehended, then why can't the saying also be comprehended that the right of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is the same as the left of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, until we can say that <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with all its greatness (in size) is just like the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) - but no intelligent person says that.  <li> And as for the second (that the right side is other than the left side), then ar-Raazee says this is also false because upon this consideration, the Essence of Allaah would be (deemed to have been) composed of constituent (parts).  <li> Then he elaborates further regarding these constituent parts, saying that in their reality (i.e. how they actually are), either they are like each other, or different to each other.   <li> That if they are like each other, this would necessitate Allaah is subject to [the process of] union (al-ijtimaa') and division (al-iftiraaq) - an impossibility.  <li> And if they are unlike each other, then those constituents must eventually be reduced (in their composition) to (the smallest) parts which are not themselves composed - which brings us back to <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle) and this would in turn make it binding that Allaah's Essence is subject to [the process of] union (al-ijtimaa') and division (al-iftiraaq) - an impossibility as well.  <li> So in either of these situations, it is an impossibility.  <li> So from all of the above, ar-Raazee concludes that saying Allaah is in any particular direction (i.e. above the Throne) leads to these impossibilities, and thus speaking with this saying (that Allaah is above the Throne) is itself and impossibility.</ul>    <P>
To put the above in a nutshell, according to ar-Raazee, those who affirm Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is mighty, so Allaah too is Mighty (in His Essence). If that is the case, then that from Allaah's Essence which is parallel to the right side of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> must be different from the left side of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - unless <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> itself is like the smallest indivisible particle which has no spatial extension in any direction. But this is not the case, <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is mighty, and its left is other than its right. Therefore, this must mean that Allaah's Essence is made up of constituent parts - and this is false, therefore it cannot be the case that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. That's essentially ar-Raazee's proof.    <P>
So when you quoted this statement from Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> - O Jahmee Baleed! - then it is from the justice that has been commanded in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, "...<b>let not the enmity and hatred of others allow you to avoid justice</b>..." (5:8) that you provide the context and background to what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying - and this will become crystal clear in what follows inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Quick Recap and Setting the Scene</font>    <P>
Now, its time to make sure we know what is going on - so all of the Salaf affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, this is manifest, (see al-Qurtubi's corroboration of that <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>here</a>, <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>, <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>here</a> and <a href=index7dc8.html?owrwl>here</a>) and those who started rejecting this were the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and the Salaf showed severe rejection against them. The early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> such as <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself and al-Baqillani (d. 403H), also affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence. However, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, from <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) onwards, they started off a process of jahmification of their <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and adopted many of the views of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - chief amongst them, negating Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness).     <P>
  <img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> So here we have ar-Raazee (d. 606H) providing arguments to negate Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, framing his opponents as being the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who say Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> but they also say Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) [<a href=index264c.html?bolnh>see this article</a>] - so ar-Raazee is addressing them -  and also those whom he calls the Hanbalis, ascribing to them that they affirm constituents (ajzaa') and parts (ab'aad) for Allaah.     <P>
And we need to pay attention that in their kalaamist polemic, the likes of ar-Raazee (the Mutakallimoon) make use of words and terms for which <u>they have devised their own specific meanings</u> (as part of their atomist <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology), outside of the meanings in the language of the Qur'aan and that which is known and established in the Arabic language. Then they employ these words (with their newly-devised meanings) to reject what Allaah affirms in the Book and the Sunnah - and we shall expand on this below inshaa'Allah.    <P>
At this point <u>it is still too premature</u> to bring out the sandal of Abdullaah bin Abi Ja'far ar-Raazee, we have to provide more background so that the reader can <u>truly appreciate</u> why the ditch has to be dug (<a href=index51a0.html?zkjoo>for those who dare to make takfeer of the righteous, Allaah-fearing scholars</a>) and why the sandal has to be unleashed ... so please bear with us and have patience, there is a lot more groundwork to do yet.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Digging Further: Understanding the Devised and Invented Terminologies Used By the Innovators As A Tool To Fight And Reject The Truth</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jcb-digger.gif align=right border=0> Now that we have documented the arguments of ar-Raazee that are the subject of the quotation that this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has brought we can continue digging the ditch a little deeper ...    <P>
<b><u>The Use Of General Terms In Order To Negate What Allaah Affirmed For Himself</u></b>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said, in exposition of the way of the followers of the foundational doctrine of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (amongst the Mutakallimoon), in Majmoo ul-Fataawaa (17/352-353):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: [Concerning] The One Who Desired To Negate Something From What Allaah Affirmed For Himself of the Names and the Attributes</b>    <P>
Chapter: And these newly-invented, general, negatory words like the word "al-murakkab (assembled, composed)", and "al-mu'allaf (composed), and "al-munqasim (<a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>)" and their likes, then everyone who desired to negate something from what Allaah has affirmed for Himself of the Names and Attributes began to express his intent by way of them.     <P>
The one who did not know his intent would think that the intent [behind these words] was to [make] tanzeeh [to free, purify] the Lord (of imperfections), [with] that [tanzeeh] that has come in the Qur'aan, which is to affirm His Ahadiyyah and Samadiyyah (signifying His complete unity) - and he, and whoever agreed with him upon that madhhab, had entered into those words what he considered to be negated [from Allaah], and he expressed this [negation] through that  [linguistic] expression, devising [a new] terminological usage for it, yet that [terminological usage] is not from the language of the Arabs with which the Qur'aan was revealed, and nor from the language of any of the nations.    <P>
Then he made [the negation of] that [devised] meaning to be designated by "al-Ahad" and "as-Samad" and "al-Waahid" and other such Names present in the Book and the Sunnah, and he made [the negation] of whatever he negated of the meanings - those which Allaah and His Messenger affirmed - to be from the perfection of Tawheed.    <P>
And the name of "at-Tawheed" is a venerated name which the Messengers came with and which Books were revealed with. So when he makes [the negation of] those meanings that he negated to be from Tawheed, the one who did not know of the opposition of his intent to the intent of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) thinks that he is speaking with the Tawheed that the Messengers came with, and he calls his faction "al-Muwahhideen (the Monotheists)", as is done by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and whoever agreed with them in negating something of the Attributes, and they call that "Tawheed".</blockquote>    <P>
So here Shaykh ul-Islaam has outlined broadly one of the main methods employed by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to negate what Allaah affirmed for Himself. That is, to enter into certain terms and words, meanings that are other than their established meanings in the language and then to use those generalized terms as a route to negate what Allaah has affirmed for Himself (such as being above the Throne).    <P>
<b><u>The Necessity of Separating Meanings of Falsehood From Meanings of Truth In General Ambiguous Terms</u></b>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in "Bayaan Talbees ul-Jahmiyyah", (4/226-227):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-4-226-227.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The fourteenth angle:</b> That it has preceded more than once that this [terminology of] "al-inqisaam" (divisibility), what is mostly intended by it [by the likes of ar-Raazee in their arguments] is the distinction (imtiyaaz) of a part of Him from another, and we explained that this [intent of their's behind this word] <u>is like the distinction [between] the Attributes</u>, and we explained that this is what is obligatory upon everyone to accept regarding every existing thing, and that negating this necessitates the rejection of all existing things, whether necessary (in their existence) or possible (in their existence). And we explained that whatever has been mentioned regarding that of [terminology such as] "al-iftiqaar" (need), "al-ghayr" (other), "al-hayyiz" (space), then these are general, shared, ambiguous words by which truth and falsehood can be intended. So it is obligatory to negate whatever they contain of falsehood besides the truth that is intended by some of the people through these words. And the explanation of that has preceded [in a manner] that does not need repetition, but he (ar-Raazee)  made reference to what has preceded so we too have made reference to it.</blockquote>    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) explains that the particular meaning that the likes of ar-Raazee intend by "al-inqisaam" which is the presence of "distinction" and "otherness" (al-ghayr) within an entity that renders it (according to them) <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) and therefore <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) and by which they attempt to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then this (meaning that they claim and employ to negate Allaah is above the Throne) is just like the "distinction" and "otherness" between the Attributes. And every existing thing is characterized by attributes <u>and as such</u>, there must be a notion of "distinction" and "otherness" affirmed for every existing thing in this regard which allows distinction between attributes - otherwise the existence of everything must be abolished if this cannot be the case.     <P>
So Allaah is described with Hearing, Seeing, Will, Power, Speech, Life, Knowledge - which ar-Raazee and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> affirm - and all of these attributes with respect to each other have "distinction" and "otherness", and rejecting that this is the case, would mean an abolition of these attributes, just as it would mean an abolition of every existing thing, since there is no existing thing except that it has attributes.    <P>
So when a man is described as generous, loving, kind, intelligent - then there is a notion of "distinction" and "otherness" that must be affirmed to enable the affirmation of such meanings and attributes. Likewise, a flower is described as beautiful, fragrant, pleasant, colorful and so on, and these are distinct meanings and attributes. And the same applies to every existing thing - necessary (i.e. Allaah), or possible (i.e. the creation). And if we were to make this notion impossible (i.e. that of "distinction" and "otherness" found within entities) - then we would have to abolish the whole of existence.    <P>
But ar-Raazee and his likes use terms such as "al-inqisaam (divisibility)", "al-ghayr (other)", "al-hayyiz (space)" - including such meanings of "distinction" and "otherness" within them - to make it binding from the saying that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> that He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) and therefore composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - and as such they are able to deny He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with this argument.    <P>
<b><u>More on the False Argument of ar-Raazee Regarding "Multiplicity", "Divisibility"</u></b>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in the Bayaan (3/210-211), regarding the proof of ar-Raazee regarding Allaah's name "al-Waahid" and that this negates "multiplicity", and "divisibility" - and what he means by these terms are what he has devised himself of the meanings that are not known in the Arabic language - and He intends by this to negate that Allaah is above the Throne:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-210-211.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The tenth angle:</b> That this [very same] proof [of ar-Raazee] is what is used by the deniers of the Attributes entirely - those who say that Allaah does not have knowledge (ilm), nor power (qudrah), nor life (hayaat) because multiplicity of attributes prevents the one described with them as being "Ahad (singular, one)" and it negates "al-wahdah (oneness, singularity)", because there are a number of attributes, and "al-wahdah (singularity)" negates multiplicity. For this reason the pure <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> argued by this proof as has been mentioned by <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others. And this arguer (meaning ar-Raazee) he is amongst those who affirm the Attributes in general, and he speaks with the affirmation of the seven attributes of life, knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, speech and will.     <P>
So if this proof is correct, it necessitates the invalidation of his (own) madhhab [of affirming attributes for Allaah], and if it is false, it necessitates the falsehood of its use as evidence. And whatever is his (i.e. ar-Raazee's) answer to the argument of those who deny the Attributes completely [i.e. the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah] using this (proof as evidence), then it is the same answer of his disputants in affirmation of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (Allah's aboveness) and whatever follows on from that.    <P>
In fact, that invalidates his use of this as evidence against [even] the pure <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
This is another quote that makes clear the nature of the objection of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> to the proof of ar-Raazee against what he deems to be "divisibility" (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) and "multiplicity" (ta'addud).    <P>
Those who negated the Attributes completely devised their own meaning of "tarkeeb (composition)" which they considered to be multiplicity of attributes, and this was their argument against those who affirmed the Attributes, and they claimed that those who affirm any attributes have declared Allaah to be composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>). So their argument would be that affirmation of these "distinctions" (meaning attributes) and "othernesses" (meaning attributes) renders Allaah composed, meaning <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>.    <P>
And ar-Raazee uses the same line of argument against the affirmers of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness), with his own devised meanings for the terms such as "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>", "<a href="tags/murakkab.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">murakkab</font></a>", "al-waahid", "al-ahad" and so on.    <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> points out this also means that this particular argument of ar-Raazee is falsified even against the pure <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> - because this line of argument falsifies his own madhhab as demonstrated by his disputants, the deniers of the attributes in their entirety (Philosophers, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, Mu'tazilah).    <P>
Here is another quote from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> clarifying the same, from the "Bayaan" (4/393):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-4-393.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
This translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The sixth angle:</b> That it is said: Speech regarding the meaning of al-qismah (division) and at-tarkeeb (composition) has already passed by and its essence returns back to the distinction (tamayyuz) of a thing from a thing, such as the distinctin (imtiyaaz) of an attribute (sifah) from another attribute, and that this is what is obligatory to acknowledge regarding every existing thing. For it is impossible for any of the existing things to be without this. And if this is the case, then that which necessitates existence, of what they have labelled "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" (divisibility) and "composition" (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>), is not impossible. Thus when the proof obligates speaking with this, then it should be spoken with.</blockquote>    <P>
Here we have the same point as before - that what ar-Raazee claims as the meaning of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" is in fact something which every existing thing is described with, which is the distinction (imtiyaaz) within entities regarding their attributes. There is no existing thing that is without this, meaning there is no existing thing that is not described with attributes - whether that is the creation or the Creator. Thus, there is no proof for ar-Raazee to render this an impossibility - merely because he deceptively labels this to be "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>".     <P>
And ar-Raazee is attempting the same thing here regarding Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Ahl us-Sunnah say He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> exactly as He said, but the people of falsehood then use their logic and rational (not being satisfied with the saying of Allaah), and then they start philosophizing with their Jahmeethink, "<i>If He was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is mighty, then Allaah too must be Mighty, so if that is the case, the left part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is other than the right part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and this necessitates the same for Allaah, and so this means Allaah must be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and divisible</i>..." - so the falsehood originates in their minds because accepting Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> demolishes and falsifies what they have made to be the foundation of their religion - their rational, intellectual proof for the createdness of the universe. This is why they have to go to such lengths to argue against Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Because this would mean Allaah is in direction and in spatial occupation (according to them) and then this would falsify their rational proof against the atheists and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, their proof which is <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a> - and so this proof must be protected at all costs, since the proof offered by the intellect is decisive, definitive, over and above the texts of the Book and the Sunnah.    <P>
From the above quotes (and there are many others), we better understand the context and we also learn that there is an issue with terminology, and so what we will do now is focus on the term "al-inqisaam" and look at Ibn Taymiyyah's treatment of this subject, and also we will look at "al-ahad" and "al-waahid" and the claims of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> such as ar-Raazee regarding the meanings of these names - and this will further expose the treachery of our <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> in slandering <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> for something he is free of.    <P>

We will reproduce what is before the part that the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> (<a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>) has quoted and what is after the part he quoted.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And there is no doubt that ar-Raazee and his likes - who argue with  the likes of this proof - do not explain "al-inqisaam (divisibility)"  with this [meaning] that we have established, that of the separation of one part of [an entity] from another in that each part is in two distinct places, or the possibility of that being able to occur [in that entity]. For no one said that Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) with this consideration.

<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> The <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> should realize that Shaykh ul-Islaam is referring here to the view of those whom ar-Raazee frames as his disputants and they are the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who held Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and those who simply held He is above the universe, whom ar-Raazee refers to as the "Hanbaliyyah" (whereas in fact, they are much more than just the "Hanbaliyyah"). And he (<a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) is saying that it is not binding from any of these views (held by these various factions) that Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) according to this (correct) meaning of "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" (divisibility) in the language. However, as has been pointed out previously, <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> like ar-Raazee devise their own meanings for these terms outside of what is established in the language, and use these terms with these devised meanings, with a view to negate what Allaah affirms for Himself, which in this case is being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if he (ar-Raazee) said: By <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (al-munqasim), I mean that whatever is in this direction of [an entity] is other than what is in that direction, just like we say that the sun is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim), meaning that its right side is other than its left side. And the celestial body (planet) is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> with the meaning that the side of the north pole is other than the side of the south pole - and this is what he (ar-Raazee) intends - so this is from those [affairs] regarding which the people have disputed.</blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> This is in reference to the argument of ar-Raazee that was detailed previously in this article that if Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and since <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is "mighty", then Allaah must also be "Mighty" and since the right part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is other than the left part of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, this necessitates the same for Allaah and this proves therefore, according to the logic of ar-Raazee that Allaah is "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>" (munqasim) and therefore this is impossible, and since it is impossible for Allaah to be <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (according to the meaning intended by ar-Raazee), then Allaah cannot be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
So this is the meaning that ar-Raazee intends by "munqasim" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" - and it is concerning this meaning and understanding of "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" where the dispute lies - because understanding and applying "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" in this manner is not known in the language of the Qur'aan, or the language of the Arabs. What ar-Raazee intends that since Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> would necessitate the notion of "distinction" within Allaah's essence (in his view and rational thinking), then this would mean Allaah is "divisible (munqasim)" with the meaning that he (ar-Raazee) has devised and which is not known in the language of the Arabs.     <P>
Together with this ar-Raazee claims that nothing from the created bodies (ajsaam) can be said to be "waahid" and "ahad", and this is tied to his overall proof. <a href=index725d.html?vvitd>And the refutation of this has already preceded</a>, for Allaah calls a single person "waahid" and "ahad" and "waheed", despite them being "composed" and "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>" with the meaning that ar-Raazee intends. So this falsifies his devised meaning of "waahid" and "ahad" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" - which is actually based upon the notion of <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) - and not upon what is established in the Qur'aan, the Sunnah and the language of the Arabs.    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it is said to him: Your saying, "<i>If He was divisibe (munqasim), He would be composed, assembled (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - and its invalidation has already preceded</i>", and the reply against that which he (ar-Raazee) has labeled as "murakkab (composed, assembled)" has already preceded and it was made clear that there is no proof at all for the impossibility of that. </blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> He is referring here to the claim of ar-Raazee that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates that He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim), and if He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, this means He is assembled, composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>), and that based upon this consideration - that it is impossible for Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, because it is impossible for Him to be composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>), with the meaning that ar-Raazee intends by these words (munqasim, murakkab). So <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying that the particular meaning you have labeled as being "<a href="tags/murakkab.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">murakkab</font></a>" (which is ar-Raazee's own devised meaning), then the response to it has already preceded. When <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says, "...<i>and it was made clear that there is no proof at all for the impossibility of that</i>...", he is referring to what ar-Raazee has labelled as "<a href="tags/murakkab.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">murakkab</font></a>", i.e. of his own devised meaning, which is referring to the notion of "distinction" and "otherness" that everything in existence must have, without which it does not have any existence. What this means is that everything is characterized with attributes,and so within each and every entity in existence, there must be the notion of "distinction" and "otherness" (see next). As for Allaah being <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> <a href=index725d.html?vvitd>then <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has already refuted this</a>, and declared it impossible for Allaah and declared Him free from it - both before and after this particular speech of his.    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Rather, it was made clear that declaring that impossible necessitates the abolition of every existing thing, and had he not referred to what has preceded we would not have referred to it. And what is contained of generality in the word "at-tarkeeb (composition)", and "al-hayyiz (space)" and "al-ghayr" (other)" and "al-iftiqaar" (need) has already preceded, and that the [particular] meaning that they (the likes of ar-Raazee) intend, it is necessary that every existing thing be described with it, regardless of whether it's [existence] is necessary (i.e. Allaah) or possible (i.e. the creation), and that saying that this is impossible necessitates pure sophistry.    <P>
And it was made clear that it is binding upon every one to speak with the likes of this meaning which (he ar-Raazee) has labelled as "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition), until even the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and that this disputant (ar-Raazee) [himself] speaks with the same as this in the multiplicity of attributes, and that he (ar-Raazee) has made this binding upon the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> the likes of that.</blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is referring here to the fact that if you are going to argue that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates that He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim), and therefore composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - upon the particular meanings intended by the likes of ar-Raazee behind these words (which are deviations from the language of the Arabs) - then on that basis, it would mean the abolition of every existing thing, because the issue of distinction (imtiyaaz) and otherness (al-ghayr) within an entity, is something that all things must be described with, as all things are characterized by at least an attribute - so for example, knowledge is other than hearing, which is other than seeing, and so this is a type of "otherness" that exists within a single entity, and claiming this is divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) and therefore <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) is the way the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> would argue against ar-Raazee for his affirmation of multiple attributes for Allaah, since they affirm them as attributes of Allaah's Essence (dhaat). So in every entity there must the possibility of distinction and otherness - deeming this to be impossible means every existing thing is abolished.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>It has already preceded from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, and in numerous parts in the "Bayaan" as well, that since Allaah is as-Samad, it is impossible for Allaah to be "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>" (munqasim) with its proper and established meaning in the language, and that since Allaah has affirmed He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and also affirmed that He is "Ahad" and "Samad" that the claims of ar-Raazee are null and void, for Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without that necessitating the so called "divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>)" concocted in the minds of <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> such as ar-Raazee - <a href=index725d.html?vvitd>see this article for more details</a>.</b></div>    <P>
So we can argue against ar-Raazee and say: You affirm knowledge, hearing, seeing, speech, life, power, will for Allaah - and these are all "other" and "distinct" to each other, they are not synonymous with each other, they are distinct and separate meanings, and since distinction and separation can be made regarding meanings established with Allaah's Self (Dhaat), this proves divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>), and this therefore proves <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>, and this therefore means Allaah is composed, assembled, and as this is impossible, it means that Allaah cannot have the attributes of knowledge, hearing, seeing, speech, life, power, and will.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> So we can apply the argument of ar-Raazee to ar-Raazee. So here "power" is distinct and other than "will" and "will" is distinct and other than "hearing" and so on.  Ar-Raazee is simply trying to use this same argument of "otherness" and "distinction" in the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, claiming this is "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>", and the mere use of this argument necessitates the abolition of every existing thing, because the general import of his argument is merely an extension of the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> against ar-Raazee and his likes. So here, the issue is <u><b>the form of argument</b></u> that ar-Raazee is using. As for whether Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) or <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - <a href=index725d.html?vvitd>then that is denied for Allaah and is impossible for Him</a>.    <P>
This is why <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says that everyone, from those who speak on the attributes (the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, Mu'tazilites, <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> etc.) and the people of the Sunnah, they must all affirm and accept that every single entity in existence, being characterized by attributes, the notion of "distinction" and "otherness" must be affirmed for it, and everyone must accept that, and that this reality is what those people (the likes of ar-Raazee) are attempting to negate by using phrases such as "al-inqisaam", "at-tarkeeb", "al-ghayr", "al-iftiqaar" and so on with their own devised meanings that are a deviation from what is known in the language of the Arabs.    <P>
This is the particular devious route through which they are trying to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and deny His <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>. As for Allaah being "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>" then this is false and no one has said Allaah is "munqasim" with its established and correct meaning in the language.    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the saying of the one who says from amongst them:     <P>
<blockquote>"Whatever is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) or composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) with this consideration (of meaning) then it cannot be "waahid (one)", and nor can it be "ahad (unique, one)", for al-ahad is that which is not divisible"</blockquote>    <P>
is in opposition to what has come in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet, and the language of the Arabs of the naming of a person (al-insaan) as "waahid" (one) such as His saying, "<b>And if she is one (waahidah) then to her belongs one-half</b>" (Nisaa 4:11) and His saying, "<b>Leave me and the one whom I created alone (waheed)</b>" (Muddathir 74:11) and what is like that.</blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> This is in response to the claim of ar-Raazee and his likes that the meaning of "al-Ahad" and "al-Waahid" is <u>that which is not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (munqasim) according to his own devised meaning</u> - and that only Allaah alone can be described with "al-Ahad" and it is not possible for anything in the creation to be labeled with "one" (waahid, ahad) and this is false as has preceded (<a href=index725d.html?vvitd>see here</a>)    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And a precise and comprehensive treatment of this issue is what will cut off the controversy and dispute - <u>for this doubt is from the greatest, if not the greatest of the usool (foundations) of the Mu'attilah (Deniers)</u> of the Attributes of the Lord, rather the Deniers of His Essence ...</blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> The doubt that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is talking about is the one used by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who say affirming anything for Allaah besides Him being the necessarily existent is <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition). And the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> say that to affirm any name or description for Allaah necessitates <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition), and they argue against the affirmers of the Names and Attributes. So they say to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, you have affirmed Names for Allaah and multiplicity of Names, necessitates <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition). And then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> argue against the likes of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah, that you affirm distinct attributes for Allaah and this necessitates that Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>.     <P>
So this particular doubt is the amongst the greatest used by the Mu'attilah as a whole, and they use it to refute each other -  they give the word <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> a meaning and definition - <u>"an entity having attributes or the notion of distinction and otherness within an entity"</u> - that is unknown in the language of the Arabs, they treat this as being "composition" (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>). And ar-Raazee is simply using an extension of this against those who affirm Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying that this meaning you are attempting to pass off under the label of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and by which you want to deny what Allaah said about Himself in the Qur'aan, and what the Messenger (sallallaahu alayihi wasallam) said about Him, and what the Companions said about Him, and what the Salaf as a whole said about Him, and what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> said about Him, and what al-Baqillani said about him, that this is just like what those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> claim against you - and that you (ar-Raazee) have not brought any proof to show that this is impossible, whether that be for Allaah or for any existing thing.    <P>
And ar-Raazee rationalizes and claims that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> must mean He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>). Remember, this claim has originated in the mind of ar-Raazee and his likes, they concocted this understanding and this necessity and then accused those upon the creed of the Salaf of claiming Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, when in reality, this conception exists only in their minds due to the theory of <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> they made to be the foundation of their religion and upon which they devised new meanings for "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and so on.
