<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>

As we explained in a previous article in this series, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are constantly revising their article, every time we expose their deception and lies in order to patch up their pathetic little case of trying to claim that because there is a variation between the manuscripts in the use of eye in the singular and dual, that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> therefore is spurious and cannot be relied upon - when the reality is that this has been proved to be a completely immaterial matter given the fact that later <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> like <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> and al-Aamidee admit that earlier <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> affirm two eyes for Allaah (<a href=indexbaa4.html?xoufz>see here</a>), and the fact that <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> affirms two eyes for Allaah, and likewise <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in his book al-Maqaalaat also affirms it (<a href=indexbaa4.html?xoufz>see here</a>) and likewise in al-Mujiz as cited by Ibn Hazm <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>in this article</a>.    <P>
We also explained how these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> selectively chose between the different published versions in order to highlight a discrepancy between what <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> quoted from the beginning of al-Ibaanah of the mention of eye in the singular and what is found in some of these published versions of the mention of eye in the dual (<a href=index7298.html?czfxq>see details in this article</a>).    <P>
It appears that they are still on the loose in their unchanged diapers and are continuing to peddle the same deception in trying to make a mountain out of the immaterial difference. They've gone and found another published version of al-Ibaanah in which the singular of eye is mentioned in the opening passage that is found in Ibn Asakir's Tabyin.     <P>
Here is what they posted - for the record, its the cover and quotes from a 1348H published version of al-Ibaanah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/covercairoed.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana1cairoed.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>

Then these Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> commented:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is just one example from several of discrepancies and confusion within the unreliable texts of  Kitab <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> available to us today. In the quote of the same passage from Imam <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> found in Imam Ibn Asakir's published Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari it says 'Ayn  [which is singular and in keeping with the divine texts], and in the recent printed edition of Kitab <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> we have scanned above is found 'Aynayn [in dual form] - again, contrary to what is found in the 1929 Cairo Kitab <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> edition of Munir Abduh Agha.</blockquote>    <P>
You see the fake pseudo-scholarship and the outright deception going on here. In the more recent published version of Bashir Uyun (see earlier articles) he actually mentions eye in the singular in the opening passage where the above two quotes appear, and so they did not compare the above version and Ibn Asakirs with Bashir Uyun's to show conformity, since that is another way of presenting what is found amongst the manuscripts and the published version, and here are those quotes from Bashir Uyun's print.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-BU-eyes-a.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And also:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-BU-eyes-b.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Why cannot be said, for argument's sake that there are two published versions that of Bashir Uyun and that mentioned above, which are in agreement with the point of comparison, which is Ibn Asakir's citation, and hence, the issue of "tampering" which is based on a wholly immaterial matter in the first place (the  mention of eye in the singular or dual) becomes totally irrelevant. Hence, games are clearly being played here.    <P>
So what they are doing is selecting only certain published editions to give the view of discrepancy, when there are other published versions that completely agree with what <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> has cited. This is being done to deceive the reader - and this is on top of what has been mentioned previously that it is a totally immaterial difference in any case, since in other parts of the book, in all the various manuscripts we see <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> mentioning eye in both singular and dual, within the same chapter - so as all available manuscripts are agreed with respect to this, it  puts an end to this fraudulent use of discrepancy to cast doubt about al-Ibaanah as a whole.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Reality of these 21st Century <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>They are opponents and disputants to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-muhasibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muhasibi</font></a>,  <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a>, al-Baqallani who are the early Kullabi Ash'aris in the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the sifat khabariyyah. They are in reality upon the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. The book <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> poses a great problem for them. For this reason they are trying their utmost to try and discredit the book, either in its ascription to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, or in the motives for it being written, or in its actual content. </div>    <P>
To this end they are trying to hoodwink their audience into using irrelevant issues to build the charge of tampering, when there is stronger evidence that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have actually tampered with al-Ibaanah and inserted fabrications into it in order to support their denial of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> as has been documented in <a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf >Part 4</a> of this series. Then these fools don't realise they have <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> to contend with, and al-Ash'aris other books such as al-Maqaalaat and al-Mujiz to contend with. It is all one big mess for them and so they work with deception, lies, and conniving in order to pull themselves out of that ditch of Khurasan from whence their true and real ancestry emerged.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The real wider issue which the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> wish to hide and flee from is that there are from the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who affirm these attributes (face, hands, eye or eyes) <b>as attributes of the essence without ta'wil or tafwid</b>. You have to really get this point here, because once this is established, it uncovers their false allegation of tashbih and tajsim against Ahl al-Sunnah, and it reveals that these scholars affirmed these attributes in the manner of the Salaf <u>without</u> tafwid. Their only departure was in making specific negations that the Salaf did not make when affirming these attributes, even if the meanings of those negations are true nevertheless.     <P>
<u>It is this particular issue</u> that these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> wish to hide and obfuscate and make obsure by drawing people into discussing side issues. From this deception is that they will make political use of the Jahmi and Mu'tazili based critique of those affected by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> like Ibn Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzi and Ibn Hazm against some Hanbalis who fell into excess in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) - whilst they deceptively hide the fact these same scholars also had refutations and scathing remarks about the Ash'aris too (because they were coming from a Jahmi, Mu'tazili perspective). But these discussions are promoted in order to confuse others, to act as a smokescreen and to hide the reality that has just been pointed out and to prevent the people from realizing this, because in reality they have no answer to these historical facts and have to admit that the way of the Salaf and the early <a href='tags/kullabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullabi <a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Asharis</font></a></font></a> was <b>ithbaat (affirmation) with denial of any likeness</b> [the Salaf did it generally, "bila kayf", or "without tashbih and tamthil" and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> did it specifically, "not a limb, not a pupil, etc."] and all of them, the Salaf and the early Kullabi Ash'aris <b>refuted the ta'wils</b> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <b>they never spoke with tafwid</b>!    <P>
Plus the very fact that the early Kullabi <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a> made specifici negations (such as "not a limb, not a pupil etc.") <b>proves that they were not upon tafwid</b>, since they were affirming the meaning but denying resemblance in the kaifiyyah and haqiqah which is the same as the way of the Salaf,  the only difference being that whilst these meanings are true, it was not from the methodology of the Salaf to make such specific negations.    <P>
This is <b>the reality</b> these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> wish to hide from the people, because this then exposes the way of the Salaf to their audience, which is what they are terrified of. This is what they are scared of because there is a lot at stake, and the people will realize that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who came later simply preferred the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and the sifat khabariyyah and taking the way of either ta'wil or tafwid which was unknown to the Salaf or the early Kullabi Ash'aris. </div>   <P>
