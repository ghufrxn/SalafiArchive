<div class="articleContent">






<p>We explained in previous articles the claim of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that by believing Allaah to be above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - [just as He stated in explicit unambiguous words in His Book, and as affirmed by the entirety of the Salaf, and the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, and many other factions] - that on account of this Ahl us-Sunnah have declared Allaah to be a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body (jism murakkab) that has distinct parts (ajzaa)  - and this was responded to in a series of articles dealing with much of the deception of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who are <u>fraudulently</u> passing off as followers of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> - when Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> is free and innocent of them (see <a href=reports/the-aqeedah-of-abu-hasan-al-asharee-in-the-latter-part-of-his-life.html>here</a>, <a href=index267b.html?cgolk>here</a> and <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>) and they of him.    <P>
<b>Today, we are going to turn the tables around a little bit and level the same accusations against the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> through the tongues of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> namely that they are <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who declare Allaah to be composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) of distinguishable parts (ajzaa') and one who is subject to need (iftiqaar). </b>    <P>
The objective behind this is to identify the answers of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>  in response to such an allegation.     <P>
Once we have identified the main ingredients of the counter-response of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, we can then proceed to list the benefits arising from such an exercise, and through it we can understand the nature and extent of the hypocrisy and deception which the later (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris are characterized by.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>A Note Concerning The Plain <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Hypocrisy They Dare Not Address With Honesty and Humility</u></b>    <P>
The earlier Ash'aris held Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, separate and distinct from His creation - and at the same time, they negated <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> and confinement by space - in other words, Allaah does exist above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above His creation without that necessitating that He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>).     <P>
<ul><li> <b>Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari</b> (d. 324H): <a href=index267b.html?cgolk>See here</a>  <li> <b>Al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani</b> (d. 403H): See <a href=index374d.html?dvkdy>here</a>, <a href=indexeb29.html?ltofu>here</a> and <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>  <li> <b>Ibn Mahdi at-Tabari</b> (d. 380H): See <a href=indexee1d.html?gcctb>here</a>  <li> <b><a href='tags/abu-al-abbas-al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Abbas <a href="tags/al-qalanisi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Qalanisi</font></a></font></a></b>: See <a href=index4092.html?ihoxo>here</a>  <li> <b><a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a></b> (d. 406H): See <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>here</a>, from the words of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>.  </ul>    <P>
And as such the slander and fraud perpetrated by the later <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>, such as <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) and thereafter, of accusing Ahl us-Sunnah of claiming Allaah to be <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> on account of their belief that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence also extends to the earlier Ash'aris - like for like. There is no escaping from this - <u>except that these cowards are not bold enough to come out and say that</u>.     <P>
Their only response to these hard facts regarding the creed of the early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> of "Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without that necessitating jismiyyah" - after having managed to get back on their feet and escape the hissy-fit that these hard facts put them in - is to claim that the Ash'aris at different times through history had to use different levels of ilm ul-kalaam in order to counter the heretics.     <P>
So the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> said Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a body and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> said Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates He is a body.     <P>
Yes, that great, lofty, noble goal of "refuting the heretics" allows for it to be said, "its white" in one century, and "its black" in another - and so we don't know which ilm ul-kalaam these deluded <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of the 21st Century have made to be the foundation of their religion except that it derives more from the psyche of Mulla Nasruddin than it does from the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who were at least <u>rationally and intellectually</u> more sound and consistent in their disbelief and misguidance, despite their disbelief and misguidance.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>An Explanation of the Deception and Hypocrisy of the <a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
You need to pay careful attention to the following so that you can fully understand the rest of the article:    <P>
Ahl us-Sunnah affirm the Attributes upon the principle of affirming whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself in His Book and whatever His Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) affirmed for Him, and thus, they make no distinction between the affirmation of His Attributes such as hearing, seeing, speech, knowledge and between Him being above the creation, and having ascended above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and being described with mahabbah (love), anger (<a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a>) and pleasure (<a href='tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>), and Attributes of the Essence such as Face, Hand and Eyes and so on.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And this was the creed of the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, save that they made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the likes of pleasure (<a href='tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>) and anger (<a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a>) and returned them back to Allaah's iraadah (will), but they affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a> and Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> - <a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>see here</a>.</div>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> <u>reject this principle [of affirming for Allaah whatever He affirmed for Himself] outright</u>. This is not how they restrict themselves in speaking about Allaah.     <P>
Their principle is <u>the rejection of whatever conflicts with their rational proof for the createdness of the universe</u>, which is demonstrated through "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" (the createdness of bodies) and "hudooth ul-a'raad" (the occurrence of incidental attributes in bodies).     <P>
This rational proof of theirs is through the demonstration that created bodies not being free of attributes (<u><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></u>), incidental attributes (<u><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></u>) and ocurrences (<u>hawaadith</u>), must have a creator. Thus, whatever conflicts with this rational proof is to be rejected. To the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> affirming any name or attribute or quality or description conflicts with it, so they reject everything, Allaah cannot be described with anything - otherwise it would mean, according to their rational proof, that Allaah is also created and has a creator. And to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, everything but the Names conflict with the rational proof (whilst noting that they only affirm the Names on the surface only), and to the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and Early <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> everything but the Names and <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a> (Attributes of the Essence), such as Face, Hands, Eyes, and being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - so everything besides these attributes conflict with the rational proof for demonstrating the createdness of the universe.    <P>
<b>And so each faction only rejects what they deem to be incompatible with their proof. Therefore, the origin and principle for speaking about Allaah returns back to their intellects and the rational proof they made to be the foundation of their religion and not to the Book and the Sunnah, fundamentally. And their arguments with each other (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) are only in relation to a) what can and cannot be rejected from the Names, Attributes, <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, and b) what means and methods should be used to effect that rejection (ta'weel or tafweed).</b>    <P>
Ahl us-Sunnah (those upon the creed of the Salaf) say to the Philosophers: We affirm the Attributes because they are proven textually in the Book and the Sunnah.     <P>
However, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> say to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, you should affirm the Names and (some of the) Attributes because the rational evidence points to them (and not fundamentally because they are affirmed textually).     <P>
This is because to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> in general, <u>the truth of the revelation can only be demonstrated by the intellect</u>, so <u>the starting point</u> in convincing the atheists, has to be <u>the intellect itself</u>. Thus, they have provided intellectual evidences for each of the attributes they affirm - and as for the Qur'aan and the Sunnah, then they take an inferior position, since the knowledge they contain is not qat'ee (definitive) according to them, only the intellectual evidence is qat'ee (definitive).    <P>
In light of this, Ahl us-Sunnah say to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, affirming Names and Attributes for Allaah does not necessitate that He is composed of parts, and likewise affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the creation does not necessitate that He is composed of parts either, since these necessities are false, merely because it is impossible that the acceptance of whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself, and which the Messenger affirmed for Him, and which all the Companions affirmed without any difference therein, and which the Salaf in their entirety affirmed, then it is impossible for that to necessitate that which is disbelief.     <P>
However, the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (including the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'aris) have a different angle. Because what can and cannot be affirmed for Allaah returns back to whatever they deem to conflict with their rational proof for the demonstration of the createdness of the universe, then they will refute the claim of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that affirming attributes necessitates <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition through parts), <u>and then at the same time</u> they will accuse Ahl us-Sunnah of holding Allaah to be <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and composed of parts for affirming that He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
This is because their intellects can accept distinct attributes in an essence without that being considered <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition through parts), but can't accept Allah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without Him being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and composed of parts.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Thus, they will distinguish between different affairs affirmed in the Book on the Sunnah on the basis of what they made to be the foundation of their religion, their intellectual proof, which is built upon their speech concerning "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" (body), "<a href="tags/jawhar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jawhar</font></a>" (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) "<a href="tags/arad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">'arad</font></a>" (incidental attribute), "makaan" (location), "tahayyuz" (occupation of space), "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" (direction) and so on.    <P>
And thus in reality, their speech concerning Allaah is based around "<a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a>" and not the Qur'aan and the Sunnah fundamentally.</b></div>    <P>
Thus the point of reference to them is their intellect and not the Book and the Sunnah.     <P>
And whereas Ahl us-Sunnah say:     <P>
<blockquote>Where we learned that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above His creation <u>is the same source</u> from where we learned that He is Aleem, Samee', Baseer, (Knowing, Hearing, Seeing) with ilm, sam' and basr (knowledge, hearing and sight)</blockquote>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> say:     <P>
<blockquote>Whatever agrees with our intellectual proof of demonstrating the createdness of the universe, we accept it, and whatever conflicts with it, we reject it or explain it away.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is what they mean when they say, "<i>the intellect does not accept it</i>" which really means: "It conflicts with and invalidates our rational proof of <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> ul-ajsaam" and "hudooth al-a'raad fil-ajsaam" (createdness of bodies through the presence of incidental attributes within them)".    <P>
And then, the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, differ with each other as to what the intellect can and cannot accept and what can and cannot be reconciled with their intellectual proof:     <P>
<ul><li>So <u>the Jahmiyyah</u> deny everything and claim Allaah cannot be described with anything at all, as that would invalidate the proof.     <P>
<li><u>The Mu'tazilah</u> say we affirm the Names as mere labels that are all synonymous and which only point back to Allaah's Essence, but that they do not signify any attributes - since that would invalidate the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>".     <P>
<li>And <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u> took a middle path in between and affirmed some attributes as opposed to others, so they affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a> and rejected the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (those actions tied to Allaah's will) because these attributes would invalidate the intellectual proof. And alongside this they affirmed Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and denied that He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) whilst being above the heaven.    <P>
<li>And the <u><a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a></u> were upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, so they affirmed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> in the manner of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, whilst negating that He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and they affirmed some of the attributes and denied others upon the usool of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<li>And then <u>the later Ash'aris</u> simply reverted back to the usool of the Mu'attilah faction of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, as is evidenced from the likes of Abu al-Mu'ali <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H).</ul>    <P>
So from all of this, you can see clearly, that when the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> speak concerning Allaah, His Names, Attributes and Actions, you know where they are coming from and what their motive is behind it all. It is to protect and maintain a creed that is determined by <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> and their proof for demonstrating the existence of a creator. And on account of this, they were forced to reject whatever invalidated their rational proof from the revealed texts.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Methodology In This Article</font>    <P>
In this article we are going to document the "proof through <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition)" of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - that which they use to establish a Maker for the universe from the words of Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751H) and through the words of Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> (d. 895H).    <P>
Once this has been documented we want to detail the charges brought by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> against the affirmers of the Attributes which include the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the response to them.

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> have sought to use as proof for the negation of the Attributes (a doubt) that is close to the previously (mentioned) doubt of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and they said:    <P>
<blockquote>If attributes were present it would necessitate that they are in need (muftaqirah) of the Essence (adh-dhaat) due to the impossibility of attributes being established by themselves. And also because some of them are a condition for the others such as life (al-hayaat) which is a condition for power (al-qudrah), knowledge (al-ilm) and will (al-iraadah). So it is binding that the contigent (mashroot) is in need of the condition (shart), or (that it) comes after it according to reason. And need (al-iftiqaar) negates the necessity [of existence] since that [whose existence is] necessary is absolutely free of need, and this negates being in need (al-iftiqaar) or having requirement (al-haajah). And precedence (of the contingent) over the necessary in existence is impossible.</blockquote>    <P>
Thus, the response is to prohibit the [consequential] necessity claimed by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to arise from our view]. For being in need (al-iftiqaar) upon another entity (al-ghayr) requires that the existence of the thing in need (al-muftaqir) is derived through (the presence of) the other entity (al-ghayr), thus, rendering it newly-arisen  (haadith, something existing after having not existed) - and we do not claim that.</blockquote>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary of the Allegations of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> Against the <a href="tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a></font>    <P>
After reading the above, the following allegations of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> can be extracted, whilst noting that the meaning of the word "quiddity" is the essential quality or "somethingness" of a thing that establishes its existence:    <P>
<ul><li>Affirming attributes for Allaah's Essence necessitates that they are in need (muftaqirah) of Allaah's Essence, and they have their own distinguishable maahiyah (quiddity, true essence), and some of these attributes are dependent (conditional) upon others, such as Allaah's life (hayaat) being a condition for hearing (sam'), seeing (basr) and so on. And thus, when need (iftiqaar) is established, it proves that Allaah is created because anything that has need (the Attribute) must be created, and through extension anything that is composed of something that has need (i.e. the Essence having Attributes), then it is also created.    <P>
<li>Further, every <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> thing (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) is in need of its component parts, and its component parts are "other" than itself, and thus it is in need (muftaqir) of what is besides it, and this is <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) through distinguishable parts in the Essence, and this proves that Allaah is created.    <P>
<li>And every attribute you affirm, then it necessitates multiplicity in the Essence of Allaah, since each of these attributes have their own distinguishable quiddities (true essences), and since these attributes are said to be eternal, then it necessitates that multiple distinguishable parts (ajzaa') and quiddities (true essences) existed along with Allaah - and this is <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) and tajazzee (separability into parts), which is also <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> (divisibility into parts).    <P>
<li>And affirmation of the attributes necessitates that He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), or He is an incidental attribute of a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) - and as for us (the Philosophers) - then Allaah being "knowing" (aalim) is interpreted by us to mean "He is not a body", and His being "hearing" (samee') is interpreted by us to mean, "He is not a body", and His being "seeing" (baseer) is interpreted by us to mean, "He is not a body" and so on, and thus we negate <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> from Allaah, and we negate <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>, ajzaa', tajuzzee, iftiqaar and so on from Him. And if you do not negate the meanings of these terms from him, then you are <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>.</ul>    <P>

Regarding the allegation that the presence of attributes necessitates iftiqaar (need) within the Essence of Allaah, then <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> responds to this (p. 118-119):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sharh-kubraa-rep-118-119-a.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Thus, the response is to prohibit the [consequential] necessity (mulaazamah) [claimed by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to arise from our view]. For being in need (al-iftiqaar) upon another entity (al-ghayr) requires that the existence of the thing in need (al-muftaqir) is derived through (the presence of) the other entity (al-ghayr), thus, rendering it newly-arisen (haadith, something existing after having not existed) - and we do not claim that.    <P>
Rather, we say that His, the Exalted's, Attributes are all necessary in existence, not having need of any requirement, absolutely. And if you mean by (the term) "al-iftiqaar (being in need)", [the meaning of] concomitance (mulaazamah, meaning two things existing in connection with one another), and the absence of separation of one of the two existents from the other, then we would prohibit the exceptionality, and "al-iftiqaar" with this meaning would not negate [the necessity of] existence.    <P>
So why have you (the Philosophers) said that this dependence (tawaqquf) (of the attributes) in knowledge or in existence - which you have labelled as "iftiqaar (being in need)" - negates the necessity of existence, or necessitates (only) its possibility...</blockquote>    <P>
The essence of the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> response is basically that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> are making it binding and necessary that the presence of the Attributes makes them dependent upon and having a need for Allaah's Essence in their existence, and as such they are newly-arisen (haadithah), because their existence depends upon something other than them. So <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> responds to this allegation and says: "<i>We do not claim that</i>." Then he raises the issue of what the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> intend and mean by the term "al-iftiqaar", and says that if you simply mean that two existents are present alongside each other, without one of them separating from the other, then this meaning is not one that makes Allaah something created and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>. And then he rebukes the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> for labelling this correct meaning with "al-iftiqaar (need)".    <P>
Then a little later, on page 119, he says, addressing the Philosophers:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and thus, your humiliation becomes apparent through your claim for whose validation you found no route except the fraud through the word "al-iftiqaar" [and its contained] presumption and its use to (denote) unrestricted and unqualified dependence...    <P>
... So in summary, these people made (mere) imaginations - despite the weakness (in these imaginations) - to be the judge and they made them the evidences therein ...</blockquote>    <P>
Meaning that the fraud of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> lies in their entering meanings into the term "al-iftiqaar" which they used to make the allegation of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>, tajazzee (composition and separability into parts) against the Sifaatiyyah (those factions affirming the Attributes), and then they made these presumptions of meaning to be the judge to which judgment is deferred to.    <P>

Here through this quote of Ibn at-Tilmisani, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> explains that when the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> realized that their proof (of tarkeeb) necessitated distinguishable quiddities (true essences) within the Self of Allaah, which necessitates composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) they were forced to deny the Attributes (and the Names signifying them), and then they explained away the Names, so their explanation of "al-Aleem" (Knowing, with the attribute of knowledge) would be "He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)", and their explanation of "al-Baseer" (Seeing, with the attribute of sight) would be "He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)" and so on. And <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> says to them that this tanzeeh (negating <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> for Allaah) then they are aided in that but requested to affirm these Names (and the corresponding attributes) on account of the intellectual proof of what is found in the creation of precision and perfection - indicating his being "al-Aleem", with "ilm" (knowledge).    <P>
The equation of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> here is:    <P>

And in the last quote <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> also requested the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - that in addition to their tanzeeh, when they say "Allaah is no a (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) body", that they should also affirm the Names and Attributes, on account of the rational proof indicating that. And here, it should be noted what has been pointed out that it is only because the intellect - to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - does not allow the affirmation of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, that they cannot accept it, whereas the intellect does allow the affirmation of Names and (to the Kullaaabiyyah, <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) some of the Attributes, that they affirm them.    <P>
In opposition to them, Ahl us-Sunnah say that <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, Attributes and Actions, and that He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> should all be accepted because the textual Sharee'ah proof affirms them, and there is no distinction between them from that aspect.    <P>

In summary, the response of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to the allegations of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is:    <P>

<li>To distinguish between correct, true meanings from false, devised meanings in terms such as al-iftiqaar (need) and at-tarkeeb (composition) and al-ghayr (other) and so on, and to highlight the fraud of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in terminology    <P>

And it is important to understand that the quotes from as-Sanusi's "Sharh al-Kubraa" when discussing the allegation of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition), <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> is reprimanding <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> for being affected by this same proof of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and he said (page 120):    <P>

And <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> here is in agreement with <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim who preceded him in rebutting this particular argument of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> which is nothing but that same argument of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn al-Qayyim on the Philosophers' and Their Terminologies</font>    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim said, in as-Sawaa'iq (p. 365-367)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sawaaiq-mawsilee-365-367.gif border=0>    <P>
The translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And in this doubt there is such deceipt and fraud, and [the use of] generalized words and ambiguous meanings whose description will become very lengthy. And the soldiers of Islaam, upon the variety of their madhhabs, dedicated (themselves) to destroy it.     <P>
For "al-murakkab (<a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>)" is a general word by which     <P>
<ul><li>That thing which is composed (put together) by something else is intended,   <li>And (also) what was separated and the all its parts came together,   <li>And also that of which a part is possible to be separated from another part. </ul>    <P>
And Allaah, the Sublime, is purified from these compositions. But what is intended in the terminological usage of those (<a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>) is whatever has a specific quiddity ...</blockquote>    <P>
Quiddity here means: The essential quality or "somethingness" of a thing that establishes its existence.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> ...But what is intended in the terminological usage of those (<a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>) [by tarkeeb] is     <P>
<ul><li>Whatever has a specific quiddity  through which it is distinguished from all other quiddities,   <li>And also whatever has an essence and attributes whence some of its attributes are distinguished from others</ul>    <P>
And this is affirmed for Him, the Sublime, even if they (the Philosophers) call it "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>", as has preceded.    <P>
And likewise the word "al-iftiqaar", it is a general word by which the need (faqr) of the quiddity for an originator besides itself to bring about its existence is intended, and Allaah, the Sublime, is purified of this need (iftiqaar).    <P>
And what is also intended by it is a quiddity is in need of its own essence (dhaat) in its essence (dhaat), and there is no foundation (of existence) for its essence except by its own essence, and that an attribute is not established by itself, that it is only established with the one described by it - and this meaning is true, even if those deceivers call it "faqr" (need, want).    <P>
And likewise the word "al-ghayr" (other), there is a generality (of meaning) in it. It can be intende by "ghayrayn" (two things other to each other) the separation of one from the other in terms of essence (dhaat), or place (makaan) or time (zamaan). And the Attributes of [Allaah] al-Qadeem, the Sublime, are not "ghayr" [with respect to each other] through this consideration (of the meaning). And it is [also] intended by "ghayrayn" (two things other to each other), the permissibility of having knowledge of one of them besides the other, and this meaning is true regarding His Essence and His Attributes, the Sublime, even if they call them "aghyaar" (multiple "others"). For the creation knows of the Creator an attribute after an attribute, and the most knowledgeable of the creation about Him said:     <P>
<blockquote>I am not able to enumerate praise upon you as you have praised yourself. [Muslim, Abu Dawud]</blockquote>    <P>
And this is due to the abundance of His Names and attributes of His perfection and qualities of His Majesty. And he said:    <P>
<blockquote>I seek refuge in your pleasure from your anger,and I seek refuge in your pardon from your punishment. [Muslim, Abu Dawud]</blockquote>    <P>
And that in whom refuge is sought, is other than that from which refuge is sought.    <P>
And the intent is that calling this "tarkeeb (composition)" and "iftiqaar (need, want)" and "ghayr (otherness)" is a convention (in meaning) concocted by them, and the importance is not in the words, the importance is in the meanings, and their saying, "He is in need of subordinate parts" is deception, for al-Qadeem (the eternal) described with attributes that are necessary for Him, then it is impossible that His attributes separate from Him, and He has no reality [of existence] except an Essence described with attributes, such that it can be said, "That reality is in need of other than it (for its existence), even if you call that attribute "ghayr" (an "other"), for the Essence and the Attributes are inseparable, one of them is not found except with the other.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is the reply of Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751H) to the allegations of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Taymiyyah on ar-Razi's Use of the Doubts of the <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font>    <P>
And for the record it is befitting that we bring the quotation from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (d. 728H) on account of which 21st century Kalam Atomists have accused Him of claiming Allaah to be composite:    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah said in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>" (3/440):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-440-quote.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it is said to him (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>): Your saying, "<i>If He was divisibe (munqasim), He would be composed, assembled (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - and its invalidation has already preceded</i>", and the reply against that which he (ar-Raazee) has labeled as "murakkab (composed, assembled)" has already preceded and it was made clear that there is no proof at all for the impossibility of that.    <P>
Rather, it was made clear that declaring that impossible necessitates the abolition of every existing thing, and had he not referred to what has preceded we would not have referred to it. And what is contained of generality in the word "at-tarkeeb (composition)", and "al-hayyiz (space)" and "al-ghayr" (other)" and "al-iftiqaar" (need) has already preceded, and that the [particular] meaning that they (the likes of ar-Raazee) intend, it is necessary that every existing thing be described with it, regardless of whether it's [existence] is necessary (i.e. Allaah) or possible (i.e. the creation), and that saying that this is impossible necessitates pure sophistry.    <P>
And it was made clear that it is binding upon every one to speak with the likes of this meaning which (he ar-Raazee) has labelled as "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition), until even the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and that this disputant (ar-Raazee) [himself] speaks with the same as this in the multiplicity of attributes [that he, <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, affirms for Allaah], and that he (ar-Raazee) has made binding upon the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> the likes of that.</blockquote>    <P>
And so this is as plain and as clear as daylight. It is nothing but pure hypocrisy to accept as-Sanusi's refutation of ar-Razi's use of the proof of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>, and not accept Ibn Taymiyyah's and Ibn al-Qayyim's refutation of ar-Razi's use of the proof of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for the issue of <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> considering Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to necessitate location and therefore <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>, and therefore him not agreeing with <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, then that is a different issue to the one we are discussing here - and in that case, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> also differs with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a>, and Ibn Mahdi at-Tabaree and <a href='tags/abu-al-abbas-al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Abbas <a href="tags/al-qalanisi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Qalanisi</font></a></font></a>, the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who are in agreement with <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, let alone all the revealed Books, all the Prophets, all the Companions and the entirety of the Salaf who affirm that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>had the honesty and integrity to acknowledge that</a>.</div>    <P>
However, we are discussing the proof of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> unscrupulously used by <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, and which <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is addressing and refuting in the quotation above, and <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> who came after <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim also refutes <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> in exactly the same way. And all of this exposes the deception and treachery of the <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> Jahmee Baleeds.    <P>
As for the distinction between Allaah's Essence described with attributes and between Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> As'haris speak with that distinction because what can and cannot be said of Allaah returns back to their intellects and not to what Allaah revealed in the Book and the Sunnah, and thus they differentiate between it to allow themselves to give an answer in reply to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, but not accept the same answer from Ahl us-Sunnah who affirm Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
As for Ahl us-Sunnah, since their foundational principle for speaking about Allaah is to limit themselves to whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself or negated from Himself or what He affirmed or negated for Himself through His Messenger, then they do not distinguish between Allaah's Essence being described with Attributes - that this does not necessitate composition - and between Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - that this too, does not necessitate composition. They do not distinguish between them.    <P>
And this highlights that the Tawheed of the people of the Sunnah is whatever Allaah and His Messenger said in accordance with the unanimous agreement of the Salaf, and from it is that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, separate and distinct from the creation - and that the Tawheed of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is "al-jawhar wal-'arad" (substance and incidental attribute) or "al-maadah was-soorah" (matter and form), that Allaah is not <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>, nor a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, nor an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, nor in place, nor in direction, nor occupying space, nor this and nor that and nor this and nor that ...    <P>
