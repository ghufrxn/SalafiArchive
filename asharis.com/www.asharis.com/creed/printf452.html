<font class='titleHeadline'>Bayaan Talbees al-Ash'ariyyah [al-Kullaabiyah al-Jahmiyyah]</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover of one of most famous of Ash'ari textbooks it is al-Bayjoori's <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> (Marginal Commentary) upon "Jawharat ut-Tawheed". Al-Bayjuri is from the 13th century hijri (d. 1276H).    <P>
We already quoted previously from this book what proves that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> hold that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word, is created (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>see here</a>), and they dislike that their true and real saying should be openly propagated. They have acted like this at least from the time of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi who debated with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in his time <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>and exposed what is with them of deception and concealment</a>.    <P>
In this article we want to quote another brief passage from the same book which corroborates and establishes that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> believe just as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> believe that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our possession, which is recited, heard, memorized, written, in letter and word, is created. The only differences between them is that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> do not affirm the attribute of speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) for Allaah and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> affirm <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> but only as something created, just like "the House of Allaah", or "the Mosques of Allaah", or "the She-Camel of Allaah", and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> affirm what was innovated by <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) of the doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" on account of which they claim Allaah is "mutakallim" and described with "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>". Thereafter, the dispute between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> became one of wording only and not an actual dispute in the reality of the affair. While they are all agreed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us is created, they simply disputed about the reality of that thing which if affirmed allows it to be said that Allaah is "mutakallim" (one who speaks) with "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) - and this is readily admitted by themselves in their own books, and its all just a matter of definitions (playing with words!). See these articles here.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Is the Created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Superior to the Prophet (alayhis salaam)?</font>    <P>
To fully grasp what is to follow <a href=index681f.html?xbxok>we suggest you go to this article first</a>, from <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H) and have a good read of his statement, then come back here, so you can understand the reality of the position of the Asha'rites that is found in their textbooks and taught in their schools.    <P>
In al-Bayjoori's <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a>, (p. 161), there occurs, within the context of the discussion of the Qur'an:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjuri-quran-better-or-prophet.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with the meaning of the wording that is recited more excellent? Or is our leader, Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [more excellent]. Some of them have held on to what has been reported [that]: "<i>Every letter is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad</i>". However it's [authenticity] is not verified as established. <b>And the truth is that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent because he is more excellent than every created thing (makhlooq)</b>, as is taken from the speech (i.e. commentary) of al-Jalaal al-Mahallee upon the Burdah. And what supports this is that it (the Qur'an) is the action of the reciter and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent than the reciter and all of his actions. But it is safer to withhold from the likes of this, for the mind being devoid of this does not harm it. End summarized quote from the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of the Shaykh, al-Ameer.</blockquote>    <P>
As you can see, this is as plain as broad daylight, that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our presence, in letter and word, recited by the reciter - which the Salaf held to be uncreated (meaning the words, not the voice of the reciter in conveying those words, but the words conveyed through the voice) - is to them <u>something created</u>. So they made an uncreated attribute of Allaah Most High, <u>His Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>)</u>, of which is the Qur'aan - and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allaah's knowledge (ilm), and there is only one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and it is all the same however it is found, and it is this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word - to be inferior to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), alongside the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is indeed the  most excellent and superior amongst the creation. And whilst their statement that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is superior to every created thing is certainly the truth, they have included within the created things the uncreated attribute of Allaah which is His Speech, which is His <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, which is this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, for there are no two Qur'ans, <u>the Salaf only knew of one Qur'an</u>, and if you doubt that, then go to Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee (d. 258H), the Shaykh of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, <a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>he'll tell you more about it</a>, and go and ask <a href='tags/ibn-jareer-at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jareer <a href="tags/at-tabari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Tabari</font></a></font></a> (d. 310H), <a href=index171b.html?xyfnr>he will tell you more about it</a> as well.    <P>
Compare the above from this major Ash'arite textbook with the saying of al-Imaam al-Bukhaaree in his monumental book "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" (p. 57):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bukhaaree-tilaawah-maqroo-jahmites.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Alongside [the fact] that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'attilah, they dispute with the people of knowledge regarding the speech (qawl) of Allaah, that Allaah does not speak (takallam), and if He speaks, then His speech is created [i.e. the speech He creates amongst the creatures]. So they said:    <P>
<blockquote>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is recited [that comprises] Allaah's knowledge, is created (makhlooq).</blockquote>    <P>
<b>So they did not distinguish between the [act of] recitation (tilaawah) of the servant and between that which is recited (maqroo')</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>This is a clear and explicit indication from the words of Imaam al-Bukhaaree (rahimahullaah) that what is taught by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> through al-Bayuri's explanation of al-Jawharah, is the very doctrine of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, for al-Bayjuri states explicitly that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is "<u>al-lafdh al-maqroo'</u>", meaning the recited word (which is distinguished from the act of recitation of the servant) is created.</b>    <P>
And al-Bayjuri says in another place (p. 162):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth-2.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the outcome (of this discussion) is that every apparent [text] from the Book and the Sunnah that indicates [its] <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> [meaning "created", to them the Mutakallimoon] then it is to be carried to [be in reference] to <u>the wording [lafdh] that is recited (al-lafdh al-maqroo')</u> and not the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsi</font></a> (meaning residing eternally with Allaah's Self]. However it is prohibited for it to be said, "The Qur'aan is created", <u>except in the situation of teaching</u>, as has been said.</blockquote>    <P>
And a couple of pages eary al-Bayjoori's said (p. 160), leaving no room for any doubt:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the madhhab of Ahl us-Sunnah is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, with the meaning of al-Kalaam an-Nafsi [the meaning that resides eternally with the Self of Allaah] is not created. <b>And as for the Qur'aan with the meaning of <u>the lafdh (the wording) that we recite</u>, then it is created</b>. However, it is prohibited that it be said, "The Qur'aan is created" intending by that the wording which we recite - <b>except in the context of teaching</b>. Because it may give the presumption that the Qur'aan, with the meaning of His The Most High's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (i.e. that which resides in the Self) is created. And for this reason, the scholars withheld from speaking with the Qur'aan [being] created.</blockquote>    <P>
Meaning, that in our classrooms when we teach, we can say that the Qur'aan that is recited (and memorized)  in its wording is actually created (makhlooq). And this, as we shall see, is none other than the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> whom the Salaf declared as kaafirs (bil-umoom, in their generality) - as we can see from at-Tabaree <a href=index171b.html?xyfnr>in this article</a>, by way of example only.     <P>
So he has affirmed <u>for the third time</u> that alongside the action of the servant in reciting being created (which is true)  the content of the recitation, the wording being recited and being conveyed through the voices of the servants is created.    <P>
<b>There is no doubt that this is the very kufr for which the Salaf made takfir of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and we've seen it in plain black and white and this is being taught in all the curriculums, schools and institutes of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, and we have been led to believe that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are a long gone and forgotten sect, yet here they are in full force! </b>    <P>
Therefore, this is a clear proof that the contemporaries calling themselves "<a href="tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a>" are <u>Jahmiyyah Lafdhiyyah</u>.  They use very calculated forms of deception in the way they craftily word their position on the issue of Allaah's Speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> so as to conceal the fact that in their books (like al-Bayjuri's Haashiyyah and the Jawharah) is the creed of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> whilst at the same time deceptively trying to give the impression of agreeing with the likes of Imaam Bukhaaree, when they are heavens apart from what Imaam Bukhaaree was upon, of affirming that Allaah spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, in letter, word and voice, and that Jibreel heard it and conveyed it likewise to the Prophet (alayhis salaam), and that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word, is the uncreated speech of Allaah, with speech being both meaning and word (ma'naa, lafdh) and letter and voice (harf, sawt) - and this is what the entirety of the Salaf were upon in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, prior to the innovation of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> al-Qattaan al-Basree (d. 240H) who is the true author of what became known as the "Ash'arite" creed.    <P>
And if they say that it is the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" that is uncreated, then <u>this innovation was not known to the Salaf and nor to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> whose saying was declared to be kufr by the Salaf</u>. This was unheard of until <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) came along, thinking he could refute the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> through their own usool, only to fall prey to them and to concoct and innovate a saying based upon those very same usool.  So let them bring the proof that the dispute between the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> was not regarding this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us in letter and word, but something called "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" - and they have 30 years to produce it (leaving aside the hundreds that have already passed)! And let them bring the proof that the takfir of the Salaf against the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> was because the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (and the Mu'tazilah) were claiming that the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (a doctrine strangely non-existent at that time) is created!    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important Note:</b> Beware of the deception of these <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> parading under the name of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" today when they present their view on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, for their view is no different to the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> who believe that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our presence in letter and word is created, and they try to deceive the people by generalized speech by which they make the people presume they agree with the Salaf, when in reality they are upon the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of speaking with the createdness of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us in letter and word, and we will dedicate a specific article on this in addressing the statement of one of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> of contemporary times inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
Just to give a small sample for now, one of them said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the kalam (speech, discourse, words) of Allah Most High in its ma'na (meaning), alfaz (words), tarkib (syntax) and ta'bir (expression); and His kalam is among His uncreated Attributes. To say 'created' here is an innovation of the Rafidis and Mu`tazila.</blockquote>    <P>
One would think this is the creed of the Salaf, however, these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> permit for it to be said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is "Allaah's Speech" metaphorically and amongst the Ash'arite Scholars are those who give a broader definition of what is "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), in his definition of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", he said that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> can be said to be <u>both the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" [that is uncreated to them] and the "ibaaraat" (expressions), [which are created to them]</u>, and he quotes this as being the saying of other <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - and they permit for it to be said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, the expression of that <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, is also Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech), since it conveys <u>the meaning</u> that is uncreated and as that meaning that is uncreated is conveyed into the hearts (to them understood by the hearts), through what is written, recited, heard, then that can be said to be Allaah's "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", uncreated. As for the wording (lafdh) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> incorporates the saying of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who said that the created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (the wording that is with us) can be said to be Allaah's Speech (just like "the House of Allaah" and "the She-Camel of Allaah") into the standard Kullaabi Ash'arite "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" doctrine, and so we end up with a hybrid doctrine, through which the contemporaries hoodwink the people. And this is from their deception in trying to conceal the reality of their saying. <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>You would do well to read</a> what Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi said about these people and their deception over 800 years ago, <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>and they haven't changed one bit</a>.    <P>
<u>So upon this understanding</u>, a contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Lafdhiyy can come along and say what is quoted above, pretending to be in agreement with the Salaf, while concealing nothing but the kufr of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us - alongside it being written in the Preserved Tablet - and which originated with Allaah in the sense that Allaah  spoke it with letter and word, and Jibreel heard it in letter and word (and not just "understood" it), and then conveyed it to Muhammad (alayhis salaam) in letter and word, that <u>this is something created</u>, originating in its letter and word, <u>not with Allaah</u>, but from the creation, be that in the Preserved Tablet, or Jibreel or Muhammad (alayhis salaam), but concealing  this creed by allowing it all to be referred to as Allaah's Speech, as a veil, upon this particular <u>Mu'tazili-Kullaabi-Ash'ari</u> hybrid definition of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" with some of the Ash'arite Scholars, such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>.     <P>
The reason why they need to resort to this in the 21st century when information is more readily available to people is because the truth through the speech of the Salaf is manifest, well-known and clear, and what is in the books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> is also manifest - so these people are stuck. They can't hide, conceal or abolish their Ash'arite books, so they are forced into presenting (fraudulently) what they claim is their view through such deception and twisting of the realities <u>in order to protect themselves from the scorn of all people</u> who would not hesitate to despise them if they were to be honest and explicate their real beliefs on this subject.    <P>
And inshaa'Allaah we will treat this in a separate article.</div> <P>
