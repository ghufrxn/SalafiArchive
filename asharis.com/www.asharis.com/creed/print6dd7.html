<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Between the Sunni Affirmer and the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari Negator</font>    <P>
When a Sunni Affirmer says,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I believe that Allaah is above His servants, above His creation, ascended above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> as He has textually and manifestly stated in His Book, in the clear Arabic tongue, addressing a people who clearly understood the  meaning of what they were being addressed with:    <P>
So He said, "<b>ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne</b>" and He said, "<b>And He is al-Qaahir, above His servants</b>", and He said, "<b>The Angels and the Rooh (i.e. Jibreel) ascend up to Him</b>" and the abundant verses similar to this. And then we have in the Sunnah, the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) ascending up to his Lord (al-Mi'raaj), the Angels descending from their Lord, and ascending to Him, the saying of the Prophet to the Khawaarij, "<i>Do you not trust me whereas I am the ameen (trusted one) of the one who is above the sky</i>..." and the supplication of ruqya, "... <i>Our Lord, Allaah, who is above the heaven, your name be sanctified</i>..." and so on from the abundant ahaadeeth which reach the level of tawaaatur (large-scale successive transmission). And then what we have from the statements of <u>the Companions</u> and <u>then those after them</u>, which reach hundreds, if not thousands...    <P>
And this is what I speak with and affirm for Allaah the Most High - upon the principle: <ul><li><b>That there is no one more knowledge of Allaah than Himself, and there is no one more eloquent in describing Himself than Himself and that there is no one more eloquent in His creation in describing Him than His Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wasallam)</b> </ul>    <P>
And there are multiples upon multiples of the statements of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) affirming what is in the Book in that Allaah is above the creation, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.    <P>
And also upon the principle <ul><li><b>That I do not affirm for Allaah except what He affirmed for Himself, sticking to the wording of what He affirmed for Himself, be that a Name, Attribute or Action, and I negate for Allaah whatever he negated for Himself, sticking to the (methodology of the) texts in negating for Allaah</b></ul>And everything I affirm for Allaah - then there is - <u>by the textual ruling of the Book</u> - no likeness of it from that which the creation is described with. And this is the trodden path of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan, Alee, the Muhaajiroon, the Ansaar and the generality of the Sahaabah (radiallaahu anhum), and I guide myself by their way.</blockquote>    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari Distorter says (with the tongue of disposition):     <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I believe in the philosophical doctrines based upon the notion of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) spoken of by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and his likes on the basis of which I have truly understood the Tawheed that neither the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was able to eloquently express and nor his companions were able to understand and convey.     <P>
<u>Rather, they consistently used phrases and expressions that in our view tend towards <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and thus your use of that same language in speaking about Allaah tends to the same</u>.     <P>
<b>The real understanding of Tawheed was not acquired and promulgated until our <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> clarified it, being illuminated therein by [our application of] Aristotle's <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> and <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> and the notion of <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle) of the Greeks and Hindus before us.</b>     <P>
Based upon this illumination which we have been blessed with and which you are deprived of, it is clear to me that you have attributed to Allaah a direction, and anything that is in a direction is enclosed in space - and direction and enclosure by space are attributes of bodies, substances (ajsaam, which are made of jawaahir) and everything that is created is but <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) and <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>  (unessential attribute, or accident), and thus you (by saying Allaah is "above") have likened Allaah to be a body like the bodies and thus you have uttered what is kufr (disbelief).     <P>
And no doubt, by way of this illumination of ours, we are better guided than you in the use of phrases and expressions in speaking about our Lord.     <P>
<b>So <u>unless</u> you abandon your expressions</b> (i.e. those of Allaah and His Messenger):    <P>
<ul><li>He is al-Qaahir, above His servants, <li>The One who is above the Heaven, <li>Ar-Rahmaan ascended over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, <li>The Angels ascend to Him ... </ul>    <P>
<b>and <u>adopt</u> only ours</b> [which we have derived from our philosophical illuminations derived from what we borrowed from the notions of the Greek Philosophers]:     <P>
<ul><li>Allaah is not in a direction, <li>Allaah is not in a space, <li>Allaah is not above ...</ul>    <P>
<b>you will not leave the darknesses of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and nor be saved from the misguidance of tashbeeh</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanatory Notes and Points</font>    <P>
<b><u>Point 1: The Logic and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of Aristotle</u></b>    <P>
Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, understood observable reality to be made up of substances (jawaahir, plural of jawhar) and unessential attributes, also called accidents (a'raad, plural of 'arad). So everything created is <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> or <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>. To illustrate what this means, a chair is a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, and it's being brown is merely an incidental attribute that does not affect it's being a chair at all, so being brown (i.e. colour) is an attribute that is non-essential to its being a chair. Accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) can only exist in substances (jawaahir), and accidents are basically changes and modifications that substances go through. To give another example, a headache is an incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) occurring in a man (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>). Accidents cannot exist in and of themselves. Thus a headache can't exist on its own, it needs <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (jawhar, in this case a man) for it to occur. <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> put accidents into nine categories that include amongst others a) quantity, b) quality, c) time, and d) place.    <P>
Some other <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> spoke of the indivisible particle described as "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>", this was also spoken of by the Hindu <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. Though not all the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> agreed upon this, having considerable debate and discussion around it, the basic notion was adopted by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and then after them the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and they incorporated it into their theology.     <P>
When they adopted these classifications of observable reality, they made it the concrete foundation upon what could or could not be said regarding Allaah, the Most High. And thus they used it to deny and negate much of what is in the Book and the Sunnah.    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: The Ash'arite Adoption of the Aristotelian and Greek and Hindu Philosophy Into Their Theology</u></b>    <P>
<ul><li>Al-Baqillani on al-Jawhar and al-'Arad: <a href=indexaa3c.html?haarl>Read about this in this article</a>.</ul>    <P>
Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, who is perhaps the second most important figure in the Ash'ari madhhab, formalized and codified the basic elements of Aristotle's <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (jawhar and 'arad) in his book at-Tamheed. This became the basis for rationally proving the eternal existence of a creator and the  created nature of the universe. Aristotle's notion of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (as a means of understanding observable reality) and also what is called "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) - developed by both Greek and Hindu <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> played a considerable role in influencing the Ash'arite's positions towards other issues of belief in Allaah, such as their view on the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (Attributes), al-qadr (Divine Decree), ta'theer ul-asbaab (inherent qualities created in things that produce effects) and so on.     <P>
<b><u>Point 3: The Origin of the Denial of Allaah Being Above His Creation, Above His Throne</u></b>    <P>
The first to deny Allaah' being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> were al-Ja'd bin Dirham and Jahm ibn Safwaan, and al-Ja'd the true and real originator of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (Jahm took from him) was influenced by the Mushrik Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in the land he came from and he brought this into the Ummah. After the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> popularized this (and other deviations in belief), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, upon the influence of Greek philosophy carried it further. And <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was an Imaam of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and spent forty years upon that before abandoning it - though not being completely free of its influence. And these Ash'arite <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> simply continued upon this, and they likewise adopted and formalized the philosophical concepts of the Greeks and made them integral to their theology. However, the earlier ones (like al-Baqillani) were much better than the later ones (Like <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>, and al-Ghazaali and ar-Raazee) - holding positions in some areas of creed that were good and sound (such as <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and in some of the attributes).    <P>
Most <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, sadly, have to be literally blind not to see this - which couldn't be a more clearer indication of the falsehood they are upon in denying Allaah being above the creation. On what basis do they deny it - yes, Greek philosophical concepts of classifying all created reality to be either <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) or <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (unnessential attribute) and using this as a basis to make judgement upon the Book and the Sunnah and what Allaah can or cannot be described with.    <P>
So what is their chain of narration, or chain of influence for rejecting Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>? Mushrik Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, al-Ja'd bin Dirham, al-Jahm bin Safwaan, Bishr al-Mareesee the master of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (tahreef), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>. <P>
