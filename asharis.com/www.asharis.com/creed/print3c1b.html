<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>You never ceased to be amazed at these people present today who gather quotes as if they are lost $100 bills scattered on the ground, post them on blogs and forums, and then testify against themselves through this action that they don't have two brain-cells between their ears, are a manifestation of pure stupidity, do nothing but blindly-follow, and earn many a great sin for themselves. We previously discussed the antics of an intellectual fraudster on the issue of al-Ash'ari's al-Ibaanah (<a href=series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see the series here</a>), and these people, when they  get sick of flogging one dead horse (having been in turn flogged), they move on to the next, hoping to continue their deception. You have to understand that most of these people are compound ignoramuses who have had their brains fried, and they actually understand or know very little about the inner workings of their own <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (or Maturidi) creeds. The most they have learned is some flashy decorative lingo, but beyond that its a sad type of hollowness in the middle. We are going to illustrate the stupidity of these people, so sit tight ...</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imam Ahmad on Allah and His Attributes</font>    <P>
The same snotty-nosed Jahmee kid we dealt with in a previous incident (<a href=series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see the series here</a>), where GF Haddaad had fed them rotten leftovers and then did a runner when their nappies needed changing - well he is back with another caper. He's posted a series of quotes regarding <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a>,  to misrepresent his creed. So we see the title given as follows:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Imam Ahmad on Allah and His Attributes</b></blockquote>    <P>
And a person would think: Mmm... we are going to see quotes from the famous and well-known close associates of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> like <u>Al-Khallaal</u> and <u>Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee</u> and his sons <u>Abdullaah</u>, <u>Saalih</u>, and through the likes of <u>Abu Daawood al-Sijistaanee</u>, or <u>Ishaq bin Mansur al-Kawsaj</u>, or <u>Abu Bakr al-Marroodhee</u>, <u>Ibraaheem al-Harbee</u> or <u>Uthmaan al-Daarimee</u>, or <u>Abu Zur'ah al-Raazee</u>, or <u>Baqee bin al-Mukhallad</u>, or <u>Abu Bakr al-Athram</u> or <u>Muhammad bin Muslim</u> and others (in attributing speech about <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> and tarkib and the likes) to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> - but what do you get? Quotes through <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> sources through <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who were learning from and influenced by Ash'aris, and who lived 150 years <u>after</u> <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> without any chain of narration to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> himself. Rather all that is in their two books is "Imaam Ahmad used to say...", "And he used to believe..." And then these are the works that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> relied upon! So straight away this is talbees  (deception) because if you are going to ascribe the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and ajsaam and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> to an Imaam amongst the Imaams, you should be doing it through connected chains of narration that go straight back to his associates and companions. Not to narrations which end at kalaam-influenced, <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> (the <u>al-Tamimis</u>, see below) living 150 years after <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with cordiality and good friendship with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of their times, and who never saw Imaam Ahmad's face for a minute of their lives, let alone experience Imaam Ahmad's very severe positions towards the likes of al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee and Husayn al-Karaabeesee who are the Kullaabi forerunners, predecessors of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> themselves(!!) Not everyone who ascribes to Ahmad is upon his actual way, just like not everyone who ascribes to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik and Shaafi'ee is necessarily upon their way.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>An Important Observation(!)</b> Have you seen how these very same bigoted <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> try to discredit the book of <u><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a></u>  "<i><b>al-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah</b></i>" which is essentially a refutation of their <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi creeds [<a href=http://www.aqidah.com/creed/?uwljr>see that subject here</a>]. And yet look at how they cite narrations, like this one and others from the al-Tamimi family, through <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who strayed and took the sayings of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - and which in their souls they have full knowledlge that they are are not attributable to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> at all (through isnaad or through wording) - yet alongside this knowledge, look at how they try to deceive the people. This is a sure sign of hypocrisy (in action) and deliberately intending falsehood. But just wait till you see those cowardly <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of antiquity and their wicked and evil deeds against the Shaykh al-Islaam Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi (d. 481H), which we will address in a separate article, and then you will see that what today's <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Asha'ris do is not surprising at all.</div>    <P>
But then the poster adds a subtitle and gives his game away from the very beginning:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Quotes Attributed to him by the Ulema </blockquote>    <P>
Now pay attention: Quotes "<u>attributed</u>" to him. At least the snotty little Jahmee who wrotes this has been honest and indicated the weakness or outright spuriousness of what he is about to fabricate against Imaam Ahmad's creed through posting dubious narrations. But we think that deep in his soul he knows that the weakness in what he is about to quote and for that reason from the angle of "knowledge-based integrity" he has added this little disclaimer, "<i>Quotes <u>Attributed</u> to him by the Ulema</i>."  Yes, why not be a little honest in your dishonesty? You can still deceive, but just be good about it!    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The First Quote</font>    <P>
So lets take a look at the first quote:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Imam and hadith master (hafiz) Ahmad ibn al-Husayn <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458/1066) relates in his Manaqib al-Imam Ahmad [The memorable actions of Imam Ahmad], through his chain of narrators that:    <P>
Ahmad condemned those who said Allah was a "body," saying, "The names of things are taken from the Shari'a and the Arabic language. The language's possessors have used this word [body] for something that has height, breadth, thickness, construction, form, and composition, while Allah Most High is beyond all of that, and may not be termed a "body" because of being beyond any meaning of embodiedness [emphasis mine]. This has not been conveyed by the Shari'a, and so is refuted"    <P>

And we can address this with the following:    <P>
<b><u>Firstly:</u></b> Note how the Jahmee coward mentions that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> relates "<i>through his chain of narrators that: Ahmad condemned those who ...</i>", so the English reader gets the impression <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> is quoting a chain of narration <u>directly</u> to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. However, in the Arabic we see that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> is quoting with his chain of narration only to <u>Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi</u> (d. 410H) who is the one [allegedly] ascribing to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> what he is ascribing. So who is <a href='tags/abu-fadl-al-tamimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Fadl al-Tamimi</font></a>? Well he is from the well known al-Tamimi <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> (his son is Rizqullah al-Tamimi) who were upon Kullaabi views, they denied the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, fi'liyyah (imagine them being actually being present in the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in the presence of Imaam Ahmad), and they kept close company with the likes of al-Baqillaani and also studied with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> like Abu Muhammad Ibn al-Labaan (d. 446H) (a student of al-Baqillaani), as did al-Qadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (d. 453) who was also influenced by that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. So straight away you can now see the route this is coming from. You would do well to <a href=index037e.html?fsxrr>read our article</a> on those <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who strayed from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and ascribed to him what he is free of.    <P>
<b><u>Secondly:</u></b> Pay attention to the Arabic and look at the mistranslation in the text. Here is our translation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1585;&#1608;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1610;&#1607;&#1602;&#1610; &#1601;&#1610; &#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1602;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1605;&#1575;&#1605; &#1571;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583; &#1576;&#1587;&#1606;&#1583;&#1607; &#1593;&#1606; &#1571;&#1576;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1590;&#1604; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; :"&#1571;&#1606;&#1603;&#1585; &#1571;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1606; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1587;&#1605; &#1608;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1605;&#1571;&#1582;&#1608;&#1584;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;</div>    <P>
Al-Bayhaqi narrates in Manaaqib al-Imaam Ahmad, which his chain of narration to this Abu al-Fadl [al-Tamimi] [d. 410H] that he [Abu al-Fadl] said: Ahmad rejected against the one who spoke with <i><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></i>. And he [Abu al-Fadl] said: Indeed the names are taken from the Sharee'ah and the language...</blockquote>    <P>
Now you can see the mistranslation from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who are trying to put the words of the Kullaabi <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Hanbali, Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi, onto <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. As for the first part, "Ahmad rejected against the one who spoke with <i><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></i>", then there is no rejection against this, as is known to be from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in rejecting innovated words and phrases <u>in both affirmation and negation</u>. But what comes next is from Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi and is the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and it has nothing to do with <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, however the translator was trying to deceive the audience in his translation, trying to make it appear to be the speech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. So lets look at this separately:    <P>
<b><u>Thirdly:</u></b> We see in the speech of Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi the following:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1605;&#1571;&#1582;&#1608;&#1584;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;&#1548; &#1608;&#1571;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577; &#1608;&#1590;&#1593;&#1608;&#1575; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1584;&#1610; &#1591;&#1608;&#1604; &#1608;&#1593;&#1585;&#1590; &#1608;&#1587;&#1605;&#1603; &#1608;&#1578;&#1585;&#1603;&#1610;&#1576; &#1608;&#1589;&#1608;&#1585;&#1577; &#1608;&#1578;&#1571;&#1604;&#1610;&#1601; &#1548; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1582;&#1575;&#1585;&#1580; &#1593;&#1606; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1603;&#1604;&#1607; &#1601;&#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1580;&#1586; &#1571;&#1606; &#1610;&#1587;&#1605;&#1609; &#1580;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1611; &#1604;&#1582;&#1585;&#1608;&#1580;&#1607; &#1593;&#1606; &#1605;&#1593;&#1606;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1587;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1608;&#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1580;&#1610;&#1569; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1601;&#1576;&#1591;&#1604;</div>    <P>
And he [Abu al-Fadl] said: Indeed the names are taken from the Sharee'ah and the language, and the people of the language have use this noun (<a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a>) for whatever has length, breadth and depth, composition, form and formation. And Allaah, the Exalted, is outside of all of that. Hence, it is not permissible for Him to be labelled a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> due to Him being outside of the  meaning of <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (embodiment), and this has not come in the Sharee'ah, hence it is invalid.</blockquote>    <P>
There are a number of comments on this:    <P>
<blockquote><u>First</u>, this is not the definition of <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> in the Sharee'ah nor the arabic language, rather this definition is a hybrid definition of a number of the definitions of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. The word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> only has two meanings, it either refers to the entity itself, or the meaning of thickness, depth, associated with the entity. As for all these other definitions "<i>whatever has length, breadth</i>", "<i>whatever is composed, formed</i>," these are not from its correct definitions in the language.     <P>
<u>Second</u>, the manhaj of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is to reject the application of innovated labels both in affirmation <u>and</u> negation - just go and ask Husayn al-Karaabeesee (the Kullaabi) and he will tell you how severe <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was in this regard. And what Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi is doing here is that he is falling into an innovation that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> would have rejected just as severely, for he [Abu al-Fadl] then goes on to negate the label of <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> from Allaah which too is a reprehensible innovation, since the word "<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>" is an ambiguous word by which both truth and falsehood can be intended. For this reason, the Scholars of the Salaf prohibited both affirmation and negation of innovated terms. Our point here is that it is not from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> to affirm or deny innovated terms, unlike the way of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. And hence, what Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi is doing, is stating the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in rejecting the application of innovated labels, but then falling foul of the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> by making negations of innovated labels in his subsequent innovations. In the debates of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, one of the affairs they tried to argue through was the use of the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> would say, "<i>I don't know what you mean by the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, all I know is what Allaaah says</i>..." and what is similar to this speec, so he would not enter their deception and be fooled by them.</blockquote>    <P>

Note, this is also found in Tabaqat al-Hanabilah (ed. Fiqqi, al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah, Cairo 2/294).     <P>
As we said Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi (d. 410H) is not citing with an isnaad, in this book all he does is to say "Imaam Ahmad used to say..." and then he puts  his own interpretations of what he thinks <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was upon, when the reality is otherwise.  And this statement is not from the statement of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. And the one who posted this  material already knows this, and you can tell this from the language used, "<i>In I'tiqad Imam Ahmad bi Riwaya Tamimi (page 4) the Imam <u>is quoted as saying</u></i>." So those who translate and post this material know inside their souls that they are <u>munaafiqoon (in action)</u> when they reject Ahmad's book <i>al-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah</i> with the claim that it's isnaad to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is weak, and then they are happy to deceive the people by ascribing matters of creed to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> <u>without any isnaad</u> (and a gap of 150 years). Note here they did not translate the full alleged statement, because if they did, doubt would be cast in the audience as to whether <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> actually used that type of language, and that would give the game away. Let's translate it fully, to show what they missed out:    <P>

This is the language of pure <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, or those affected and influenced by them and Imaaam Ahmad is exonerated from this type of innovatory speech. But as we said, you can tell from the language of these academic fraudsters that inside their souls they know this is not really the speech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, but they are trying it on and trying to deceive the audience, because the audience mostly will not know any better. That's why these people <u>really are like scorpions</u> like our Salaf said, evil indeed is their way...    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Abu Bakr <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H) wrote a book <i>Manaaqib al-Imaam Ahmad</i> and he relied upon the work of Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi which contains mischaracterization and misattribution to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. So when you see anyone quoting from <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (from the al-Tamimis, without any isnaad to Ahmad) <u>in order to ascribe to him the language of kalaam</u>, and then leaving what is known from <u>Al-Khallaal</u> and <u>Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee</u> and his sons <u>Abdullaah</u>, <u>Saalih</u>, and through the likes of <u>Ibn Haani</u> and <u>Abu Daawood al-Sijistaanee</u>, or <u>Ishaq bin Mansur al-Kawsaj</u>, or <u>Abu Bakr al-Marroodhee</u>, <u>Ibraaheem al-Harbee</u> or <u>Uthmaan al-Daarimee</u>, or <u>Abu Zur'ah al-Raazee</u>, or <u>Baqee bin al-Mukhallad</u>, or <u>Abu Bakr al-Athram</u> or <u>Muhammad bin Muslim</u> and others, then testify against him with hypocrisy (in action) and a disease in the heart.    <P>
However, in order to <u>sweeten the poison</u>, these people often add certain statements through these other routes (from al-Khallaal, <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, al-Laalikaa'ee), but with quotations whose meanings they twist and which they do not understand themselves.

<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
We see here a number of mistranslations in this text that deceive the reader into thinking that this is a direct citation from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with an isnaad going all the way back to Ahmad when that is false, and also making it appear that the elaboration of Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi in that above quote is the actual speech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and that is also false for the reasons explained. The moral of this story is - as we have stated before - <u>never, never, ever, ever</u>, trust a contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> in citation. And never, ever, ever, trust a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari's reading or interpretations of the statements of our Sunni, Athari scholars. They [the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as "Ash'aris"] are diseased with <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and we don't want that disease being thrown upon the statements of our Scholars. Finally, the creed of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is not taken through anyone except his famous and well-known associates who are plenty and abundant.     <P>
