<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of today are amongst the most intellectually confused, bewildered and ignorant of people when speaking matters of creed, this is a result of not truly grasping the fact that their theology is based upon the language terminology and rational proof that originated with the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers,  <b>the proof of huduth al-ajsaam</b> (origination of bodies through the presence of attributes and actions within them). This was brought into the Ummah by al-Ja'd bin Dirham and then the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. This is why they denied Allaah has speech and that Allaah took Ibraahim as a friend and that Allaah spoke to Moses direct and that Allah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and that Allaah will be seen with the vision of the eyes and so on. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Qadariyyah then took up this proof and championed it, and put the Ummah to trial on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. This proof was taken wholesale from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a> (d. 403H) who laid it down for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> after him. It was also taken up by the Raafidah and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who were led to <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> by way of it.</div>    <P>
<blockquote><p><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">Just like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the theology of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> is founded entirely upon this proof. So they are in agreement upon the foundation and they are all Ahl al-Kalaam, and this was the very kalam (al-ajsaam and al-a'raad) that the Salaf condemned and declared its practitioners as heretics and deviants. These groups simply differed on what they considered the binding necessities (lawaazim) that follow on from this proof. So the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> negated all names, attributes and actions of Allaah. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took this from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> but fearing the scorn of the people outwardly pretended to affirm the names whilst denying them in reality. Then came the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and they tried to refute the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> through <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, but fell prey to their doubts regarding Allaah's chosen actions (af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah, <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'liyyah), so they denied Allaah has actions tied to His will and power (from which is speech, kalaam) but affirmed all of His names and attributes including the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, such as face, hands, eyes. Then came <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> he adopted and supported the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> before tending towards the creed of the Ahl al-Hadeeth towards the end of his life. Both <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>  never considered the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory, but just one of many  ways to prove the universe is originated, and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself considered it an innovation. However, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, opposing <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, took this proof wholesale from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, with a few minor differences, and laid it down as part of his endeavour to support the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> declared this proof obligatory and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> after him considered this to be the only proof and they claimed as if <u>the veracity of Islam itself</u> rests entirely upon this proof, until <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> (d. 478H) declared anyone reaching maturity whilst having the ability to corroborate this proof but died without doing so to be a disbeliever(<a href=index8c76.html?ublmv>see here!</a>) This misguided direction unfortunately laid down the path for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to recede back to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>When the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> began to finally perceive the flaws in this proof and that it can be used to argue for the eternity of the universe just as equally, they tried to conceal this vulnerability by incorporating other proofs, such as the proof of tarkib and the proof of takhsis - both of which ironically come from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves. So a hybridization between <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> took place. And a result of this was that many of these later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> became bewildered and confused and they began to concur with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in their views, and when you get right down to the crux of the matter, after thorough investigation, it becomes clear that the only attributes the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> really affirm are existence (wujood), life (hayat), and knowledge (ilm). The others, like hearing (sam'), seeing (basr), wish (iraadah), power (qudrah) and speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) - are all problematic in relation to the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and so they invented new terms such as "ta'alluqaat" (the connection, association) between these attributes and how they relate to the Creation, in order to answer and remove the problems that arose for them. And for this reason you will see them playing with words, definitions and juggling around trying to make it all fit together, and all of it is mere sophistry and a mirage.</div>    <P>
At the end of all of this you have completely lost, misguided, intellectually bewildered, confused, don't-know-my-knee-from-my elbow type, pseudo-intellectual Ash'aris present today, in their drunken stupor, regurgitate statements in their lectures, blogs and forums, whose  meanings they don't even have a clue about. This is due to their ignorance of what their own creed is founded upon, and likewise an ignorance of the reality of what the Salaf were upon and likewise an ignorance of history and likewise ignorance of the reality of the sayings  of the various factions.    <P>

In this article we will be commenting upon a statement of creed from Muhammad bin Ishaaq Ibn Khuzaymah (d. 311H) who was born in Nisapur in 223H,  and in his youth, he heard knowledge from the great Imaam and Muhaddith, Ishaaq bin Raahuyah (d. 238H) and also took knowledge from many  of the great Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah of the third century hijrah,  including al-Bukhari and Muslim, and both al-Bukhari and Muslim took hadith from Ibn Khuzaymah also. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, out of envy, tried to create rifts between him and some of his students who entered into something of the speech of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>.    <P>

We will first translate this piece and then comment on it in order to remove the confusion by which the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> have been put to trial.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of Allaah the Exalted, and an attribute amongst the attributes of His essence. Nothing from His speech is created, and nor is it ma'ful (manufactured) and nor <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (recent, originated).

And I say: Allah has never ceased to be mutakallim (one who speaks), and speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is an attribute of the essence for Him. And whoever claims that Allaah did not speak except once, and did not speak except what He already spoke with (in that one instance) and then His speech expired, his statement is disbelief in Allaah.    <P>
And that He descends to the lowest heaven and says "<i>Is there any supplicant to whom I respond</i>", so whoever claimed that it is His knowledge and command that descends has gone astray.    <P>
And He will  speak to His servants without how (kayf). And "<b>The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne</b>", not as the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> said that He has encompassed the dominion, and nor that he conquered (istawlaa).     <P>
And indeed Allaah speaks to His servants repeatedly, recurringly, and repeats to them His stories (qisas), His commands,  His prohibitions, and anyone who claims other than that is a straying innovator. </blockquote>    <P>

This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our presence, recited, heard, memorized, consisting of surahs and aayaahs, letters and words is the speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of Allaah. It was upon this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that the battle raged between Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the revealed Books and sent Messengers, and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the followers of the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers in their proof of huduth al-ajsaam,  as a result of which they said Allaah does not speak, and that Allaah's speech is what He creates in other than Him and that  the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created.    <P>
However, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an attribute from Allaah's attributes and what the Salaf meant by this is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the knowledge ('ilm) of Allaah, since all of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allah's knowledge, and thus it is an attribute from the attributes of His essence. In addition to this it is also His speech (qawl, kalaam) which is also  from His attributes, so from this perspective it is also an attribute from His attributes. However, in relation to speech, Allaah has always been one who speaks, as and when He wills, with whatever He wills, so <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is from the sifat dhaatiyyah and also from the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>.    <P>

This is a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah, on a number of levels, but we can summarize here in two points:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>,  Maturidiyyah - they all hold the <u>Arabic Qu'ran</u> to be created (makhluq) and maf'ul (manufactured, made), and <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated), but then they differ in the details: <b><u>a)</u></b> The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say Allah does not have speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is simply speech that He created, and <b><u>b)</u></b> The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said Allaah has <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) but it is what He creates in others and so it is "His speech" just as it is said, "the House of Allaah", "The Messenger of Allaah", "the Spirit of Allaah", "the She-Camel of Allaah" and so on, and <b><u>c)</u></b> The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> agreed perfectly with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created (because they fell prey to their doubts pertaining to Allah's chosen actions, which they referred to as hawaadith), but then they devised an innovated attribute they called <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> (a meaning in the self). So they all agree with each other and the dispute between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is the doctrine of kalam nafsee. The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> made a pretence of affirming "kalam" (speech) for Allaah, whilst trying not to clash with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam which all the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups were united upon. So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, seeing this sophistry, <u>destroyed and pulverized</u> the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> by saying to them (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see here</a> from al-Buti):    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">What you call kalam (a meaning in the self) is nothing but Allaah's knowledge (ilm) [as it relates to whatever is a khabar in the Qur'an] and wish (iraadah) [as it relates to whatever is a request in the Qur'an] and we consider these attributes synonymous with the essence, and since you tried to flee from affirming multiplicity for Allaah by claiming <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (as you see it, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee) is just a singular indivisible meaning in the essence (which in reality is just ilm and iraadah to us, which we consider synonymous with the essence), then why don't you just say that all the seven attributes you affirm are likewise just a single meaning, synonymous with the essence in order to avoid affirming multiplicity in Allaah's essence, because if you have done it for Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech), in the sense you want to avoid affirming multiple instances of speech in Allaah's essence which have different meanings, then do it likewise for multiple attributes that have different meanings, and just say that they are either all synonymous with the essence (and not independent attributes of the essence) or they are all just one attribute and that this attribute is synonymous with Allaah's essence and not additional to the essence. So either you agree completely with us <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the true Muwahhideen and become real men, or you agree completely with those Hashawi Mujassims (meaning Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah) and be real men, but don't stand in the middle as <u>effeminate, emasculated, sissified eunuchs</u>. </font></blockquote>    <P>
This <u>stumped, baffled, bazookered, bewildered and bazongled</u> the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and to this day they have been mute</u> with no answer - until many centuries ago, al-Aaamidee (d. 631H) himself in his book <i>Abkaar al-Afkaar</i> had to admit by saying, "<i>this is beyond me, I can't answer it, maybe the answer can be found with somebody else</i>(!)" However, the point here his that all of them are agreed the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And Ibn Khuzaymah is refuting them all.    <P>
Then the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> would say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is maf'ul (manufactured, made), and they would use as proof the saying of Allaah, "<b>We have made  this (ja'alnaahu) as an Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>...</b>" (43:3), claiming it is a maj'ul, maf'ul (manufactured, made).    <P>
Likewise they would say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (recent, originated) and what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> meant by this is that it is recent in the knowledge of Allaah, because the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> claimed that Allaah only knows things after they occur ,and sine the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a creation of Allaah, it is recent in His knowledge. This is why in Imaam Ahmad's debates with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, they said to him "What do you say about the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>?" and he knew what they meant, so he said to them, "What do you say about Allaah's knowledge (ilm)?", and his intent was that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allaah's knowledge, so if the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, or recent (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>) it means that Allaah's knowledge is created, or recent (meaning not eternal). The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> would use verses in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to argue this (21:2, 26:5) which they misinterpreted. these verses refer to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being recent (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>) in the knowledge of the Prophet and the Believers, not with Allaah.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> As for the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, then one needs to understand their theology before grasping their position. The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> are in fact brethren of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> in 'ilm al-kalaam, in the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies). However, they were led to different conclusions. They reasoned that since attributes can only exist in bodies (ajsaam), then Allaah must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), but they said, "a body unlike all other bodies." They said that Allaah differs from all other bodies in that all other bodies can never be devoid of hawaadith, ever, at all, but as for Allaah, He spent a period of eternity without any hawaadith (events, occurrences), but that subsequently, hawaadith are permissible for Him. So they differed with their brethren in Ahl al-Kalam on this principle of bodies never being free of hawaadith (events). So Allaah, to them, is a body, but unlike all other bodies and He became one who speaks, after not being one who speaks. In other words Allaah can bring about hawaadith (events) within Himself, thus, when He wants to be seeing, then He  acquires this new attribute. So they made it permissible for hawaadith in his essence. Now this is totally different to Allaah have actions tied to His will and power, which the Mu'attilah reject because they consider them to be hawaadith, and they confuse between the saying of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> of the setting in of events in Allaah's essence through acquisition of attributes and between the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power alongside his attributes being eternal. To Ahl al-Sunnah Allaah has always been one who speaks, in eternity, likewise one who always has been hearing, seeing, knowing and so on. So to the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that was free of hawaadith for a period in eternity, and although He had the power to be one who speaks, or hears, sees, speaks and so on, He only acquired them after a period in eternity, and thus when He wished to, He became hearing, seeing, speaking and so on. The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> said therefore that it is permissible for these attributes to be haadith (recent) in the essence of Allaah and they distinguished between what is haadith (recent in Allaah's essence) and <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (what is recent but is created, separate from Allaah). So from here the view of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> is that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) of Allaah is haadith (recent) in Allah's essence, and they also said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is haadith (recent) in Allaah's essence. However, they held that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated speech of Allaah and would refute the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and they are further from the view of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> than the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah. So the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> are not intended by the above statement, since the refutation of them <u>is from another angle altogether</u> in that they permitted the acquisition of attributes in Allaah's essence.</blockquote>    <P>
Then the saying of Ibn Khuzaymah:    <P>

The first two, makhluq (created), <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated) are both clear and they are in refutation of the views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. And likewise those of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Ash'ariyah and Maturidiyyah all of whom treat the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, which is from Allah's speech to be created, originated (see   <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a>, <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>here</a>, <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>here</a> and <a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>here</a>), and they distinguish between it and between what they innovated of the kalam nafsee doctrine, and in this they opposed Ahl al-Sunnah, since Ahl al-Sunnah only know of one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> - see Imam al-Tahawi take care of those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> here <a href=indexea40.html?darul >in this article</a>, and likewise Ibn Qudaamah in <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>this article here</a>.    <P>
But it is the next part that needs elaboration, because is this what the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> pretenders to knowledge don't really grasp, his saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1608; &#1586;&#1593;&#1605; &#1571;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1605;&#1606; &#1589;&#1601;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1604;</span>) "<i>...or claimed that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is an attribute of action (sifat al-fi'l)</i>..." What he is referring to is based upon the saying of the  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and they were followed in this by the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah) that Allah's action is whatever is separate and distinct from His essence, and it is whatever takes place in His creation, and it is said to be an action of His only metaphorically, not that it actually is an action established with His essence. They said "the action of creation is the creation itself", there is no action in between. They said, "al-fi'l huwa al-maf'ul", the act is the very thing resulting from the act. <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Bukhaaree</font></a> refuted these people in his Sahih when he brought proofs to show that there is faa'il (the doer), the fi'l) (the action) and the maf'ul (that which results from the action). So in this saying here where Ibn Khuzaymah is describing a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> saying, he means that they are trying to say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a sifatu fi'l upon this particular understanding, that is, a created entity separate from Allaah's which can be said to belong to Allaah, just like we say "Allaah's Messenger" and "Allaah's House" and "Allaah's she-camel" and so on.  This was how they tried to tackle the problem of Allaah having actions because it clashed with their proof of huduth al-ajsaam. This is essentially what the Mutakallilmeen tried to do with Allaah's actions, to avoid ascribing "change" in His essence, since if actions are established with His essence, it signifies change. Thus when it is said Allah's "act of creation", it is nothing but the creation itself, there is no act established with Allaah that is said to be "creation", so they said "al-khalq [the act of creating] is but the creation itself." However, actions are established with Allaah, and how Allaah performs His actions are not the same as how the creation perform their actions. The issue here is that actions are established with Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
Built upon this foundation, they said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qu'ran</font></a> is "<i>sifat al-fi'l</i>" an attribute of action for Allaah, but they mean here that which is created, separate from Allaah's essence, in the manner just described above, without any action being established with His essence, rather His action is whatever is external to His essence, and is what is in His creation. And through this they actually meant the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, it is an act of Allaah, meaning that which is separate from Allaah as a created entity, something which is maf'ul, maj'ul (manufactured, made). So Ibn Khuzaymah said about such a one, "<i>then he is misguided <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> innovator</i>." This is the same approach that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took towards Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and nuzul and they said "Yes, this is an action of Allaah", but what they really mean by this is that "<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a>" is an act taking place in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, not that it is an actual act established with Allaah's essence. So you get the point, and this is what they said of the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that it is an act of Allaah, meaning something created, separate from Him. And it is for this reason that you see Ibn Khuzaymah mention both these actions of Allaah, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and nuzul a little later, in order to establish that these are <a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a> (chosen actions) and <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, that these are actual actions Allaah performs, without kayf, without being like those of the creation, and his intent is to establish that indeed Allaah  has actions tied to  His will and power and they are His actions in reality.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>There are many fake, pseudo-intellectual <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>, the scholars and students of knowledge amongst them, and likewise the common riff-raff parading around on the blogs, forums and the likes, thinking that these types of expressions from the Salaf are a refutation of what the Salaf, Ahl al-Sunnah affirm that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power (af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah, <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'liyyah), but this is simply from their utter confusion and bewilderment because they've been smoking that Sabean <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad and huduth al-ajsaam which toasted their brains, as a result of which they cannot distinguish between the sayings of the various factions, and as a result of which they earn enormities for themselves, by continuing to slander other Muslims with what they are free and innocent of.</div>    <P>

This is a refutation of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who claim Allaah is subject to hawaadith (events,occurrences) in His essence, and they mean by this the acquisition of attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>). As for Ahl al-Sunnah they say that Allaah has always been one who speaks, one who see, one who hears, one who wishes, one who knows and so on, He never acquired any new attribute, rather He has always possessed His attributes, and <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) is one of those attributes, it is an attributes of His essence, and in addition to this (as Ibn Khuzaymah) explains a little later, Allaah also speaks as and when He wills. This position of Ahl al-Sunnah is different to the saying of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who said Allaah became one who speaks as and when He wills after not being one who speaks as and when He wills, after not having the attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>.

This is a refutation of the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics who claim that Allaah only spoke once in eternity, and that this is the singular, indivisible meaning and that Allaah does not speak according to His will and power and that Allaah will never speak other than that which exists with Him of the eternal singular indvisible kalam which is just a single meaning. This means that He never spoke to Moses with actual speak established with His essence, and that He will not speak to the Believers on the Day of Judgement with actual speech and so on, and all the other instances of speech established with Allaah's essence, they reject them all and claim Allaah is not able to speak and cannot speak with His will and power, and in this they likened him to the mute and dumb from the inanimate things, and in trying to flee from tajsim and tashbih, they fell into a worse form of it.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And in this the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>, who deny Allaah's chosen actions did not distinguish betweem <b>a)</b> Allaah performing <u>an action</u> which He never performed before (such as ordering the Angels to prostrate to Aadam <u>after</u> creating Aadam) and <b>b)</b> Allaah acquiring <u>an attribute</u> He never possessed before. As for the former, then Allaah is the doer of whatever He wills, with actions established with His essence, and this is the view of Ahl al-Sunnah and the Imaams of the Salaf, and this is what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> denied as a result of which the battle raged between them and Ahl al-Sunnah before the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were even known as a faction by 200 or so years. And as for the acquisition of attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) this is the saying of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who permit the occurrence of hawaadith (events) in Allaah's essence, meaning the acquisition of attributes that He never had before.</div>    <P>
Ahl al-Sunnah believe Allah is the doer of whatever He will, He speaks as and when He wills with whatever He wills, He spoke to the Angels before creating Adam, He ordered them to prostrate after creating Adam, He spoke the Torah, the Injil, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, He will speak on the Day of Judgement. However, the Mutakallimin refer to this as hulul al-hawaadith (occurrence of events) in Allaah's essence, which to them means Allaah is a body, upon the language and proof they took from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers who based this proof upon the language, terminology and classification of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad.    <P>
Then Ibn Khuzaymah said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1610;&#1606;&#1586;&#1604; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1606;&#1610;&#1575; &#1601;&#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1607;&#1604; &#1605;&#1606; &#1583;&#1575;&#1593; &#1601;&#1571;&#1580;&#1610;&#1576;&#1607; &#1601;&#1605;&#1606; &#1586;&#1593;&#1605; &#1571;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1607; &#1578;&#1606;&#1586;&#1604; &#1571;&#1608;&#1575;&#1605;&#1585;&#1607; &#1590;&#1604; &#1608;&#1610;&#1603;&#1604;&#1605; &#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1607; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601; <<&#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1605;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1588; &#1575;&#1587;&#1578;&#1608;&#1609;>> &#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1605;&#1575; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1607;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1573;&#1606;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1604;&#1603; &#1575;&#1581;&#1578;&#1608;&#1609; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1575;&#1587;&#1578;&#1608;&#1604;&#1609; </div>And that He descends to the lowest heaven and says "Is there any supplicant to whom I respond", so whoever claimed that it is His knowledge and command that descends has gone astray. And He will speak to His servants without how (kayf). And "<b>The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne</b>", not as the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> said that He has encompassed the dominion, and nor that he conquered (istawlaa). </blockquote>    <P>
At this point Ibn Khuzaymah brings two issues, that of al-nuzul and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> to clarify what has preceded and He intends by this to show that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, and He rebuts the false ta'wils of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who followed them) - and the intent here is that none of this is what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> refer to as either haawaadith (events) or <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated), since Ahl al-Sunnah believe Allah has actions tied to His will and power, and does what He wills and this does not necessitate that He is originated, since He who is uncreated, without beginning and end, then all of what emanates from Him of His actions is also uncreated, unlike created bodies, who are preceded with non-existence, and thus everything from them is also created, their attributes, their actions. So when the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> denied these facts, and denied these actions of Allaah, the Salaf responded to them by saying "<i>We believe in a Lord that does what He wills</i>."    <P>
Finally, he said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1610;&#1582;&#1575;&#1591;&#1576; &#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1607; &#1593;&#1608;&#1583;&#1575; &#1608;&#1576;&#1583;&#1569;&#1575; &#1608;&#1610;&#1593;&#1610;&#1583; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607;&#1605; &#1602;&#1589;&#1589;&#1607; &#1608;&#1571;&#1605;&#1585;&#1607; &#1608;&#1606;&#1607;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1605;&#1606; &#1586;&#1593;&#1605; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1601;&#1607;&#1608; &#1590;&#1575;&#1604; &#1605;&#1576;&#1578;&#1583;&#1593;</div>And indeed Allaah speaks to His servants repeatedly, recurringly, and repeats to them His stories (qasas), His commands, His prohibitions, and anyone who claims other than that is a straying innovator. </blockquote>    <P>
So again, the example of Allaah speaking with whatever He wills, whenever He wills, and the intent of Ibn Khuzaymah is again to establish the doctrine of Ahl al-Sunnah that Allaah has always been one who speaks, and that He also speaks as and when He wills with whatever He wills and that this is from His utmost perfection that He speaks whenever He wills. As for the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics, they made tashbih between Allaah and inanimate objects that are not able to speak at all, and do not speak according to will. And in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Allaah rebuked the idolators when He said "<b>Do they not see that it does not return any speech to them</b>" (20:89), so Allah made this a sign of Ilaahiyyah, the ability to speak with will, and Allaah indeed speaks and returns speech with His will. So those who tried to flee tashbih, they fell into worse tashbih by likening Allaah to the dumb and mute inanimate things - so may Allah fight this reprehensible tashbih and its proponents!    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion and Summary</font>    <P>
The contemporary <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Heretics parrot and quote statements they do not even understand, thinking that these statements are refuting that Allaah has chosen actions, when the reality is something else. Mostly, their brains have been toasted and roasted by that <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> and <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> they made to be the foundational language of their theology, and in all that confusion, they are unable to distinguish between the sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, their own viewpoint, and the viewpoint of Ahl al-Sunnah. Upoin this compound ignorance, they continue to slander Ahl al-Sunnah, the adherents to the way of the Salaf with that which they are innocent and free of.    <P>
