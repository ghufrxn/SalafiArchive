<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
We were requested recently to comment on statement of creed issued by a person named <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> of Birmingham, who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> / Maturidi in creed (the word "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" is an umbrella term that includes the Maturidis, that's how most Maturidis themselves see it). A scan of a statement of creed written by this individual was sent to us on 5th April 2011. <u>We have  no idea when it was written</u>, but we commenced responding to it on 14th April 2011. In the commentary upon this statement, we will come to realize how today's Ash'aris do not really differentiate between the early Kullabi Ash'aris (who were much closer to Ahl al-Sunnah) and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who reverted to many of the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and left the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. At the same time, these contemporaries deceive themselves into thinking that what they are upon is the way of the Salaf, when the reality is that they are not even upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his early students (the Kullaabi Ash'aris), let alone the way of the Salaf. Further, when they present their creed, it is presented in a deceptive manner using generalizations and vagueness, and the avoidance of any specificity and detail so as to allow a false ascription to the Salaf to be made in front of the audience.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The reader is advised to get a good solid grasp on the reality behind the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis and this can be done by studying the following two sets of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
Whilst there are lots of other articles on this site that are also important and beneficial, these two sets of articles will give you the best comprehension of the entire subject matter and give you an good overview of the deen of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and their various offshoots. With this background information, you will better comprehend this series of articles.     <P>
<b><u>Note:</u> It is not our intent to bring extensive quotations and discuss particular issues in detail, because all of the background knowledge and detailed discussions have already been covered in other articles. Equipped with that knowledge, it becomes very easy to identify Tajahhum and its practitioners and see their errors, mistakes and deceptions in their speech and writings. So all we will be doing in these articles is to make pointers.</b>   </div>    <P>
Before we start commenting on his statement, we should clarify that <b>all of those we have addressed previously on this site</b> have been proven to be dishonest, conniving, calculated people, whose lies are plain and manifest to see to anyone with even an ounce of sincerity and the desire for seeking truth.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These are people like Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
So Allaah knows best about <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> how he will behave after the hujjah is established upon him that his orientation in creed (coming from the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi schools) is founded originally upon a matter that the Salaf condemned and vilified, namely the blameworthy <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> which he is trying so desperately to hide. What we find in practice is that as it becomes increasingly clear that the later As'haris had little to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and lost connection with him and that the Maturidis, from the very outset, were closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in creed than they were to the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, <u>these people became more shrewd and more adept</u> in the way they formulate and present their creed to the masses so as to conceal many things (by ommission) and to give the false picture that they are following the Salaf by maintaining policy of speaking in generalizations devoid of tafseelaat (details).     <P>

We are now getting right into the deception now walhamdulillaah, and this is explained with the following points, observations and comments:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> The very first thing that should be noted straight away is that we do not see the word  (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;</span>), "<i>attributes</i>", occur even once in this statement of creed. Instead we see (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1591;&#1604;&#1602;&#1577; </span>) "<i>absolute perfections</i>," and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1575; &#1608;&#1585;&#1583;  &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1575; &#1608;&#1585;&#1583;</span>), "<i>that which has been related upon the manner it has been related</i>." The Ash'aris affirm seven attributes and the Maturidis add al-takween as an eighth (and both groups have other descriptions besides these). However, it is known that the Salaf affirmed every attribute mentioned in the Book and the Sunnah, without any distinction and applied a uniform principle to them all, which is <u>ithbaat (affirmation) without <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> (likeness)</u>, which itself follows on from a more fundamental principle which is that <u>there is no <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in anything which Allaah has described Himself with at all</u>, this is because Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences and because of this we have no way of knowing how attributes subsist with His essence and given that, there is no reason or argument for denying anything from His attributes with the argument that it necessitates tasbheeh, and this is invalid for the reason just mentioned. Hence, we see the Salaf in all their books affirming everything in the Book and the Sunnah pertaining to the attributes without distinction, and in Part 1 we alluded to the books of the Salaf that were authored against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> between 150H to 320H which refute them for rejecting, to varying degreess, the Names, Attributes and Actions of Allaah, with the attributes being attributes of the essence (dhaat) and the actions being actions performed by Allaah's essence, tied to His will and power. The battle between the Salaf and the schools of the condemned <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> was around affirmation of the attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and the actions (af'aal), which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and following them the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) treat as <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events), following the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in that. When one studies all of these books of the Salaf, <b>one will see a uniform, congruent, coherent position coming through</b> against the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> schools and their language in theology. Hence, it is mighty strange that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> is writing about Allaah's <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in the context of al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, and we do not see him use the word "<a href="tags/sifaat.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">sifaat</font></a>" on a single occasion.     <P>
<b>Second:</b> The difference between saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1579;&#1576;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1583;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610;  &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1578;&#1575;&#1576; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>), "<i>affirmation of <u>the attributes</u> related in the Book and the Sunnah</i>", and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1579;&#1576;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1591;&#1604;&#1602;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1583;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610;  &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1578;&#1575;&#1576; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>), "<i>affirmation of the absolute perfections reported in the Book and the Sunnah</i>", is that with the use of the word <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes), <b>you are committed</b> to what the Salaf treated as actual attributes of the essence which include the attributes of face, hands, eyes, pleasure, anger, love, mercy and so on, in addition to life, knowledge, will, power, hearing, seeing and speech. However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the Maturidiyyah and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> consider the affirmation of face, hands and eye as being attributes of the essence alongside rejection of any <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of them (which is the position of the Salaf, <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the very early <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah) as being <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. So when we see the use of the phrase (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1591;&#1604;&#1602;&#1577;</span>), "<i>absolute perfections</i>," then this leaves open the door to rejecting   for Allaah those attributes (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) which the blameworthy <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> consider to be an 'ayb and naqs (fault and decifiency) for Him and as <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, such as the attributes of face and hands and anger and pleasure and so on, and it leaves open the door to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tahreef of these attributes to other matters which are then considered as the "absolute perfections" they claim to affirm for Allaah. And in this manner the attributes are divested from Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted. Thus, <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a>, is not pleasure, but it is His "intent to reward" which is now from the many "absolute perfections" of Allaah, and not that pleasure is an actual attribute of Allaah. Likewise Allaah's hands are not attributes of His essence in a manner that befit Him, but a symbolism to represent His power and favour, which are from his "absolute perfections". So you see where we are going here with this type of word play, and this is the type of talbees (deception) that is the hallmark of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and all of their offshoots. You should remember in history, these were the people who used to say, "I believe the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah", and then remain silent without clarification, and you can analogize with this for other matters. They always employ ambiguity, generalization, vagueness and flee from specificity, clarity, detail, and this method allows them to deceive the people into thinking that they are following the way of the Salaf, when in reality, they are trying to conceal the reality of their saying, all of which emanates and branches off from the saying of al-Jahm bin Safwaan and al-Ja'd bin Dirham who entered <b>the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</b> into the Ummah and it became the foundation of the deen of the Mutakallimeen, both the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> amongst them (the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the Raafidi Hishaamiyyah) and the Mu'attilah amongst them (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maaturidiyyah).    <P>
<b>Third:</b> We do not even need to resort to those 70-80 books from the Salaf to convict <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> for his attempted fraud in trying to pass off his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creed as the creed of the Salaf, when we can simply go a bit closer to home to <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> in the form of the writings of <b><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></b> (see al-Asha'ri's Maqaalaat) and <b>al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee</b> (see his book, Fahm al-Qur'aan), and <b><a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></b> (see al-Maqaalaat, al-Ibaanah, and Risaalah Ilaa Ahl al-Thaghar) and <b>al-Baaqillaanee</b> (see at-Tamheed) and even <b>al-Bayhaqee</b> (see al-Asmaa was-Sifaat) wherein they affirm the attributes of face, hands, eye(s) as attributes of Allaah's essence and reject and vilify the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, which were unfortunately taken up by the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who came afterwards, and which were taken directly from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by the Maturidiyyah from the very outset. We have documented all of these matters in detail on this site elsewhere and <a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>the reader can refer to this page</a> for some of those articles, our intent here is to be brief, concise and to make pointers, instead of going into depth and lengthy quotations which are not really necessary as Asrar Rashid's reality and his games are very plain to see walhamdulillaah.    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> We see therefore a stark difference between how <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is deceptively trying to present a vague, generalized creed with a view to trying to hoodwink the audience into thinking he is agreeing with the Salaf, a follower of them, when <u>in reality he is a disputant to them</u> (as he will reveal himself as we go towards the end of his written statement). We see uniformly in all the books of the Salaf, and likewise in the books of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (excerpts of which have been preserved in other works), al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee, and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, that they affirm specific attributes in a specific manner [whilst rejecting <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of them which in their time was the hallmark of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah], and that they affirm Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and have strong and powerful refutations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in that regard. So if <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> was a follower of the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, let alone a follower of the Salaf, then he would not have failed to make mention of the specific attributes he affirms for Allaah which all of the Salaf and <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their very early followers were united and agreed upon, <i>and they are more than just the seven, or eight of the Ash'aris and Maturidis</i>. <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>, therefore, just like most prominent Ash'aris and Maturidis today, are characterized with cowardice, they are scared to display manhood in front of their audience and speak a word of truth by expressing the clear unequivocal specific statements of the affirmations of the Salaf and the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> with respect to the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a> khabariyyah. Instead, they write a single measly page which when reduced to its core, with all the beautification and adornment stripped away, contains nothing except treating affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> as being <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and affirming Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, above His creation as being shirk! And then they have the audacity to claim they are following the way of the Salaf!  </blockquote> <P>
