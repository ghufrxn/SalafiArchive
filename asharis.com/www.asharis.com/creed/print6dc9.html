<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
We were requested recently to comment on statement of creed issued by a person named <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> of Birmingham, who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> / Maturidi in creed (the word "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" is an umbrella term that includes the Maturidis, that's how most Maturidis themselves see it). A scan of a statement of creed written by this individual was sent to us on 5th April 2011. <u>We have  no idea when it was written</u>, but we commenced responding to it on 14th April 2011. In the commentary upon this statement, we will come to realize how today's Ash'aris do not really differentiate between the early Kullabi Ash'aris (who were much closer to Ahl al-Sunnah) and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who reverted to many of the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and left the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. At the same time, these contemporaries deceive themselves into thinking that what they are upon is the way of the Salaf, when the reality is that they are not even upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his early students (the Kullaabi Ash'aris), let alone the way of the Salaf. Further, when they present their creed, it is presented in a deceptive manner using generalizations and vagueness, and the avoidance of any specificity and detail so as to allow a false ascription to the Salaf to be made in front of the audience.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The reader is advised to get a good solid grasp on the reality behind the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis and this can be done by studying the following two sets of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
Whilst there are lots of other articles on this site that are also important and beneficial, these two sets of articles will give you the best comprehension of the entire subject matter and give you an good overview of the deen of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and their various offshoots. With this background information, you will better comprehend this series of articles.     <P>
<b><u>Note:</u> It is not our intent to bring extensive quotations and discuss particular issues in detail, because all of the background knowledge and detailed discussions have already been covered in other articles. Equipped with that knowledge, it becomes very easy to identify Tajahhum and its practitioners and see their errors, mistakes and deceptions in their speech and writings. So all we will be doing in these articles is to make pointers.</b>   </div>    <P>
Before we start commenting on his statement, we should clarify that <b>all of those we have addressed previously on this site</b> have been proven to be dishonest, conniving, calculated people, whose lies are plain and manifest to see to anyone with even an ounce of sincerity and the desire for seeking truth.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These are people like Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
So Allaah knows best about <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> how he will behave after the hujjah is established upon him that his orientation in creed (coming from the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi schools) is founded originally upon a matter that the Salaf condemned and vilified, namely the blameworthy <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> which he is trying so desperately to hide. What we find in practice is that as it becomes increasingly clear that the later As'haris had little to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and lost connection with him and that the Maturidis, from the very outset, were closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in creed than they were to the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, <u>these people became more shrewd and more adept</u> in the way they formulate and present their creed to the masses so as to conceal many things (by ommission) and to give the false picture that they are following the Salaf by maintaining policy of speaking in generalizations devoid of tafseelaat (details).     <P>

This is a very interesting paragraph and indicates the conniving of people like <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>, this will become clear by the following observations, notes and comments - (and one should keep in mind here, the observations already made in <a href=indexd293.html?ajona>Part 1</a> and <a href=index8379.html?rwbhe>Part 2</a>) -:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> The first thing that should be noted here is that the real thing <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is saying by this paragraph and the way it is worded is that their way (that of the Ash'aris and Maturidis pretending to follow the way of the Salaf) is to affirm whatever has been mentioned in the revealed texts of the attributes [besides the ones they establish through pure reason independently of the text as part of their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology], but to then cleanse them and sanctify them through their washing machine of tanzeeh (which is to negate Aristotles ten categories, <i>al-jawhar wal-'arad, al-maqoolaat al-ashar</i>, from Allaah, the Exalted), which essentially means to wash away the actual attributes so no attributes are left (besides the ones compatible with their proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> which is founded upon the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> derived from the conceptual tools and language of the Hellenized nations). <b>The tanzeeh of the Salaf is not the tanzeeh of Ahl al-Kalaam</b>.  Asrar  Rasheed like most deluded <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> / Maturidis today will probably not even know what we are talking about here, and protest heavily and deny what we have just said. When this is the level of their knowledge of historical realities [i.e. of the roots of the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology which is the foundation of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah], what trust can subsequently be put into their claims about the aqeedah of the Muslims at large?!!    <P>
And when the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> negate <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, <b>their negation is not what the Salaf meant by negation of these matters</b>. The Salaf make <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of whatever has been related as <u>actual <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah</u> (attributes of the essence) for Allaah, and then upon the foundation that Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, the principle of there being no likeness naturally follows, since the reality of the attributes of a thing can only be grasped if the reality of the essence itself is known, and since that is impossible with respect to Allaah, then two things follow: <b><u>a)</u></b> the impossibility of us ever knowing the reality of the attributes and <b><u>b)</u></b> the impossibility of there being likeness between the attributes of Allaah and the attributes of the creation. Hence, there is no caution in affirming whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself as attributes of His essence, and there is no presumption of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> at all. This is in reality, <u>the very foundation of the view of the Salaf</u>, and hence the creed of the Salaf is to affirm all the attributes of Allaah related in the Book and the Sunnah, upon their foundational meanings and to deny that there is any likeness in their realities and this is <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> without <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and without a type of tanzeeh that removes the attribute as being an actual attribute of Allaah in its own right. Their way is <i>ithbaaat bilaa <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and tanzeeh bilaa ta'teel</i> (affirmation without likeness and sanctification without divestment).    <P>
But <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a>, as we pointed out in earlier parts in this series, is simply a descendant of those <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of old who use <i>ambiguous, vague, generalized statements</i> in order to deceive the people and conceal what they really believe, thinking that Allaah, the Exalted, is unaware of the conniving of their hearts and that they will not be exposed and their innermost secrets will not be brought out for all to see, despite the great lengths they go to in order to conceal the poison of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which their positions are based upon in reality.     <P>
<b>Upon their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology <u>they operate upon an entirely different principle</u>, which is to make the presumption of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> for whatever Allaah has affirmed for Himself and likewise what His Messenger has affirmed for Him, in the sense that anything that is other than the attributes of the essence they affirm through pure reason, independently of revelation (as part of their intellectual proof for the origination of the universe) is automatically considered to give <u>the presumption of tasbheeh</u>, and hence, the need, in fact the obligation, as they see it, of sanctifying Allaah.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>It is here that their <u>washing machine of tanzeeh</u> comes in, and this washing machine employs two mechanisms, either <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, or tafweed. Whilst <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> does a fairly good job, many of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> weren't impressed by it, it does not remove the stains (as they see it), as in you are still left with meanings, meanings are still in the bag, there are still meanings associated with the text, but as for tafweed, it is heavy duty, and leaves no traces whatsoever. Tafweed wipes out all meaning completely, and all you are left with is pure, clean text, devoid of any meaning or sense. The strange thing is though, they (the Ahl al-Kalaam) have, to this day, <u>never given a solid, uniform criterion which they employ to distinguish between what should be subjected to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, tafweed and what should not</u>. Even Sanussi did not have any answers. This is why we see all of these groups of Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> with their own particular brand of washing machine which employs a different criterion as to what should be cleaned and sanctified and what should not. This is the greatest of evidence that the conceptual tools they employ and depend upon for their creed (taken from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans) does not lead to the truth, but only falsehood, and those who are upon it and use it are in factions, disputing with each other, and each one claiming it has the truth.</div>    <P>
<b>Second:</b> The <u>driving force</u>, <u>spring</u> and <u>fountain</u> behind the creed of all of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, both <u>the Mu'attilah</u> amongst them (those who negate something from <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions) and <u>the Mujassimah</u> amongst them (those who operate upon the premise of Allaah being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> [body]) is the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> which <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> and al-Ja'd bin Dirham entered into the Ummah after taking it from the Hellenized <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians. <b>And thus their approach to the attributes is from an entirely different perspective and angle to that of the revealed Books, the followers of the Prophets and Messengers and the adherents to the way of the Salaf</b>. Therefore, we will see many of these people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> making statements in their creed which on the surface are crafted to appear identical to the statements and positions of the Salaf, but what they really mean by them is something entirely different because they are coming with an entirely different paradigm, with a particular conceptual baggage. It is this <b>conceptual baggage</b> that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> thought he could hide by this cleverly crafted one page statement of his, as vague and obscure as it is. Thus, when he says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1579;&#1576;&#1575;&#1578; &#1605;&#1575; &#1608;&#1585;&#1583;  &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1575; &#1608;&#1585;&#1583; &#1605;&#1593; &#1575;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1606;&#1586;&#1610;&#1607;</span>), "<i>affirmation of what has been related upon what has been related, alongside freeing [Allaah of faults, deficiencies, resemblance etc.]</i>," it's true and real intent is explained by the last sentence in this paragraph when he says, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1607;&#1608; &#1587;&#1576;&#1581;&#1575;&#1606;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606;&#1586;&#1607; &#1593;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1581; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1583;&#1608;&#1575;&#1578;</span>), "<i>For He, the Sublime, is free of [having] limbs and instruments</i>" (see next point). Whilst Allaah is indeed free and exonerated from the gross <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> of the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> (who affirm limbs and parts for Allaah), the intent of <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> goes beyond this into a type of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> that was refuted by the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> themselves, let alone the entirety of the Salaf against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. <i>He intends the negation of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah</i> (those attributes which are only known through revealed text), this is his real intent. If he was following the way of the Salaf as he claims, then he would have followed exactly in their footsteps and made <u>specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation)</u> which is the methodology that is so plain and evident in all of their books written in the second and third centuries. This is sufficient to prove that <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is just another dishonest individual, the likes of whom <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee and Abu al-Abbaas al-Qalaanisee (all forerunners of the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> creed), and likewise <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and al-Baqillaani (and even al-Bayhaqi) were refuting on the matter of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> dhaatiyyah in the third and fourth century after hijrah. We have established extensively in many other articles on this site that all of these Scholars, let alone the entirety of the Salaf, affirmed the attributes of face, hands and eye(s) as attributes of the essence without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tahreef, and they refuted the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this regard who were accusing them of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. However, the only difference between them (i.e. those early Ash'aris) and the Salaf is that they entered into a methodological departure by making specific negations that the Salaf never entered into. But that is a side-point to the fact that there is agreement between the Salaf and the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding the affirmation of these <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah. This puts <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> on the other side of the fence with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> despite his spurious claim of following the Salaf.    <P>
<b>Third:</b> There are two matters to point out in Asrar's statement above, his use of negation of "<i><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></i>" and his negation of "<i>limbs and instruments</i>" from Allaah, the Exalted. We will deal with each of these separately:    <P>
<u>As for the label of "<a href="tags/tajseem.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tajseem</font></a>"</u>, then it is not known from the Salaf that they used this language and terminology regarding Allaah, the Exalted, because the use of the conceptual tools of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, which is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> condemned by the Salaf) was not a source, nor a foundation for their speech in matters of creed. Rather, this was the very <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> they condemned and declared its practitioner a heretic, astray, leading others astray, and this is well known and famous from Imaam Abu Haneefah, Imaamm Abu Yusuf, Imaam Malik, especially <a href='tags/imaam-ash-shaafiee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee</font></a> and likewise <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and the rest of the Salaf.     <P>
However, those who adopted it, the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, divided into two camps. <u>The first</u> are <b>the Mu'attilah</b> (the negators), and they negated, to varying degrees, <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions from Allaah because the affirmation of these matters clashed with the intellectual proof they devised using those conceptual tools in order to demonstrate Allaah's existence, and which they subsequently made to be something upon which the veracity of Islaam itself depends. So they used this language, "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, nor an 'arad</i>...." and this is what <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> means when he includes the negation of "<a href="tags/tajseem.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tajseem</font></a>" in his list above, and thus, his language is not Sunni, Salafi, Athari <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) with negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> (likeness), rather it is Jahmee, Mu'tazilee nafee (negation) founded upon the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, which is the very <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> condemned by <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik ash-Shaafi'ee, Ahmad and generality of the Salaf, and which he is trying his utmost to conceal. <u>The second</u> camp of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, they are <b>the Mujassimah</b>, who are the Raafidi <a href='tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. Now, whilst this camp also agreed with that intellectual proof called <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> al-ajsaam, they had a slightly different rendering of it whilst adhering to its core premises, and they concluded first that Allah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body). As for the Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, they fell into the grossest of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, and treated Allaah as being in human form, in flesh, with limbs, organs and so on. And as for the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, their saying Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, was merely to afford the meaning that He is <i>al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi</i> (established by Himself), and <i>mawjood</i> (exists), and on account of which attributes can be said of Him, and this is the saying of their main leaders, however, they added a type of <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> in their language of describing Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> as a result of which they were refuted by the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, who affirmed Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and rejected the <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. The point here is that the affirmation and negation of <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> <u>is purely a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> thing</u> and it is not from the language of the Salaf, because they never delved into this <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> to begin with, this baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, such that they should speak in this manner. It is a debate between the two camps of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, the Mu'attilah and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Salaf are innocent and free of any of that type of falsehood. Hence, you do not see, this type of language prominent in their speech. There were some later <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> (the al-Timimis) who were studying with the As'harites who ascribed this language to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in meaning, but <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is free of that, and none of that is authentically established from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> at all.    <P>
<u>As for the negation of limbs and instruments</u>. This phraseology is not found in the speech of the Salaf, however, it is found in the creed of al-Tahawi, and whilst it is not from the way of the Salaf to make specific negation as a methodological principle, those intended by al-Tahawi are the Raafidi Mutakallimeen, the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, who rendered Allaah as a human (in the form of some of their leaders), in flesh and blood, thereby giving Him parts, organs and limbs, likening Him to the creation, free and innocent is Allaah of what they claim, and they are from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, the cousins of the Mu'attilah. But as for the affirmation of the attributes of face, hands, eye(s) [from the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah which come in the revealed texts], then there is none from the Salaf, and nor <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and nor al-Muhaasibee, and nor al-Qalaanisee and nor <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, al-Baaqillaanee (and not even al-Bayhaqee) who denied and rejected these as attributes of the essence in principle. But this is the intent of <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>, to treat the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah as <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and in this he is in reality jingoing with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> whilst making a pretence of subscribing to the Salaf, and he thought he could conceal and clothe himself with vague,  generalized statements and make it look as if he is wearing the attire of the Salaf, when in reality he is wearing no attire and his deception is plain to see for anyone with baseerah. For if he was truly a follower of the Salaf, he would have followed their particular methodology in laying down his creed, and their methodology is known in their books, it is detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> with generalized negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>. <b>Pick up the books of the Salaf written in the second and third centuries on the topic of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> of Allaah, the Exalted and what do you see?</b> Then compare that with the deception <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> thought he could pull off with this one page of generalizations and obscurities. However, as we said, it is not possible for any innovator to conceal his misguidance and thus, it was inevitable that at least something of his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology be made manifest in his writing, as short and general as it is.    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> To expand further on the bolded sentence in the last paragraph, when one looks at the second and third centuries after hijrah, we see that this was when <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> appeared in theological matters and it was carried by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> in the second century (100H-200H) and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> in the third century (200H-300H), before the Ash'aris and Maturidis appeared in the fourth century.  Now, though there was gross <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> present with the Raafidi Mutakallimeen, and likewise <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> present with the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the overwhelming majority of the speech of the Salaf was against the Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. In fact, their speech against the Mu'attilah dwarfs their speech about the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, and this is plain and manifest when one surveys all the books authored by the Salaf on matters of creed in the second and third centuries against <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. The point we are leading to here then is that when this is the historical reality and when it is the case that the war of the Salaf was overwhelmingly against the Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, Allaah's Speech and the Qur'aan, the Ru'yah, and <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, then if a person was truly following the way of the Salaf, then he would have followed their way in writing his creed. <b>Which is detailed and specific <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation)</b>. However, because <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is in reality on the side of his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> ancestors, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who entered this <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> into the Ummah and through whom it came to the Ash'aris and Maturidis (after passing through the Kullaabiyyah), <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> has not followed the way of the Salaf at all, because he is in reality a disputant to the Salaf. If he did follow the Salaf as he claims, we would have seen an altogether different style and different content in the writing of his creed. Instead, he tried to remain as vague and general as possible, pretending to venerate and respect the way of the Salaf, focusing on negation (nafee) mostly, and the most he addressed, albeit very very indirectly, is the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah, and Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and ma'iyyah, and that is only because it is inevitable that he mention at least something without which his written creed would be devoid of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, and practically meaningless to the reader. </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Requesting <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> to Refute <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, Let Alone the Entirety of the Salaf</font>    <P>

So we would like <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> to show us on whose side he is in reality, with the Salaf and the early <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> or with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah:    <P>
Al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillaani said in al-Tamheed (full quote here in this article), refuting the Mu'tazilah:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>And if someone said: What has led you to deny that His Face and Hand is a limb when you do not understand hand as an attribute, and face as an attribute except [in the form of a] limb? It is said to him: That is not necessitated, just like it is not necessitated when we do not understand a living, knowing, able (being) except to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that we, us and you, should judge Allah with the same.</b>    <P>
And just like it is not necessitated when He is established by His own Essence (qaa'iman bi dhaatihi) that He is <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and body just because we, and you, do not find anything established by itself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi) in what we (outwardly) observe except that it is like that (i.e. <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Substance</font></a> and body).    <P>
And the answer to them is likewise if they say: It becomes necessary that His knowledge, life and speech <b><u>and all of His attributes belonging to His Essence (dhaat)</u></b> are non-essential incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), genuses, or occurrences (hawaadith), or changes, or coalesce (merge) in Him, or are in requirement of a heart, and they adduced the existence (wujood) [that they observe] as  argument [in this regard]</blockquote>    <P>
And this he took no doubt from Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who said, addressing the same doubt (in <i>al-Ibaanah</i>, ta&#7717;q&#299;q, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Ma&#7717;m&#363;d, Egypt, 1977, pp. 136-137):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Issue: And it is said to them: What has led you to reject that All&#257;h, the Exalted meant two hands by His saying, "<b>With my two hands (biyadayya)</b>" (38:75) and not two favours? If they say: Because if <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand) is not [with the meaning of] favour (ni&#703;mah) then it is but a limb (j&#257;ri&#7717;ah).    <P>
It is said to them: Why have you judged that if hand is not favour, then it is but a limb? ... They said: <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), when it is not favour in what is observed, it is but a limb. It is said to them: If you are working [on the basis] of what is observed [in creation] and you judged All&#257;h by way of it, then likewise, we do not find any living thing in the creation except as a body, flesh and blood.

Likewise, it is said to them: We do not find any mudabbir (controller), hak&#299;m (wise), except as a human, but then you affirm that the world has a mudabbir and &#7717;ak&#299;m who is not like a human, and you opposed what is observed [in the creation] and you contradicted your justification [in argument]. Therefore do not prevent from the affirmation of two hands that are not two favours or two limbs for the reason that it is opposed to what is observed. </blockquote>    <P>
What Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> intends here is: Don't deny the affirmation of two hands for All&#257;h upon the argument that if they are not two favours and not two limbs, then this opposes what is observed in creation, since we only know in what is observed, either hand as "favour", or hand as "a limb". So al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; is refuting this argument of the Mu&#703;tazilah and explains that you are in contradiction when you affirm other matters for All&#257;h, because the same argument equally applies there as well. And <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> took this affirmation from <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (see al-Maqaalaat), who himself was in agreement with the Salaf in these particular <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The difference here is that the Salaf affirmed the attribute of hand, face etc. and they employed general negation (by saying "without <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>," and "without how") and they did not say "not a limb", even though the meaning is correct, this because it is not from the deen of the Muslims to employ such specific negations for Allaah, except what Allaah Himself has negated specifically in what He revealed. But as for these early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, they agreed with the Salaf in the affirmation of these attributes, but had this methodological departure in their manner of speech by employing specific negations.</div>    <P>
With that clarified, it is clear that <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is just another conniving pretender, trying to be smart by presuming that a vague generalized statement in creed with the avoidance of tafseel (detail) is enough to pull the wool over the eyes of his audience. We would like to see which particular type of tanzeeh he is promoting, whether it is that of the Salaf, or that of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.     <P>
