<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Please do not proceed with this article unless and until you have read the series in sequence. In <b><a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>Part 1</a></b> we outlined a framework (indicating eleven groups to be aware of and to distinguish between), in <b><a href=index3639.html?emuan>Part 2</a></b> we established the true position of the Salaf and some from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, such as <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers in relation to 'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (those attributes known through revealed text alone). In <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 3</a></b>, we established that the Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were led to their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> respectively because they are operating upon <u>the same foundations</u>, which is the language of <u>al-ajsaam and al-a'araad</u> and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (origination of bodies). In this article and the next we are going to look at the sayings of the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, both groups of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Sources of Information</font>    <P>
We are going to rely upon these books:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/farq-bayn-al-firaq.gif border=1 border=0>  <img src=assets/images/baghdadi-usul-al-din.gif border=1 border=0>  <img src=assets/images/ashari-maqalat-islamiyyin.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
They are two books of <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H) an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar, <i><b>Usul al-Din</b></i> and <i><b>al-Farq bayn al-Firaq</b></i>, and Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari's (d. 324H) <i><b>Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen</b></i>. You can refer to the relevant entries in all these books under the Raafidah, and under the section on the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>. Rather than provide full translations of entire passages, we are going to provide summary statements which will be exact translations of sentences in any case.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>An important thing you have to keep in mind here, is that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself affirmed in this book, <b><i>al-Maqaalat</i></b>, the creed of the people of hadith and aathaar of affirming the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (face, hands, eyes, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, uluww) for Allaah, and states that he speaks with all of that. Just as <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> affirmed in his book <i><b>Usul al-Din</b></i> that from the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (meaning <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his earliest associates) were those who affirmed al-'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah. This is also acknowledged by <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>, al-Qushayree, and <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> affirmed face, hands, eye, asserting that these are definitely attributes of the essence, because it is impossible to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of all of the texts mentioning them, the wording simply makes it impossible. So he affirmed these attributes, claimed that these specific texts cannot admit to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, even if others can, given their context. You have to keep this in mind because it is a significant and crucial matter, and it will help you to reproduce what is going on in their minds as what is and what is not <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih and how they perceived and characterized the various factions and sects and their views. The allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> made by the pseudo-Ashari neo-Jahmites relies upon your ignorance of  history and what is found in the books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. If you don't wisen up a little you'll remain nothing but a plaything for your devious pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmi figureheads</blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding Definitions That Are Fabricated</font>    <P>
As we alluded to earlier in this series, in order to construct their theology, the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> fabricated their own definitions for terms, with meanings that have no basis in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or the language of the Arabs. Examples we gave [and some of which have been discussed in length in other articles (such as highlighting Naruiji's <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>academic frauds</a>)] include <i><b>al-ahad</b>, <b>al-waahid</b>, <b><a href='tags/al-tarkib.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-tarkib</font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></b></i>. In order to truly fathom what was going on with all of these theological debates you have to appreciate that the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are operating upon polluted language, and you have to be aware of this when you are speaking to people who have been poisoned and intoxicated with it.     <P>
<blockquote>With respect to the term <u><a href='tags/al-jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a></u>, it has two basic meanings. It refers to a) al-jasad, al-badan, the entity itself, whatever is being referred to, or b) the meaning of thickness,  density pertaining to an entity. That is its meaning in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and of the Arabs. To the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Mu'attilah or Mujassimah), they have their own devised definition for it, and their terms vary, some of them say, "<i>whatever consists of two indivisible particles</i>", and some say three, and some of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said <u>six</u> or <u>eight</u> (which means that extension would be in all three directions), and some of them said, "<i>whatever occupies space, a space occupying entity</i>", <i>"whatever has the three spatial extensions (length, breadth, depth)</i>", "<i>whatever can be pointed at</i>", "<b><i>whatever is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>, composed (murakkab, mu'allaf)</i></b>", that is one of their key ones. Also, <i>whatever is said about it that it is here or there</i>". And there is also "<i>whatever is etablished by itself (al-qaa'imu bi nafsihi)</i>", "<i>whatever exists (mawjood)</i>" (these last two are from <u>the Karraamiyyah</u>). </blockquote>    <P>
We have around twenty or so definitions amongst them.  What is important here, is that these people fabricated new meanings as a means to construct and validate their own theology [be they Mu'attilah or Mujassimah], which fundamentally is not based upon the principle of "Affirming for Allaah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him," rather, it is:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Proving the universe is originated with a proof based upon the conceptual tools and language of astray nations from the past then making reason (aql) the judge of what Allaah ought to be described with to conform to that proof and then making distortion of the texts that do not agree with that version of theism (because they imply <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> or hawaadith).</b></blockquote>    <P>
So they all formulated their own definitions, and they have many differences amongst themselves and they refute each other in these definitions.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>You would do well <u>to keep this in mind</u>, as this will help you grasp the realities, formulate the full picture, understand the sayings and orientations of each faction, and separate between them and operate upon justice, and when you have "got it", you should then be enraged for having had your mind toyed with by shysters and fraudsters who led you to falsely accuse innocent Muslims, let alone scholars, of what they are free of.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Raafidee <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, Mukayyifah, <a href="tags/mushabbihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mushabbihah</font></a></font>    <P>
Recall that the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were operating upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, like all the Mutakallimin, and they concluded Allaah is a body. And some of them inherited the deification of Ali (radiallaahu anhu) and others, and they mixed their <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> with tashbih and takyif. The three people in particular whose statements we will quote are from the kibaar (senior) of the Mutakallimin from the  Raafidah (the two Hishams and Dawud al-Jawaaribee). Refer to <i>al-Siyar</i> of <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> (10/544). All of these were in the mid to late second century hijrah, and they were involved in debate with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Hisham bin al-Hakam al-Rafidee (d. 218H)</font>    <P>
He is from the senior ones amongst the Mutakallimin amongst the Raafidah and he used to debate and refute the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and would write upon <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> upon <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
We will simply make summary translations of the essential points from our three sources above (and add comments). In general, these  Raafidah considered Allaah to be upon the form of a man, in both his dhaat (essence) and his <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes), and they added the language of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and takyif due to their <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, as they were also debating the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and were operating upon the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i>.     <P>
So this is what this vile Raafidee believed:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allah is a body with dimensions, he has height, breadth and depth (thickness), and all of these are equal (of equal height, breadth and depth). </blockquote>    <P>
These types of descriptions follow on from his affirmation that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> following on from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and thus, his descriptions are of a type that are the opposite of what is found with the Mu'attilah.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He claimed that what he worshipped was a difussing light, which shines like silver. It also possesses colour, taste, and smell, but all of these were the same (its colour is its taste and they are both its smell). So there is no separate attributes, rather the essence itself is colour and is taste. </blockquote>    <P>
So he is affirming types of attributes which Allaah is free of and have no basis in the revealed texts, and he is doing this upon the presumption that being a body, these attributes can be applicable to Him.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He said that Allah existed when there was no space, then He created space, which appeared for the first time, then He was in that space, and this space is His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. Some of the Hishamiyyah said that Allaah is over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He touches <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, that He does not extend beyond <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> does not extend beyond Him.</blockquote>    <P>
To the Raafidah, Allaah is already a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, and hence they indulged in takyif in relation to His 'uluww over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. It is for this reason, the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> refuted these Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> as they refuted the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> by saying "Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a jism" (<a href=index24b1.html?ddxry>see this article</a>)     <P>
You should notice here that the Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were not saying Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> <u>BECAUSE</u> He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Rather, they already held He was a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> on account of the proof of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad. Thereafter, they simply <u>made takyif</u> of how He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. This shows that being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> has no connection to the issue of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>, not to <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, not to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and not to their early followers from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. But this was made binding by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that if Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, He is <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), mahdud (confined, enclosed). And these Raafidah would come and oppose that baatil with their own baatil, that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and created a space which He then occupied it, since He cannot be but a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) which is nothing but a space-occupying entity (as defined by Ahl al-Kalam). As for affirming He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, this was affirmed by all factions, the Salaf, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the early <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, and likewise these Raafidah and all other factions. The only opposers were the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who were upon a Kalaami Bid'iyy negation. The Salaf were upon a Sunni, Athari affirmation (following what their Lord revealed). And the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were upon a Kalaami, Bid'iyy affirmation (sharing in the language and terms with the rest of Ahl al-Kalaam).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>For this reason, others from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, be they from those who affirm Allaah's 'uluww [Ibn Kullaab, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their early followers], or those who do not affirm 'uluww [later Ash'aris] refuted them in this takyif, and we will see these refutations in a future place in this series inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<blockquote>This is bearing in mind the difference between (<u>the early Kullaabis, early Ash'aris</u> and (<u>the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, Maturidis</u>) as to whether Allaah must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> <u>BECAUSE</u> He is said to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. The very early followers of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> <u>denied this</u> (as is clear in their refutations of the Raafidee and Hanafi Mujassimah) and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <u>claimed this</u>.     <P>
You will understand the reason for this from what we explained in <a href=index3639.html?emuan>an earlier article</a> that <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> never considered the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory, or the only way to prove Allaah's existence. Hence, they did not see affirmation of Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> to be problematic, as <i>huduth al-ajsam</i> was just one of numerous ways, and its necessities did not apply to, or necessarily clash with these aspects of belief. But the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> followed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in considering this proof to be obligatory and the only way to prove Allah's existence, and treating it as if Islam is invalid without it. So upon this, they receded into the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and opposed their early forerunners, <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. As for the Salaf, they never indulged in <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, as they considered it heresy, they were not operating upon this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</i> such that false necessities should arise in what they affirmed and spoke with.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Now, many of the statements you see coming from the Mu'attilah, such as the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, are in refutation of this type of takyif, and the difference between the early Kullaabis, Ash'aris is that they refuted this language of takyif whilst affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in agreement with the Salaf and in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, whilst the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> refuted this language of takyif whilst denying Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, in opposition to the Salaf and in agreement with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><u>Further</u>, you should also understand that what appeared on the tongues of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> mainly, "<i>Allaah created place, and Allaah is not in a place, He does not have a place</i>" and what is similar to this, they did not say this for no reason. When they saw their brethren in 'ilm al-kalaam saying what they were saying, like these Rafidees, that Allaah created a place, then occupied that created space, and when they saw the speech of their brethren in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> saying things like <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becomes filled by Allaah, and Allaah touches it and the likes, and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were saying Allaah is in all places, they retorted with the opposite speech, "Allaah has no place", and the very early Kullaabis, Ash'aris who affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> said, "without touch, contact" and what is similar to this of the opposite negation of the takyif of the brethren from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a>. So these statements and rebuttals are amongst themselves, but the Mu'attilah (with the exception of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their early followers) denied Allaah could be above, as this implies embodiment to them, and for this reason they rejected what is clear in the Book, Sunnah and consensus of the Salaf that Allaah is indeed above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. And so the position of every Sunni Muthabbit against these clowns is as follows:    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">Hey, you two groups of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, <b>Mu'attilah</b> and <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b>.

But don't you [Mu'attilah] try to tarnish us with the brown custard of your adversaries from your brethren in the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> and don't you [Mujassimah] try to tarnish us with the red custard of your adversaries from your brethren in the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. As we have not made any false analogies for our Lord, then the binding necessities you are implementing in either your <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negative theology) or your <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih do not apply to us, because we are sat way over here, enjoying our fresh pure milk, content, satiated and satisified. And we don't have any need for the leftovers [blood, puss, dung] of previous nations, the Hellenized Jews (an example of which is <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>), the Hellenized Christians (an example of which is <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>), the pseudo-Sabeans (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>) who all employed the conceptual tools and language of theology originating with Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers in order to prove the universe is originated and then restricted their entire language to what follows on from this proof, whilst throwing the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger behind their backs as mere presumptions of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih for the dumb commoners. We are very content with what our Lord revealed to us and what the Messenger brought of light, knowledge and guidance and have no need to enter into any of your refuse. So since we have not entered into it, its rules and necessities don't apply to us!</font></blockquote>    <P>
You see, when the Mu'attilah (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) attempt to tarnish Ahl al-Sunnah with the brown custard of their brethren, the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <u>it doesn't apply to us</u>, because we are not involved in their fight. We are not in their loony bin of <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, by which we mean al-ajsaam wal-a'raad and we do not admit to their claimed binding necessities as being applicable to Allaah in the first place. However, the Sunni who is not equipped with proper knowledge, he may not see this and not know how to respond to their doubts. But if he reads and re-reads this paper, he will see the reality of what they are doing and the reality of the fraud [of the Mu'attilah].</div>    <P>
More from the Raafidee Khabeeth:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Some said that Hisham described what he worshipped as being seven lengths of his own span, having estimated him according to humans who are generally seven times their own span. He stated that a mountain would be bigger than what he was worshipping. He said that that there must be a likeness between Allaah and created bodies otherwise He could not be pointed towards.</blockquote>    <P>
<b><u>A Very Important Issue</u></b>    <P>
The last sentence quoted above allows us to raise an extremely important issue. Notice here that both the Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> are working off the same premises. Pay attention:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li><u>The Mu'attilah</u> said: If Allaah is pointed towards He must be a body.   <li><u>The Mujassimah</u> said: Allaah must be a body for Him to be pointed towards.   </ul></div>    <P>
Notice the similarity in the underlying theoretical consideration. They are operating upon the same theoretical principles, and it is what they made the foundation of their respective theologies. You need to read <a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>the previous article</a> to understand this, as we highlighted this matter in detail there. Basically, they are all operating upon <u>the same false analogies</u> for Allaah. From these false analogies is that whatever lawaazim (binding necessities) apply to created beings must also apply to Allaah. Thus, Allaah is included amongst the genus of created things as it pertains to these binding necessities and thus all are spoken in the same way. Hence, if it is said "above" about a created thing this necessitates it must be a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body, then this same necessity must also be applicable to Allaah. Thus, Allaah has been entered into the genus of things about which this necessity is applicable. This is called <u>qiyas al-shumool</u> (analogy through inclusion), and this is baatil (false).    <P>
Compare this with what the Salaf and early <a href='tags/kullabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullabi <a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Asharis</font></a></font></a> said:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li><u>Ibn Kullaab, al-Ash'ari</u> said: Allah [Himself] is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a body. [This is specific affirmation with specific negation]. They denied that Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> necessitates being a body, because they rejected the laazim (binding necessity), and they did not consider the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory or the only way to prove the universe is originated.   <li> <u>The Salaf</u> said: Allah [Himself] is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> bila kayf. [This is specific affirmation with general negation].</ul></div>    <P>
To help understand the differences between all these sayings, it is best explained with diagrams representing the angle each faction is coming from, first Ahl al-Sunnah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qiyas-shumul-ahl-al-sunnah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>Explanation:</b> Ahl al-Sunnah do not permit false analogies for Allaah such that the lawaazim (binding necessities) applying to created things can be extended to Him by including Him with the genus of created things in relation to the applicability of these lawaazim (binding necessities). Thus if it is said that "<i>anything said to be above must be a composed body</i>" and "<i>a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body [occupying space] must be pointed towards</i>," such rules only apply to created things. Allaah is other than created things, hence these rules and necessities cannot be extend to Him, <u>since the reality of His essence is unknown</u>. Therefore, dependence is only upon the language in what He revealed, since He is the most-knowledgeable of His own self and the most eloquent in conveying what it is He wants believed about Himself to the generality of mankind, and this has been conveyed through all revealed Books. Hence, Allaah [Himself] is above the seventh heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, [just as He said], without asking how. This does not necessitate He is a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body [upon the language of ahl al-kalaam], but we do not express such a negation as it is innovated language, <u>since takyif in negation is erroneous just like takyif in affirmation</u>. So  Ahl al-Sunnah have <u>wholesome pure milk</u>, leading to sound constitution in body and mind with perfect agreement between authentic text and sound reason. As for the difference between the Salaf and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (in the days he was a Kullaabi), then the Salaf made specific affirmation and general negation, whereas the early Kullabiyyah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>  made specific affirmation and specific negation in this matter.    <P>
Next, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and all their offshoots [Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, Maturidis]:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qiyas-shumul-jahmiyyah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>Explanation:</b> There is a theoretical consideration underlying the proof of huduth al-ajsaam which all these factions are operating upon (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Later <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) which is that the lawaazim (binding necessities) applying to created things extend to Allaah, and Allaah is included amongst them from this perspective to allow the lawaazim to be applied, and the theology to be built. If this were not the case, then <u>their entire theology would collapse</u>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>You need to just to stop here and give this points its due right and consideration. This is essentially a Hiroshima under the pseudo-Ash'ari neo-Jahmite fraudsters' edifice. After penetrating the stratosphere, they are now hurtling back towards earth. So you really need to stop and get this into your head so you understand the reality of where they are operating from. In fact most of them would not even know themselves.</b></div>    <P>
So to continue, this is because their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> - which consists of series of  negations,  negating Allaah to be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and the genus of incidental attributes or some of the incidental attributes [upon the differences between themselves] - their language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is founded upon this theoretical premise, which is that Allah admits to these lawaazim being applicable to Him. Hence, if Allah is said to be "above" He must be a body (as is said of all created things). This leads to negation of Allaah being "above" (and the same with other attributes) in order to maintain their version of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>. This "negative theology" is founded entirely upon the false analogy upon which they are operating. Without making that qiyas al-shumul for Allaah, this theology would not hold and could not exist. Hence, Allaah has to be entered within the genus of created things in terms of accepting the lawaazim (binding necessities) that apply to them, on the basis of which the negative theology arises. Take away that false analogy, and this theology has no foundation any more.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">The point here is that the theology of the Mu'attilah, in its very core, its innermost secret, is greatest underlying platform, principle, premise, is that Allaah must be included within the genus of all created things in order to allow the lawaazim (that are said of <i>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</i>) to apply to Him, which then allow the subsequent language of theology to be justified (a series of negations, denying <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> and and its properties, to the Mu'attilah and a series of affirmations, affirming <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> and its properties, to the Mujassimah). They are <u>Mushabbihah, Mujassimah</u> in reality, in the very theoretical foundations. Take away this false analogy (<i>qiyas al-shumul</i>) and the entire edifice comes crumbling down and its like "<i>Dude! Where's my theology???!</i>" And the answer is "<i>That's right Dude! You don't have any!!</i>"    <P>
You will also do well to understand the very insightful saying of the Scholars <u>every Mu'attil is a Mushabbih</u> in light of the above.</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
In conclusion, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots have nothing but blood and puss. We can now look at the Raafidees (a word of warning, it stinks!)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qiyas-shumul-mujassimah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>Explanation:</b> Now the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> have already argued Allaah can only be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), since there are only ajsaam (bodies) and their incidental attributes and Allaah cannot be an incidental attribute so He can only be a body. It is important to realize here that <b>they started off with this conclusion</b>. Thereafter, all of their language of <u>tashbih</u> and <u>takyif</u> follows on from this conclusion. This conclusion is from their rendering of the proof using the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i>. Hence, if Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), He is of a given length, width, breadth, and so on,  and He is of a particular size and so on, and He has color, taste, smell and so on, and He is a space-occupying entity (since the very definition of the <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> with <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> is "a space-occupying entity"). Thus everything that is from the properties  of a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (i.e. as defined by Ahl al-Kalaam), can be said of Allaah. Like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots, they made the lawaazim (binding necessitites) pertaining to created things admissible for Him and it is from this angle they say, "<i>Since He is a body, He must be pointed towards</i>." You need to understand the reality of where they are coming from and what premises they are operating upon, and what the real angle of their view is, and exactly what their tashbih and takyif springs and originates from. What these <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> have with them is dung (we did warn you).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>This is all very different to what is with Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf [pure milk in between the blood and dung], and likewise <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, al-Muhasibee, al-Qalaanisee, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their very early followers in terms of what they were upon in this matter, that Allaah [Himself] is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, that the believers raise their hands in supplication to Him, that Jibril and the Angels ascend to and descend from Him and what is besides that in the Book and the Sunnah which all of them used to refute the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. What makes Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, is that He revealed this knowledge and said as such Himself, as did His Messenger (alayhis salaam). And since we do not allow false analogies for Allah, and since our creed is not built upon corrupt theoretical foundations and premises (<i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> and their <i>lawaazim</i>), then there are no binding necessities that we are obligated to accept or which anyone can impose upon us. We simply say Allah is indeed above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and we make no further tahdeed (definition in words) in this matter unless it is something that has come in a revealed text itself or is from the Salaf.</blockquote></div>    <P>
We continue with the vile sayings of the Raafidee:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He said Allaah can only see by way of rays that come from Him and touch and penetrate the earth, and unless the rays touched what was behind the various creatures and bodies He cannot see them. Hisham bin al-Hakam also said that Allah only knows things after not knowing them, and that Allaah's knowledge is an attribute, but it is neither identical to Him, nor other than Him, and nor is it a part of Him. He also said that an attribute cannot have an attribute. Hence, he said it can't be said about Allaah's attribute of knowledge, that it is "eternal" or "created." He said the same thing about the attributes of power (qudrah), life (hayat), wish (iradah), hearing (sam'), seeing (basr), they can't be said to be "created" or "eternal" because of his view that an attribute can't have attributes. But about these attributes he said they are the same as Allaah Himself (synonymous with the essence). He said Allah cannot have had eternal knowledge, since that requires the object or thing to be known to already exist, which means all known things would be eternal.He also said that if Allaah knew all the deeds of His servants it would invalidate the free will and religious duty would be invalidated. About the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> he said it is not a creator [this is to be understood in light of him making attributes the same as the essence], nor created, and it can not  be said about it "not created" because this is an attribute and an attribute [Allah's speech] cannot be described with other attributes. </blockquote>     <P>
We see here a mixture of things and even the approaches of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in making some attributes synonymous with the essence.  You see these people had multiple influences, they were debating others too, which explain why they had such a messed up idea of what it is they are worshipping.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Hisham bin Salim al-Jawaaleeqee</font>    <P>
This is another Raafidee, and there was also a sect called <a href='tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a> after him. These are his views:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He claimed that what he worshipped is in the form of a man, but without being flesh and blood, that his deity is a diffused white light.

He claimed that his upper half is hollow and the lower half is solid, and that his object of worship has black hair, being made of black light, whereas the rest is white light. </blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He said his deity is a body in the form of a human with flesh and blood and said his upper half is hollow and lower half is solid. That he has curly hair. However he claimed it is a body unlike the bodies and flesh unlike the fleshes and blood unlike the bloods. He said, "Pardon me for the beard and private parts, but ask me about anything else." Which means he makes takyif of Allaah based on what is observed creation, but wishes to remain silent about the beard and private parts. Lofty and exalted is Allaah from the sayings of this vile Rafidee!</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Other Factions</font>    <P>
There are numerous other factions mentioned, from them, the Khattaabiyyah who ascribed divinity to Abu al-Khattaab al-Asadee. the Mugheeriyyah, followers of al-Mugheerah bin Sa'eed al-Ijlee who said his deity has limbs which are in the form of the letters of the alphabet! And the Bayaaniyyah, followers of Bayaan bin Sam'aan  who said that his deity is in the form of a human, made of light.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Discussion, Comments and Notes</font>    <P>
We see amongst the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> a mixture of <b>a)</b> deification of humans, giving Allah a human form, and then <b>b)</b> the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> as it relates to <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and <b>c)</b> something of the approaches of the Mu'attillah. These views came from the Mutakallimin amongst them and they had argued (just like the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> we will be looking at next), through the language of <i>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</i> (bodies and their incidental attributes) - as part of the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> - that Allaah must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (i.e. <u>as defined by the Mutakallimin</u>) - pay attention to this last bit - a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> as defined by the Mutakallimin. Hence, when they described Him, they described Him with relevant language, such as He has breadth, width, height, color, taste, smell and so on. This was the opposite of the language of the Mu'attilah (Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not this, not that and so on). This is <u>in addition</u> to their gross tashbih. Further, in their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> debates with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and others, they would also adopt some of the usool found with the Mu'attilah, such as making the attributes (most of them) to be synonymous with the essence, like they did with life, power, wish, hearing, seeing. So what we are seeing are in fact a mixture of influences, tashbih (between  Allaah's dhaat and <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> with those of the creation), and <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and some <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which resembles that of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
Also a crucial thing you need to distinguish in your mind here as well is that just because the Raafidah affirm something that the Salaf (and the early Kullabi Ash'aris) affirmed [i.e. Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, Allaah has face, hands etc.], then this affirmation does not make it tashbih. Since tashbih is to say "<i>Hand like my hand, face like my face, hearing like my seeing</i>" and so on. The mere affirmation is not tasbhih, as is established from the Salaf like <u>al-Tirmidhi</u>, <u>Nu'aym bin Hammad</u>, <u>Ishaq bin Raahooyah</u> and the generality of the Imaams. The tashbih that the Salaf warned against was likening Allaah's attributes to those of the creation in their realities - which is what these Rafidah fell into, after they treated Allaah's dhaat to be like that of the humans and after they deified some amongst mankind. Further, they affirmed attributes Allah did not affirm for Himself and which are unique to humans, such as a heart, black hair, nose, mouth and so on. So there is tasbhih (in essence and attributes, even if those attributes have proof for them), and excess in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (with attributes that have no proof) and making tashbihh with respect to them too.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">As for the <u><a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a></u> which is meant by <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, that is in relation to philosophical speech about bodies (ajsaam) upon their fabricated definitions (space occupying entities, consisting of two or more atoms providing spatial extension in one, two or three dimensions and so on) - then the Salaf <u>never knew anything</u> of this and they never spoke of this type of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> or warned from it, because this is unique to <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a>, on account of which the Mu'attilah had a certain language, and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> had a certain language (as you can clearly see above and as you will see with the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> in the next article inshaa'Allaah). In any case, everyone who indulged in <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> was condemned by the Salaf, and the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> condemned by the Salaf was this particular kalam, that of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> which led all of these people astray. So the Salaf never had any words in relation to this <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>, because they never indulged in this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> at all such that they said to anyone who said Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, "<i>Be silent! Don't you know this is direction which means location which means space-occupation, which is nothing but embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>)</i>." So walhamdulillah, this deception [regarding tajsim] is uncovered.</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
So with this :- And we are not finished yet - because <u>the fourth piece in our toolset</u> has not yet been unleashed, and we suggest that you keep a sound-recorder ready, because hearing those effeminate wails, screams and shouts from the <i>makhaaneeth</i> of the neo-Jahmiyyah operating upon centuries of calculated deception - when we start pounding their doubts - will be a moment written down in history, and you want to make sure you capture it for antiquties sake.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baseball-bats.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<u>So with this</u>, we say that as true historical fact, and the true context of things are slowly emerging and the deception is unravelling, we advise everyone to keep their eyes peeled for any pied-piper <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who will try to <u>flee the scence</u> once the game is up. If you do see them and apprehend them, a small cash reward along with other goodies will be offered upon delivery to us, and we look forward to implementing justice upon them (by smashing their doubts).  <P>
