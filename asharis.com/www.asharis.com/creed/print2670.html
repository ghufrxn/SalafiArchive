<img src=assets/images/demolition-wall.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0><font class='titleHeadline'>Bring Down the Walls</font>    <P>
We're going to start <u>bringing down the walls (of deception)</u> in this article, inshaa'Allaah, but first we need to make some clarifications. When we use the word "<b>Ash'arite Heretics</b>" you must remember that "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" is of types, and is not a monolithic, uniform creed. What we mean by "Jahmite <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Heretics" are the contemporary followers of those who cut off and had little connection with <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and took the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> way into the direction of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and they are <u><a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a></u> (d. 478H), <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u> (d. 505H), <u><a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a></u> (d. 606H) and <u>al-Amidee</u> (d. 631H). This is the "engine" and "core" of today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now these scholars, we consider them to have been misguided, astray, in opinion, in areas of belief and approach - even if some of them are said to have recanted at the end of their lives, abandoning <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> - yet that is between them and Allaah [and we ask Allaah to pardon them], and their misguidance is what needs to be pointed out, since a large portion of the ummah inherited it from them. Whilst they may be excused for being caught up in something that can be said to be a fitnah that enveloped the Ummah and caught many a righteous god-fearing scholar, and they are now bygone, the point is that <u>there is no excuse</u> for today's <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> in following those scholars in their errors. The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> strengthened in following the usool of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> since the time of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and for this reason they were refuted appropriately with the title "<i>Bayaan Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</i>." </div>    <P>
So today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have no connection with <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (d. 324H) himself and likewise no connection to the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> like <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a> (d. 380H) and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H). Read this article for more details on this subject    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The Levels and Ranks of Ash'arism or Those To Whom It is Ascribed </b>- An Important Classification And Exposition of the Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Posing as 'Asharis' - (<a href=index2046.html?cmwje>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
However, there are <u>two layers</u> by which this <b>inner core</b> and <b>central machinery</b> is concealed and attachments and associations are made to either  of these two layers so as not to reveal the filling in the middle.     <P>
<blockquote>Hence, you will see the contemporary <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> associating with the <u>first lower layer</u>, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, despite the fact that they rely upon <u>NONE</u> of his existent works written towards the end of his life, such as <i>al-Mujiz</i>, <i>Risalah ilaa Ahl al-Thaghar</i>, <i>al-Maqaalaat</i>, and  <i>al-Ibaanah</i> in knowing how his creed evolved towards that of Ashab al-Hadith at the end of his life. So it is just mere use of the  name. This is <u>very different</u> to the likes of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, and Abu Uthman al-Sabuni and others who were amongst those who <u>on account of what was in the book al-Ibaanah</u>, sometimes displayed association with <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and that association was on the basis of what he manifested of agreeing with <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> at the end of his affair. So take note of this crucial matter and beware of the  trickery and deception of the conniving <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of today posing as "Ash'arites." Likewise they are not really into <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> that much either for reasons that become clear from the many articles we have on him on this site (<a href=tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html>see here</a>). So this is the lower layer.    <P>
The <u>second upper layer</u> which conceals the filling in the middle is that made up of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar. Now these Scholars did not delve into the heretical kalam but they were convinced of the conclusions of the Mutakallimin without really knowing the inner realities, and thus, they tried to merge their knowledge of hadith, with these conclusions, and thus you will see strange things from them. They censured the Mutakallimin for indulging in that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and speech of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, and for what they made to the be the first obligation (al-nadhar wal-istidlaal) and the likes [<a href=index8c76.html?ublmv >see this article</a> about Ibn Hajar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> on this matter], yet they spoke with <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid, having considered the conclusions of the Mutakallimin to be correct. This is because they grew up in an environment and era where this was the only way known, and they considered the conclusions of the Mutakallimin to be the truth, and they did not truly distinguish between the sayings of the various factions (and this is clear in the writings of Ibn Hajar especially), and so merged between those conclusions and what was found in the ahaadeeth. They would often speak of the way of the Salaf through this particular orientation and influence, although at times they would clearly acknowledge that the way of the Salaf was different to what they held (see <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>this example</a> and <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>this one</a> from al-Qurtubi). Hence, this upper layer is ideal for confusing people and presentng a "good" face for pseudo-Ash'ariyyah and for calling the people to it. And what they are  doing is lending credibility to the way of <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and al-Aamidee through the expertise of the likesof <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar in the field of hadith. The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> they are really calling to is not that of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, since they no longer have any knowledge-based connection to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself, not even to the Kullabi period in his life. Rather, it is the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> of <u>tajahhum</u>, <u>i'tizal</u> and <u><a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a></u>, that of <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and al-Aamidee - the inner core, the machinery, and the filling.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In this article we will be taking a glance at a research paper (an example of many, at a cost of $40 per paper to us) to get an idea of the true roots and origins of the theology of the Mutakallimun (speculative theologians), meaning the condemned Ahl al-Kalam, and they are the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, the <u>Rafidi Hishamiyyah Mujassimah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Karraamiyyah Mujassimah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u> and the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>.

<img src=assets/images/monopolar-theism-paper-a.gif border=0>    <P>
The paper is dealing with monopolar theism and dipolar theism in the background of the ontological argument (a proof used to demonstrate the existence of God). The question of monopolar theism and dipolar theism, to put it in the simplest terms possible, is whether God is a remote, unattached, immutable, unresponsive being (monopolar), or is He is responsive, interacting with His creation (dipolar). This is the course of the discussion, but we just want to highlight certain areas of the paper to allow us to compare between what is cited regarding those <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> and from those Christians who were affected by their philosophy in trying to formulate a proof for God. The author of the paper is discussing the philosophical views of a modern Christian writer who is critiquing the "classical theism" of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>. Bear in mind that Christians are "<a href="tags/mujassimah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mujassimah</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/mushabbihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mushabbihah</font></a>", they make permissible upon Allaah that which is baatil, such as that He is a "suffering" God and that this is from the discussed "dipolar" theism which opposes the monopolar theism represented in the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> and those following their way. However, leaving all that aside, <u>what concerns us from this paper</u> is the characterization of the classical theism which came from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, and we've chosen to do it from third party, research papers so that there can be no accusations of mischaracterizing anything.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font class='titleHeadline'>A Brief History of the Theology of Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font>    <P>
<blockquote><p>Remember, that the proof of <u>huduth al-ajsaam</u> (origination of bodies) was taken by al-Ja'd bin Dirham from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers, the remnants of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> to whom Ibrahim (alayhis salaam) was sent and they were versed in the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies. Amongst them were those who <u>still believed</u> in the origination of the universe. In order to demonstrate and argue the case, they devised this proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and this was based upon their study of the natural sciences, of the observable universe, upon the philosophical terms, classifications and introspection that came from the likes of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, and in particular the classification of his Ten Categories, (<u>al-Maqulat al-Ashar</u>) which were the <u>linguistic foundations</u> for his syllogistic and deductive logic to validate the truth and falsehood of propositions. So the language of al-jawaahir, al-ajsaam (substances, bodies) and al-a'raad (their incidental attributes) was the underlying language and foundation for this proof. As a result of this, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> used to practice "negative theology" which means to affirm only negatives for Allaah which is to say, "<i>Allah is not this, nor that, nor this, nor that...</i>", and this was to avoid <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> for Allaah and to maintain His "transcendence" and the likes. In reality, their belief in the divine simply followed the theism of Plato and <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>.  <b>Al-Ja'd bin Dirham</b> brought this into the Ummah and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (divestment) was innovated. Al-Ja'd was trying to remain consistent with this proof, which means <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions must be denied, since a) names implying attributes, and b) attributes and c) actions have been used as evidence that the bodies they reside in or are said of, are originated.     <P>
Hence, he claimed Allaah did not speak to Moses because according to the proof this would a haadithah (event, occurrence) in Allaah's essence, which is only said of bodies (ajsaam). Likewise, Allaah did not take Ibrahim as His friend, again for the same reason. Likewise affirming hearing, seeing, power, life, will, face, hands, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and so on are tajsim, they necessitate Allaah is a body, because they are attributes and actions.     <P>
This theology was taken up by <b>the Jahmiyyah</b> who promulgated it in the Ummah. Then it was taken up by Amr bin Ubayd for <b>the Mu'tazilah</b> during the time of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> who spoke against it. By the third century (after 200H), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had refined this proof a great deal and  they put the Ummah to trial with the saying that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, which was a belief necessarily required by the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> subdued and overcame these nasty heretics, and the people at large turned away from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, seeing their demise. Then came <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> who tried to debate these <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> with <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and fell prey to their doubts regardign Allaah's actions. After him came <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who had left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to support the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> just after the beginning of the fourth century (300H), but neither of these two considered this proof to be obligatory, which explains why they (and the very early Kullaabi Ash'aris) were closer to Ahl al-Sunnah in their views.     <P>
But when <b><a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></b> came along, he made this proof of huduth al-ajsaam integral to what he saw as his own support and formalization of the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and he reproduced it in detail in his book al-Tamhid, all of it being identical more or less to its treatment by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>,and he declared it obligatory (waajib) upon everyone. Desipte this, he still held fast to many of al-Ash'aris positions. However, when all of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> after him spoke of this proof - and it is found in all of their books - they eventually realized that this proof is flawed. Debates had raged between them and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and when the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> realized this proof is corrupt, flawed and can equally be used to prove that the universe is eternal (which was referred to some of them as <i>takaafu' al-adillah</i>, equality in evidences), they hastened to protect themselves and conceal this vulnerability in their theology by incorporating other proofs which actually originated with the very <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> they were debating with, the proofs of <u>tarkib (composition)</u> and <u>takhsis (specification)</u>. The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> incorporated these into their own theology (leading to a hybridization of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and falsafah) and very unscrupulously began to use them in their polemics against Ahl al-Sunnah. Now this last point is a whole different subject and inshaa'Allah we will follow up on this in other articles where we will, by Allah's permission, take our infamous sandal (<a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>see towards the end of this article here</a>) and slap that intellectual cripple and mental spastic, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> till he is black and blue inshaa'Allaah, to make an example and sign out of him, and as an announcement to all other other intellectual fraudsters that the sandal will be pursuing them too in due course, by Allaah's permission.</blockquote> </div>    <P>

<img src=assets/images/cloud-cuckoo-land.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=1 border=0> If you have grasped the history above, you will understand why today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are <u>the most intellectually and mentally confused, garbled, bewildered, confounded people you will ever come across</u>, who in their wild and drunken stupor, stumble onto blogs, forums, muttering "<i>not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makaan, not in tahayyuz, not below, not above, not inside, not outside...</i>" - and they don't realize they are following the foundations of theology of the Greek and Sabean star and idol worshipping pagan disbelievers, not the revealed Books and sent Messengers - may Allaah guide these lost and poor souls, ameen. You have to excuse even the students of knowledge amongst them, because they are just as bewildered, its not just exclusive to the common folk, even their Shaykhs are bewildered. You see as  history developed after the Mutakallimun found this newfangled approach, thinking they just came upon a treasure by which to defend the truth, books were written and a whole theology was buit upon it and Islam itself was now dependent upon this [flawed, corrupt] proof. So many a generation were brought up on it and this continued in succession to this day. Unfortunately those today who have had their minds affected with this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, cannot see outside of the box they are stuck in.     <P>

This is no doubt a question that arises, and this is the truth of the matter: There were a category of Scholars who never actually delved into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, al-ajsaam wal-a'raad (bodies and their incidental attributes), huduth al-ajsaam (arguing for the origination of bodies through the presence of attributes and actions in them), al-juzz alladhee laa yatajazzaa' and <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle), al-arad laa yabqaa zamaanayn (an incidental attribute does not last two instants of time)  and all that other useless unnecessary speech, the condenmed ilm al-kalaam, which was taken <u>DIRECTLY</u> from  the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (be in absolutely no doubt about that at all, it is a FACT - <a href=index27ca.html?mrgly>see here as an example</a>). However, they were led to believe in <u>the correctness of the conclusions</u> of those Mutakallimin who did delve into it. And this is understandable because  when you also had amongst the Ahl al-Kalaam the Rafidi Hishaamiyyah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> [who were saying Allaah is a body, in flesh and bones, or He must be a body to have attributes, and other statements like this] then these Scholars believed in the correctness of the conclusions of those Mutakallimin, even if they did not actually delve into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> like those Mutakallimin did. Then, because they were mostly attached to hadeeth, they tried to reconcile between those conclusions they held to be valid and what they found in the hadeeth and aathaar. And you see this from the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and then much later, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> who were with the Mutakallimin. And likewise Ibn Hajar, who is a category on his own. Also in this category is <u><a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a></u>, because he also held the validity of the usool of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> regarding Allaah's chosen actions [what the Mutakallimin deny as hawaadith (events, occurrences)], but he also made excessive <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) for Allaah based on fabricated narrations, then he tried to reconcile between that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> he was influenced by and those ahaadeeth he affirmed and entered into tafwid. The end result was that there were the later scholars who wrongly thought the way of the Salaf was <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid on account of the propagation of the way of the Mutakallimin, particularly the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> between the sixth to eighth centuries (500H-700H) and so they approached the hadeeth and aathaar with this perception. However, because they never actually delved into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> you will not see from these scholars the deep-rooted <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> like what was seen from <u><a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></u>, <u>al-Baghdadi</u> and <u><a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a></u>, and likewise that <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> [and sometimes zandaqah] in opinion and speech that came from the likes of  <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u> and <u><a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a></u> (both got diseased reading the books of Ibn Sina) and <u>al-Aamidee</u> - and these later ones are the actual Scholars who consolidated and standardized the theology that all later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon, the <u>Jahmi, I'tizaali, Falsafi</u> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, far removed from what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was upon.

But they only assumed the correctness of those conclusions and approached the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Hadith upon this incorrect perception. Be in no doubt about that, and when they wish to call people to their belief, they present this upper layer to the people...</blockquote>    <P>
With this history - and this is indeed the reality of the affair - it is no longer permissible for any contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> to argue for the correctness of his way, rather his way is baatil (as will be clear by the end of this article), and trying to attach oneself to and use the names and writings of these scholars (al-Bayhaqi, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar) is nothing but <u>pure deception</u> - since it is haraam to follow the error of a scholar once that error is established and once historical fact is known and proven.</div>    <P>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>    <P>
Theism (belief in a God) was spoken of by the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> who were pagans, disbelievers in Allaah, far, far away from Prophethood, and who spoke without light and guidance, and all of their speech in this field was essentially  a mirage, nothing pure abstactions, and they ended up with an idea of a God whose existence is really only in the mind, not an actualy true and real existence in external reality. This "<i>perfect, immutable (unchanging) transcendent being</i>"  of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> affected the theology of the mutakallimeen from the Jews, Christians and Muslims.     <P>
With respect to the Muslims, whilst the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) argued with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (al-Kindin, a-Farabi, Ibn Sina) on the issues of the eternity of the universe, prophethood, resurrection, their ideas on the divine, as in the actuality of Allaah, overlapped with each other (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here for an example</a> between <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and Ibn Sinaa), and this was because the Mutakallimin unfortunately accepted certain premises in the language and foundations of debate which were used in their argument for the universe being originated against those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. As a result of this they were forced to adhere to its necessities (lawaazim), and so each faction (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) held on to what it believed were the binding necessities of this proof. The disputes between the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are really only secondary disputes on this matter, after their agreement on the foundation. As a result, their belief in Allaah and their theological language became similar in many respects to that of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> even if they debated and fought them on the issues of the eternity of the universe, resurrection, and prophethood. It was this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, this particular proof of huduth al-ajsaam (and not the genus of kalaam), that the Salaf, like <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik, Shaafi'ee and Ahmad severely condemned and declared its practitioners as heretics.    <P>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>    <P>
The saying "<i>without body, parts and passions</i>" is transposed onto the saying of the Mutakallimin, "<i>He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, 'arad</i>" and as for "passions", what they mean are attributes such as love, pleasure, anger and the likes, and this is based upon two of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> Categories called action (fi'l, yaf'al) and affection (infi'aal, yanfa'ilu) - [see opening of <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?kwqku>this article</a>]. You see these Mutakallimin failed to understand the limits of reason in that whilst reason can establish the existence of a Creator, it cannot then be used to be the judge as to how that existence is except through revelation and what Allaah informs about Himself. However, they transgressed, and allowed themselves to be poisoned by aspects of the theism of those <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, even if they differed with them on other matters [whether the universe is eternal or not, is resurrection real, is revelation real, is prophethood real]. As a result they let reason invalidate the details of revelation, even if they had used that same reason to affirm it in priniciple - and this was from the greatest of their follies.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The Reality of the Kalam Theologist is Self-Falsification:</b>     <P>
<blockquote><p>An illustration here is that of a man called Zayd who testifies about another man, Abdullah, that he is truthful and does not lie. Then he testifies that Abdullah has lied. This now becomes a revilement and complete invalidation of his (Zayd's) first testimony and his second one. Both his (i.e. Zayd's) first and second testimony are now no longer obligatory to accept because he has contradicted and discredited his own testimony. And this is the case with the Mutakallim&#363;n, they used reason to establish the truth of the Qur&#702;&#257;n and the prophethood of Mu&#7717;ammad (alayhis salaam), and then they used the same reason to claim what has come in the revealed texts is tashb&#299;h, tajs&#299;m and plain manifest kufr upon how the natives of the language who are being addressed would have understood upon what is normal in their linguistic usage. This is like Zayd testifying to the truthfulness of Abdullah, and after completing this testification, saying Abdullah has lied in what he has informed and that the truth is in the speech of other than him. To be true to sound, uncorrupted reason (aql), once they had established the veracity of revelation and prophethood (as they claim), being true to that reason necessitates that you now submit - in the details of what Allaah is described with - to the authority of that very revelation whose veracity and absolute truthfulness you have just proven and argued for! It is not for your reason (aql) to subsequently challenge it and claim its language is tajsim and tashbih and needs to be distorted in order to establish the true and real <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and tanzih, as they claim, because by saying this, you have actually invalidated your own reason (aql). And this tanzih they are speaking of is that "immutable transcendence" which is but the abstract theism of the Greek and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their theological language about what is divine and what is not and their language of "negative theology". In this case you've just falsified yourself and destroyed your argument, and made yourself a laughing stock - and inshaa'Allaah, we will demonstrate in a separate forthcoming article how <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> - who was shrewder than the Mutakallimin, even if he was a great disbeliever and  more misguided - gave these Mutakallimin such a beating and pasting in argument, they've still not recovered from it till today and they still can't answer it. </blockquote>    <P>

<img src=assets/images/monopolar-theism-paper-d.gif border=0>    <P>
<b><u>Commentary</u></b>    <P>
These phrases here "<i>eternal, immutable, transcendent</i>" constitute the same language of the Mutakallimin, and what they mean here is to deny Allah's names, attributes, and His actions (upon the varation between them) and likewise to deny He is above His creation, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and likewise to deny that He speaks with actual speech and to deny that He will be seen in the Hereafter with the vision of the eyes. The word "immutable" means not subject to change (taghyir), and this means denial of action (fi'l) and affection (infi'aal) in accordance with Aristotle's Categories.  This is the basis of the rejection of Allaah's chosen actions (sifaat fi'liyyah, af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah), they consider them to be from the imperfections of created bodies.     <P>
So they opposed what is established in revelation on account of the reason (aql) of a kafir, mushrik, worshipper of stars and idols, and then claimed this is tanzih (transcendence), but this is the tanzih of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and His likes, it is not the tanzih of <u>the Prophets, Messengers and Ahl al-Sunnah</u> from this Ummah which is the denial of any likeness and resemblance from whatever He affirmed for Himself - and not the very negation of what He affirmed for Himself on account of a corrupt, impure, diseased 'aql (intellect).     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for the attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself such as pleasure and anger and love and the likes, then they are tied to His will and power, and He chooses to be angry, or pleased and His anger and pleasure is not like the involuntary anger and pleasure of the creation and thus affection (infi'aal) in this sense is denied for Allaah, but it is not denied that Allaah becomes pleased and angry according to His will. And what we see in the language of the star and idol-worshipping <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> of "immutability", "transcendence" and the likes is all from the perspective of denying Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, [in addition to denying His attributes]. This of course is the origin of the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that hawaadith (events, occurrences) are negated from Allaah. As we have said earlier, if reason ('aql) establishes the existence of Allaah and the veracity of revelation, and we do not deny it can, then it is from this very reason, that this reason submit to the revelation in knowing Allaah, as in His names, attributes and actions and accept that with full submission. Thus, there is a difference between reason proving He "exists" and between reason being the judge of what He subsequently can and can't be - that is only the role of revelation - even if we accept that reason can very limitedly affirm some of what Allah is described with (life, knowledge, power, will, mercy, wisdom and the likes).</div>    <P>
So we see here the true and real foundations of the speech of the Mutakallimin, and you will see this orientation and this particular choice of words - and an  example of this is how Hamza Yusuf distorted the creed of al-Tahawi to be in line with this particular version of theism which is shared between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Mutakallimin - even if wars raged between them on separate issues like the universe being eternal or originated, resurrection and prophethood. You will also see this choice of language very clearly from these people, the likes Hamza Yusuf, <a href='tags/nuh-keller.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuh Keller</font></a>, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> and other <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of the era, and don't be surprised that most of these people are often Christian converts coming from a background of Western philosophical heritage which prides itself upon the Greek philosophy that shaped it so much. In fleeing from Christianity, they were unable to escape the shackles of that classical Greek theism which led them to something of excess in denying for Allaah what He and His Messengers (alayhim as salaam) affirmed for Him.    <P>
So the point here is that <b>do not let that historical enmity between them (Philosophers and Ahl al-Kalaam) blind you</b> into not seeing that in reality, they are united in how they actually speak about Allaah. Pay attention to this (and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see an example of it here</a> between <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and Ibn Sina) you will find little difference between them in the foundations of their speech regarding Allaah, rather,their differences are only in subsidiary details in that regard. This is also why that as centuries went by, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> [and Maturidis] in particular no longer considered the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to be their enemies, and they saw no harm in hybridizing their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> when they saw the flaws in their proof of huduth al-ajsaam and when they saw that both kalam and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> actually have the same objectives. This is said by the likes of <a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a> (d. 791H) in his book Sharh al-Maqaasid. Rather, they turned all of their enmity towards Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of revealed Books and the sent Messengers.    <P>

You heard it from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and their later tail-ends the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. You heard it from kafirs like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and then you read it in the books of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and others. And thus it was pronounced and articulated so eloquently in those great, lofty and momentous words:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/afrakh-mutafalsifah.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Or how can the shoots (sprouts) of the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (referring to the Mutakallimin), and the followers of the Hindus and Greeks, the inheritors of the Magians, the Pagans, the misguided of the Jews and Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, and their likes and similar be more knowledgeable of Allaah than the inheritors of the Prophets, the people of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Eemaan?</blockquote>    <P>
So when you see Christian theology (of those who were affected by Classical Greek Theism) having this resemblance in language to the theology of the Mutakallimin (who took the proof of huduth al-ajsaam from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers, who themselves were the sprouts and shoots of the Greek philosophers) - then <u>you should finally awake</u> O <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> who has been deceived and hoodwinked - from your slumber and <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a>.    <P>
Later in the article we have:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/monopolar-theism-paper-f.gif border=0>    <P>
Here we have the foundation of one of the usool of the Mutakallimin which is their rejection of what they call "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) for Allaah, and by which they mean Allah's chosen actions. To those star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers upon their abstract ideas of what is perfect, divine, immutable, transcendent, Allaah making <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> <u>after</u> creating the creation is a defect. To them, Allaah ordering the Angels to prostrate to Adam <u>after</u> creating him is a defect. To them, that Allaah spoke to Moses direct <u>after</u> having not spoken to Him is a defect. To them, Allaah having taken Ibrahim as a friend <u>after</u> the non-existence of the creation and of Ibrahim is a defect. To them, Allaah's displeasure with a disbeliever, <u>after</u> being pleased with Him as a believer, and likewise, <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> with a believer <u>after</u> His displeasure with him as a disbeliever is a defect. All these are ideas "<i>which belong to the supposed defective side of the polar disjunction are summarily ruled out as having no place in a true definition of theism</i>" - meaning, they have no place in the theism of the Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers who corrupted the deen of the Mutakallimin, and likewise in the deen of the Mutakallimin themselves.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><u><b>An important clarification</b></u> needs to be made here regarding the <b><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></b>, who said that Allaah can acquire attributes after not having them, even though He had the capability over them previously. So they permit that Allaah can acquire speech, and hearing and seeing when He wishes and that events (hawaadith) are permissible in the essence of Allaah. Now this is a type of change which is rejected and which implies imperfection, and this opposes the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah that <u>Allaah has never ceased having all of His attributes</u>. However, they affirm the truth that is in the Book and the Sunnah that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power - and it is this firmly established truth and reality that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah are trying to deny upon the foundations and principles of their proof of huduth al-ajsaam whose roots lie in the Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers.</div>    <P>
So this is the foundation of the rejection of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazila, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will, that He did not  make istwaa over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, rather <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> is isteelaa (conquered) or it is an act He creates in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, not an act established with His self. And Allaah's speech is not His speech, He either does not have speech [Jahmiyyah] or it is created speech in others which is said to be His speech metaphorically [Mu'tazilah], or it is just <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> an "immutable, eternal, singular, indivisible" meaning in the self [Ash'ariyyah, Maturidiyyah]. And as for the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our presence it is makhluq, <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>, maj'ul, maf'ul (created, originated, manufactured, made). And Allaah does not become angry or pleased, rather this just means His intent to punish or reward, in eternity. <u>So you get the idea</u> ... and from this you understand the origins of the <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which is really tahrif (distortion) and this is what Bishr al-Mareesee al-Hanafi al-Jahmee compiled together, and this was what Abu Mansur al-Matureedee was harvesting over there beyond the river, spuriously calling it the Tawil of Ahl al-Sunnah. And all of this was to deal with those problematic texts that clashed with the Greek-Sabean derived kalam theology that they made the foundation of their deen.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This much is enough for the sincere seeker of truth, so we invite all <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in all corners of the globe. Let go of that tiresome, worn-out, pretentious theology you are holding on to and  do not let the fact that there were Scholars who got caught up in it in the centuries gone by deceive you, because once the fact of history is known and the hujjah is established, there is no excuse for remaining upon that baatil. Repent to Allaah, abandon this theology, abandon this heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and hybridized <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> that you are upon today, return to the Book and the Sunnah, return to the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, return to the creed of the Salaf of the first three generations which is <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation of meanings indicated by the texts) with the true tanzih which is negation of likeness (tamthil) and resemblance (tashbih) and denial of knowing how (kayf) and abandoning tahrif (disguised as ta'wil).</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion and Summary</font>    <P>
There is a crucial point in this article which may be missed by readers and hence it is important to note that one should not be deceived by the historical conflict between the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (<a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>) and the Mutakallimin (<a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>). For sure debate raged on whether the universe is eternal or not, about resurrection, about revelation and about prophethood - <u>but let that not blind you from the fact that they are all pretty much united in how they speak about Allaah</u>, because that speech, that theism, is necessitated and required of them by the underlying language and terminology they are all agreed upon. And for this reason you see both the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Mutakallimin <u>converging on certain matters</u> and considering them to be the absoluate truth, such as reason precedes and is decisive over revelation (al-Razi's "Universal Principle") and that the truth regarding Allaah is what lies in the language of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Mutakallimin that Allaah is not a body, not a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, not an incidental attribute, not in direction, not in place, not in spatial occupation, not above, not below, not within, not without... and NOT in the language of the revealed Books and sent Messengers who came with nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> so as not to scare off those dumb commoners from faith (see <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a> from <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>also here</a> from <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>also here</a> from Ibn Sina) - and there are numerous other matters too.  <P>
