<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
We were requested recently to comment on statement of creed issued by a person named <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> of Birmingham, who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> / Maturidi in creed (the word "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" is an umbrella term that includes the Maturidis, that's how most Maturidis themselves see it). A scan of a statement of creed written by this individual was sent to us on 5th April 2011. <u>We have  no idea when it was written</u>, but we commenced responding to it on 14th April 2011. In the commentary upon this statement, we will come to realize how today's Ash'aris do not really differentiate between the early Kullabi Ash'aris (who were much closer to Ahl al-Sunnah) and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who reverted to many of the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and left the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. At the same time, these contemporaries deceive themselves into thinking that what they are upon is the way of the Salaf, when the reality is that they are not even upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his early students (the Kullaabi Ash'aris), let alone the way of the Salaf. Further, when they present their creed, it is presented in a deceptive manner using generalizations and vagueness, and the avoidance of any specificity and detail so as to allow a false ascription to the Salaf to be made in front of the audience.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The reader is advised to get a good solid grasp on the reality behind the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis and this can be done by studying the following two sets of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
Whilst there are lots of other articles on this site that are also important and beneficial, these two sets of articles will give you the best comprehension of the entire subject matter and give you an good overview of the deen of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and their various offshoots. With this background information, you will better comprehend this series of articles.     <P>
<b><u>Note:</u> It is not our intent to bring extensive quotations and discuss particular issues in detail, because all of the background knowledge and detailed discussions have already been covered in other articles. Equipped with that knowledge, it becomes very easy to identify Tajahhum and its practitioners and see their errors, mistakes and deceptions in their speech and writings. So all we will be doing in these articles is to make pointers.</b>   </div>    <P>
Before we start commenting on his statement, we should clarify that <b>all of those we have addressed previously on this site</b> have been proven to be dishonest, conniving, calculated people, whose lies are plain and manifest to see to anyone with even an ounce of sincerity and the desire for seeking truth.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These are people like Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
So Allaah knows best about <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> how he will behave after the hujjah is established upon him that his orientation in creed (coming from the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi schools) is founded originally upon a matter that the Salaf condemned and vilified, namely the blameworthy <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> which he is trying so desperately to hide. What we find in practice is that as it becomes increasingly clear that the later As'haris had little to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and lost connection with him and that the Maturidis, from the very outset, were closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in creed than they were to the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, <u>these people became more shrewd and more adept</u> in the way they formulate and present their creed to the masses so as to conceal many things (by ommission) and to give the false picture that they are following the Salaf by maintaining policy of speaking in generalizations devoid of tafseelaat (details).     <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...A [person] asked me to clarify my aqidah in the topic of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, so I say - and with Allaah, the Exalted, lies  success -:    <P>
Indeed, my aqidah in the topic of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is that which the majority of the Righteous Salaf, those for whom goodness has been testified, as occurs in the hadeeth, "<i>The best of generations is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them</i>." Indeed, the madhhab (way) of the Righteous Salaf is most knowledgeable, most precise, and most safe, being established upon the Book and the Sunnah, and it is that which the best of the Ummah and the most senior of the Scholars traversed upon.</blockquote>    <P>
We have a number of points here:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> His ascription to the Salaf and their aqidah is upon his mistaken notion that what the Salaf were upon is what the Ash'aris [those who label themselves as Ash'aris today] and Maturidis are upon today. This is <b>a demonstrably false notion</b>, it is not possible to reconcile between these two because one is based upon the pure and untainted stream and fountain of revelation and the other is based upon the refuse of the previous Hellenized nations from the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who had founded their theology upon the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> which then came to the Mutakallimeen of Islaam, from which are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidee <a href='tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. This was what the Salaf were very severe against, and this is the very <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they condemnded and declared its practitioner a deviant, heretic, straying wanderer. Do not be deceived by the tricks these people play today by fooling around with the definition of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" and when they try to convince you that the Salaf practiced "kalaam." <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is a generic word, and the Salaf did not condemn the genus of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (as in speech in theological matters), but they condemned <u>the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</u> and which is the foundation of the deen of the Mutakallimeen, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah - all of them, both <u>the Mu'attilah</u> amongst them and <u>the Mujassimah</u> amongst them.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> He affirms that the way of the Salaf is the truth, that it is <i>a'lam</i> (most knowledgeable), <i>ahkam</i> (most precise) and <i>aslam</i> (most safe). However as we shall see, this  will become nothing more than an attempt to impress upon the readership that <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> respects and venerates the way of the Salaf in aqidah, when in practice and reality, he is an opposer to it. These Ash'aris and Maturidis have realized that to say what their predecessors in the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> they borrowed from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> say, <b>that what they are upon is a'lam (more erudite) and ahkam (more precise), but what the Salaf were upon is aslam (more safe)</b>, that this gives the game away to a lot of people. For this reason, they have abandoned this speech of their predecessors in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and have become more adept in concealing the reality of what their speech about Allaah is founded upon. This is why we see this grand opening by <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> at the beginning by which one is led to believe that he venerates and respects the Salaf and follows them to the letter and word and gives the pretence that the considers their way to be <i>a'lam, ahkam and aslam</i>. However, as we shall see, what follows at the end of his written statement leads to nothing but an anti-climax and delivers nothing of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> by which one can rightfully say "<i>Indeed the opening of Asrar Rashid's statement is backed up the closing of Asrar Rashid's statement</i>," rather one will conclude that the last of which Asrar wrote in his creed above <b>falsifies everything that came before it</b> and proves that his attachment to the Salafi aqidah is in name only and is mere decoration for the followers who can't see beyond the glitter.    <P>
<b>Third:</b> The way of the Salaf is <u>tafseel (detail)</u> when it comes to mentioning and presenting their creed, and one would have thought that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> would have practically followed in their footsteps alongside this glittering introduction that appears to venerate and respect the Salaf and highlight the excellence and correctness of their way. Instead, as we shall see in what follows, Asrar has filled his entire page with generalizations which appear to be in agreement with the way of the Salaf in wording, but the reality of what <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> intends by these statements and the truthfulness of his claim can only be verified when he proceeds to mention his creed in detail, something he has quite clearly avoided and for no vain reason either. <b>Of the approximately 80 or so books that we could list written by the Salaf from the mid second century until the early fourth century (from 150H to 320H)</b> on the issues of creed in which they opposed the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, we find that whilst they (the Salaf) outline generalized principles that summarize their creed, <u>they give specific details on specific issues</u> that pertain to the Attributes of Allaah, <b>such that there would no confusion left in the mind of anybody who reads their statements</b> about the difference between what they were upon of <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> without tahreef and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and what the blameworthy <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were upon of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> through tahreef (called ta'weel) and against whom all of these books were authored by the Salaf. People like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> probably recognize this reality (as in, mentioning specifics will quickly expose you and your creed as being in conflict witht that of the Salaf). If they were to start writing down exactly what attributes they affirm as attributes of the essence (dhaat) and what attributes they do not, then the wider audience would quickly identify that this is characteristic of a creed founded upon <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and not based upon the way and methodology of the Salaf even if it is decorated with the generalizations and the broad principles of the Salaf like those <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> has mentioned in his statement above, <b>but which he explicitly opposes as soon as he delves into mentioning or hinting at his creed on the subject of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and al-uluww</b> and revealing that he is a follower of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> (who followed the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> for Allaah and His <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah) and not a follower of the Salaf and nor of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> or <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> or the very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> - and we have extensively documented their position on <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah in numerous articles on this site, so please refer to them, and we also explained the reality of the creed of the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, who were the staunchest of people against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah.  </blockquote>    <P>
We shall look at his next statement in Part 2 inshaa'Allaah. <P>
