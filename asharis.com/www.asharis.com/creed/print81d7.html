<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Regular readers of <a href=../index.html>Asharis.Com</a> will be familiar with the <u>academic fraudster</u> known as Abu Adam al-Naruiji. We have exposed him and caught him red-handed a number of times committing academic fraud and a notable example of that can be found in a series of articles that can be accessed <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>through this summarization</a> of what transpired regarding his claim that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> believes Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>. Through this new series of articles our aim is to offer sincere advice to <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> and Maturidis alike and to warn them about the academic fraudsters in their midst who are far-removed from honesty, integrity and trustworthiness. There is nothing wrong with rebuttals and refutations, but academic and intellectual fraud does no good to anyone's cause (be they upon truth or falsehood). This creates an unnecessary level of confusion and which spoils that atmosphere in which sincere people are seeking to know the truth and where honest truthful discussion takes place without misrepresentation. The previous instance of fraud from al-Naruiji was illustrated in <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>his claim</a> that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> believes Allah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> into parts. When we caught him misquoting <u>red-handed</u> he was forced to acknowledge it, but then (out of childish resentment) he persisted upon his way in trying to malign <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> for something he is free of and in a matter in which al-Naruiji was out of his depth and could not even fathom, as was clear illustrated in those series of articles. It turned out that he was dishonestly employing the argument of <u>the Philosophers</u> against those who affirm attributes (accusing them of declaring Allaah to be composite) through the argument of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) and using it against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> - which is hypocritical because on the one hand you refute the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> for using this argument of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) against you (the Ash'aris) but at the same time you consider it permissible to use the same argument against Ahl al-Sunnah. In any case, when we quoted <u>Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Sanusi</u> (d. 895H), an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, from his book "Sharh al-Kubraa" (<a href=index9dd0.html?dhptx>see here</a>) <b>effectively siding with Ibn Taymiyyah</b> (against <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> who brought this doubt) al-Naruiji <u>was exposed for the vermin he actually is</u> and was promptly sent hurtling into the stratosphere, along with his fraud.    <P>
As of recent, al-Naruiji has published an alleged comparison survey of the view of the Mutakallimun, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, and his intent is to make it appear as if <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is in agreement with the doctrines of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. As expected and not unusually, he continues in his tradition of academic fraud.  So our aim is to expose his academic fraud, and to warn the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> from relying upon such people in their polemics against the Salafis, because they are only subjecting themselves to delusion and further sin. These types of people (Naruiji, GF Haddaad) are known for academic dishonesty, and while many <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> have recognized this about GF Haddaad, people like <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> are still on the field because they are good at pretending scholarship in theological matters, and also because most Ash'aris are generally clueless about history and about the origins of their theology, and we have found them to be most ignorant of people of the very kalam which is a hallmark of their theological school.    <P>
Also as a general remark, one should note that the theology of the Mutakallimun <u>cannot</u> stand on its own merits and as <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo >see here</a>) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz >see here</a>), both said explicitly that the language of the Mutakallimun is such that <u>it would lead the majority to Atheism</u>, that is straight from their books, verbatim, and they were preceded in that by <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>) whose books they had both been reading. Because of that, the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> and Maturidis have a tact of first demonizing a figure (<a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) and presenting a horrid picture, and when the audience has been give doses of this intellectual terrorism, the language of the Mutakallimin in describing Allaah becomes more palatable and accetable and less averse to the fitrah. This is a calculated tactical strategy these people use and hence a large part of their efforts is to pick out notable figures from Ahl al-Sunnah and then perform ad hominem attacks and make slurs, and this is part of legitimizing their own creed, not by its own inherent merits, but by a type of intellectual terrorism.    <P>

<img src=assets/images/ibnt-philosophers-comp.gif border=1 align=right hspace=10 vspace=8 border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Academic Fraudster, al-Naruiji's Survey</font>    <P>
Let us first introduce the results of al-Naruiji's academic fraud (see diagram on right) which are founded upon a falsification  of history and misrepresentation of the nature and details of the arguments between the various factions (Philosophers, Mutakallimun, Ahl al-Sunnah), and then we will give some background history and context and after this we will proceed, one by one, to demolish each of al-Naruiji's frauds, by Allaah's permission. It looks impressive and well-organized, but academic fraud and lies make even the most well appearing of things disfigured and reprehensible.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Important Background Information</font>    <P>
In reality, there is an abundance of information on this site already which deals extensively with the history and background of the evolution of the theology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. And in all the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> polemics today against Ahl al-Sunnah, their protagonists hide this history from their audience because history gives context, and context allows true evaluation and gives insight, and this insight is that last thing which todays <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi scholarship wants the flock to acquire. So in what follows we are going to give <u>historical facts</u>. Full and proper documentation is outside the scope of this article otherwise it would become too lengthy, so the intent here is to provide a historical framework, the evidence of which is already established in many other articles, and which can be used by the reader to follow up with their own study in order to verify that what we are presenting is indeed, the truth, no more, no less.      <P>
We strongly advise the reader to be familiar with the contents of the following two series of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
So here goes, and we will try to keep as brief as possible:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The Ancient Greek Philosophers</b>. The prominent ancient <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> prior to the time of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (d. 322BC) affirmed the creation of the heavens and the earth and affirmed attributes for Allaah, the Exalted, and they were closer to what is in the revealed Books and what was said by the sent Messengers. The saying of the eternity of matter was propagated and popularized by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and  <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> was a major figure whose logic and philosophy was very influential in his time and for many centuries after him. His ideas were instrumental in leading many a nation (who had received revelation) away from the teachings of the Books and Messengers to misguidance in matters pertaining to belief in Allaah and in belief in Monotheism. Jews, Christians, <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> were all influenced by <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> in their theology.    <P>
<b>Aristotle and Darwin</b>. You might think how has Aristotle's name been put alongside Darwin's. Well it is to help you understand the mighty influence of the philosophy and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and how it entered <u>the theology</u> of other nations (<u>Jews</u>, <u>Christians</u>, <u><a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a></u> and <u>Muslims</u>). If you look at Darwin, he changed the nature of science in that his theory was so influential and considered the only explanation for life and existence that all science from his time onwards was made to operate upon the premise that natural selection explains all life and is the ultimate truth. Therefore, this underlying assumption determined the nature of all scientific enquiry and scientific enquiry was made to conform to this idea and had to be interpreted in light of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Because of the widespread acceptance of this theory, even religious factions began to evaluate their beliefs (and their religious texts) in order to accommodate this view. This was how Aristotle's logic and philosophy was considered in that time, and continued to do so for many long centuries after, right into the second millenium CE.    <P>
<b>Aristotle's Syllogistic Logic and Metaphysics</b>.  <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> spoke a lot about the issue of language and predication (ascribing a quality to something), and this was primarily a linguistic discussion. However, this discussion was fundamental to laying down his philosophy and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. It was integrally tied to his syllogistic logic, that by which the <u>truthfulness of propositions</u> can be evaluated. A proposition is simply to say "A is B", such as "the tea is hot." You have probably heard of this before, its like this:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>All A's are B's<BR>  X is an A<BR>  Therefore X is a B</blockquote></div>    <P>
So since the truth and falsehood of propositions was integral to attaining knowledge to <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the issue of predication in the language, as in assigning qualities and  properties to things, was discussed in detail by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> to lay the foundations for his philosophy and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. As part of this, he laid down what are known as his Ten Categories, also known as <b>al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b> (substance and incidental attribute or body and accident) and <b>al-Maqulat al-Ashar</b> (the ten categories). The intent of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> here was to <u>comprehensively categorize</u> everything in the observable universe that can take the place of a <u>subject</u> and a <u>predicate</u> in a proposition. In the proposition "<i>the tea is hot</i>", the "<i>tea</i>" is the subject and "<i>is hot</i>" is the predicate. So he came up with ten categories and everything in the universe is either a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (jawhar, jism) or nine incidental attributes, and incidental attributes are found only in substances. All of this <u>created the framework</u> upon which his logic and philosophy could be built. These ten categories are presented below:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The first category deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (a'raad, also referred to as "accidents") which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol></div>    <P>
Once we understand this, then many a nation incorporated the logic, conceptual tools and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> within their theology and this would be parallel to how we find today, Jews, Christians and some Muslims admitting to the truthfulness of Darwin's evolutionary theory and trying to merge it with their revealed texts. We have proven in a series of articles that this is what happened with the Jews, Christiand and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> before this influence came into the Muslims, and we established that this is the <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> in which those Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> had already preceded the Mutakallimun of Islam by many centuries. We emphatically suggest you read our <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>five-article series</a> on this subject - it is a long read, but extremely rewarding.    <P>
<b>The God of Aristotle</b>. Aristotle's God is referred to as "<u>the first cause</u>" or "<u>the unmoved mover</u>" and while a full treatment of his theology and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> is outside the scope of this article we can say in short that he argued on the basis of what he saw as the perpetual motion of the celestial bodies (their orbits) that the universe and its matter is therefore eternal and perpetual. However, in order to avoid an <u>infinite regress (endless chain)</u> of agents and causes, this motion must itself have been brought about by an unmoved mover, and this is the "first cause" and "unmoved mover." This is identified as Aristotle's God. Then <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> explains that this unmoved mover is abstract, immutable, static, immaterial, outside of space and time and without attribute or action, and that the way He moves the universe is similar to the way that the one who is passionately loved moves the one who passionately loves, without any action on behalf of the passionately loved. The universe is moved by this "first cause" and "unmoved mover" without any will, speech, or action, because this "first cause" is purely abstract, immaterial, outside of space and time, devoid of action, immutable. Thus the universe is simply drawn to motion and such is the relationship between God and the universe, and God is said to permanently act, without action being established with His self. To <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, this God is denied all of the ten categories (see what has preceded above, meaning Allaah is not a body, nor an <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, nor in a place, nor has any actions etc.) and is outside of space and time and is indivisible. You can see here <u>the type of language</u> being used to characterize this type of God (and this is what later became the God of the Mutakallimin when this influence and language crept into their theology and started permeating their conceptions about belief in Allaah). It is crucial at this stage that you make note of what <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> uses as proof for what makes something to be a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), <u>it is the issue of motion (<i>harakah</i>)</u>, and this concept itself was later used by the Mutakallimeen, as proof to indicate that something is a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (substance, body) on account of it being subject to both motion (harakah) and rest (sukoon) and this is what <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a> (d. 406H) - [who is the most instrumental figure in making the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> creed what it is today] - uses in his book al-Tamheed. The point here is that even though <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> spoke of the eternity of the universe, he also affirmed what he called a "first cause" the God of the universe, and his belief in that God was determined and characterized by his conceptual language (negation of <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> and all the <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, incidental attributes, said of bodies), and this conceptual language is what entered into those who fell into "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" from the Hellenized Jews, Christians, <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (and later Muslims). <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> and Maturidis will protest that they only used the tools and concepts of those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to rebut them and were not affected by it in their theology and this is one of the greatest lies and frauds in history, as the sincere person will realize after a read of <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>these five articles</a>.    <P>
<b>The Theological Language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (and of the Ahl al-Kalaam)</b>. You can find this in Aristotle's <i><u>Metaphysics 12</u></i> treatise, and here are some excerpts from it, "<i>The unmoved mover is infinite, since it causes infinite motion. It follows that it is also without magnitude, since an infinite force cannot reside in a finite magnitude (and there can be no infinite magnitudes); having no magnitude means that the first mover is indivisible, having no parts</i>", (now you know where the Mutakallimin get their statements such as "God does not occupy space, God does not have spatial extension" and so on). This unmoved mover is, "<i>eternal, unmovable and separate from sensible things</i>" (meaning cannot be perceived with the senses, and this is what <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought into the Ummah), and he also says, "<i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence. The reason that God can have no magnitude is that God produces motion through infinite time, which means that God must be infinite, since an infinite effect requires an infinite cause; but there cannot be such a thing as an infinitude magnitude. As being a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> without magnitude, God is without parts and, therefore, indivisible (magnitudes are divisible)</i>", and here in the next statement we see the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, where we read "<i>the primary essence has no matter, which means that there can only be one God, since it is matter that differentiates one form or definition into many manifestations of that one form or definition.  Since God has no matter, then God is one not only formally or in definition, but also numerically</i>" and here is something else which is a parallel to the theology of the Mutakallimin, straight from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, "<i>It has been shown also that this primary essence cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible. But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of place</i>." This last statement alludes to what the Mutakallimin are upon of denying what they call hawaadith for Allaah, the denial of those matters tied to Allaah's will and choice which they call "events" and "changes" but which to Ahl al-Sunnah are Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>). The <u>intelligent and shrewd reader</u> will by now have seen the intellectual and academic fraud of not just Abu Adam al-Naruiji, but of all other dishonest <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who conceal historical fact from those whom they misguide. And it is for no reason that they use this very deceptive tactic of throwing <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> along with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, because they want to create smoke and mirrors and place barriers between their flock and the realization of the true and real origins of their theological language. As for arguing with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> about the universe being eternal and about resurrection, that became a battle and a major matter of contention when people like <u><a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a></u> (d. 429H) came along and they saw these Mutakallimun already using the language and conceptual tools and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in trying to prove the universe is originated, and when they saw this was a corrupt proof with inherent flaws which actually proves the exact opposite of what the Mutakallimin intended by it, they began to employ the criticism of the flaw as evidence for their claim of the universe being eternal, even though they did not have any evidence at all to begin with. It is here that <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> entered with his activity and worked to corrupt and invalidate the (already flawed) arguments of the Mutakallimeen. But putting that to one side, <b>all of them, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Mutakallimun are united upon the type and nature of the theological language they use to describe Allaah the Exalted</b>, even if they argued and debated on other matters, this is because they all submitted to and accepted the soundness of the conceptual tools and terminology which were made the platform of debate. So do not let academic fraudsters, shysters and swindlers make a fool of you dear reader, if you are someone who has any dignity or self-respect for his mind and intellect.     <P>
<b>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</b>. When other nations incorporated that great science of the day (i.e. Aristotle's logic and philosophy and conceptual terminology) - even if they rejected his claim of the eternity of matter - their <u>theological language</u> began to resemble that of Aristotle's and again, you would do real well to read  <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>through our five-article series</a> that deals with the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who were already upon <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> before the Mutakallimeen of Islam even saw the light of day by hundreds of years. As an illustration we see Jewish rabbis and Christian priests and monks and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> all incorporating that conceptual baggage into their theological language. In that <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>five-article series</a> we have alluded to, we speak of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> (20BC-50CE), a Jew from Alexandria who was present around the time <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (alayhis salaam), and the second is <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo (d. 430CE), a Christian, and thirdly, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a>, who were Hellenized <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, present when Islam came.     <P>
<b>The <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and the Kalam Cosmological Argument (Huduth al-Ajsaam)</b>. There were from the Sabean star-worshippers those who still maintained belief in the creation of the heavens of the earth, that they were originated. They had a proof which is actually the precursor to the kalam cosmological argument, and it states (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>refer to this article</a>):    <P>

As a result of this proof, it was from the hallmark of the theological language of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> that they described Allaah with pure negatives (sifaat salbiyyah) <u>in order to avoid affirming any affirmative attribute for Him</u> which would of course <u>invalidate their proof</u>, and they claimed that this proof and what follows on from it made them true monotheists. Hence, they would say, "He is not unjust, He is not blind, He is not non-existent, He is not incapable..." and so on, these are negative assertions by which they avoided establishing any affirmative attributes which would invalidate their proof for His existence. <b>It is this proof that came into the Muslim Ummah through al-Ja'd bin Dirham, then to al-Jahm and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and through them, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and then through them the Ash'aris and Maturidis, however it received some refinements along the way</b>.

This was entered into the Ummah by two men, one of whom was a student of the other. This was al-Ja'd bin Dirham and al-Jahm bin Safwaan, and they brought this into the Ummah, and al-Ja'd used to mix with the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of Harraan and also with the Hellenized Jews and Christians in Damascus, and it is reported about them, through tawaatur (large-scale transmission) that they <u>denied</u> <b>a)</b> Allaah has any attributes, <b>b)</b> Allaah has any actions, <b>c)</b> Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, <b>d)</b> Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter with the vision of the eyes, <b>e)</b> Allaah spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or spoke to Moses, or has speech, <b>f)</b> Allaah took Ibrahim as His khalil (friend).

Al-Jahm bin Safwaan spread this into the Ummah and he was the first to say "<i>Allaah is not a jism</i>" and innovated negation (<a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>) not known to the Prophets and Messengers and not revealed in any Book and not stated by any of the Companions and Taabi'een. <b>It was in fact stated by Aristotle!</b> When this "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (which is really philosophy) entered the Ummah, all of the leading Imaams condemned it and declared its practitioners as heretics.

The intent here is to show that this mental spastic is simply pretending to have knowledge, when he is nothing short of an ignorant and confused academic fraudster, and whilst pretending to be an enemy of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, he is in fact borrowing the proof outlined by <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> of <i>takhsis</i> (specification) in order to vilify Ahl al-Sunnah, without realizing that by using this proof of <i>takhsis</i>, he is bound and forced to deny all attributes for Allaah, since if Allaah made specification (takhsis) of man as hearing, seeing, knowing, willing, speaking - and these are signs of "specification" indicating creation and specification of form and of attribute - and Allaah too is hearing, seeing, knowing, willing and speaking, then who made <i>takhsis</i> for Allaah? - and this was Ibn Sina's intent - but as we said in an earlier article about al-Naruiji, his example is like that of a dog who lolls out its tongue. Leave it or beat it, it still lolls out its tongue.    <P>
<b>Enter the Mutafalsifah</b>. There were from those who ascribed to Islam such as <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) who were upon the philosophy of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and they tried to merge those beliefs (of the eternity of the universe) with the revealed texts. What led them to this was when they saw the Mutakallimun using the proof of huduth al-ajsaam upon the conceptual tools and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> (the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad)  they saw their opportunity to argue for the eternity of the universe. Now neither <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> nor <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> nor any atheist till this day of ours has any proof or evidence that the universe is eternal, it is merely presumption, with no rational or scientific proof except mere conjecture and fancy. But when they saw that the  proof of huduth al-ajsaam was inherently flawed, they thought that by pointing out this flaw, they could argue for their position that the universe is eternal. Now again, the discussion of the intricate details of this argument is outside the scope of this article, as our aim here is merely to provide a historical framework by which we can out <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> as an intellectual fraudster, and a crippled one at that. So we will leave that discussion for another place.     <P>
<b>Assaulting the Revealed Texts With Aristotelian Metaphysics</b>. We now see that the Mutakallimun of Islam simply used the rotten leftovers of previous Hellenized nations (the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, all of whom had strong influence from Aristotles <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> in their theology) which they labelled "<a href="tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>" and then thought they could defend Islam by way of it. They used this argument of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>, and treated it to be something which Islam's truthfulness depends upon, they were forced to abide by its binding necessities, in order not to invalidate it, and this was the birth and foundation of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (divestment) in the Ummah whose Imaams were al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (and later Bishr al-Mareesee al-Jahmee). From here the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> schools differed with each other and their differences arose because they all tried to find their own ways to remain truthful to the core premises of this proof (huduth al-ajsaam), so some of them followed the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and denied all of <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> (<a href='tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a>) and attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) and said He is "<i>He is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</i>" (in order to keep the proof intact) and others only denied attributes and actions, and others denied some attributes and all actions, and others said "<i>He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), but not like the created bodies</i>" - all of these debates and discussion were <u>an inter-kalaam thing</u> and the Salaf never knew anything of it, they were free and innocent of this falsehood, because they drank <u>the pure wholesome milk of revelation</u> and were far far removed from the dung, puss and blood of previous nations. We very strongly suggest you take some time out to read <a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>our series of articles</a> on the slander of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a>) against Ahl al-Sunnah, as this will give you further insight. This is also where the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> was born, it was a means by which they tried to deal with those verses that clashed with their proof (of huduth al-ajsaam), and so all of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> took certain approaches towards those revealed texts (mentioning the attributes and actions of Allaah) and most of the false ta'weels were invented in the second-century, and by the Imaam of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, Bishr al-Mareesee al-Hanafi al-Jahmi (d. 218H), and these ta'weels later found their way into the books of the Ash'aris.    <P>
<b>Between the Mutakallimun and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in Theological Language</b>.

What we are seeing in the above is both <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> outlining a similar point which is that what is to them the true theological language (their <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> based terminologies in describing Allaah) is something that most people would be averse to - and which amounts to nothing but pure <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> to most people - and the point they are both making is that  people should not be called to belief through these terminologies directly, but in an indirect way so as to avoid them falling into <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> and denial. However, what <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> is leading towards in his discussion (as we read further on) is that he says that just like you (the Mutakallimun) and us (the Philosophers) are <u>all agreed</u> that Allaah can't be described with such attributes on the basis of verses which to all of us (Mutakallimun and Philosophers) constitute <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a>), and thus we have to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> ((metaphorical interpretation) of them, then likewise, we, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, have even more justification of making <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of those verses which deal with creation and resurrection (to support our belief that the universe is eternal and there is no bodily resurrection) because if <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the verses that relate to the most fundamental pillar, which is belief in Allaah, is acceptable to us and you (Philosophers and Mutakallimun) then <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of those verses which are less than that (creation and resurrection) are even more warranted and even more acceptable. <b>And to this, the Mutakallimun don't have any answer at all</b>. Finally, we will leave you in further wonderment by citing here the words of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) too, who agrees with <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and al-Ghazali(!!). He said in his tafseer book <i>Mafateeh al-Ghayb</i> (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>see full documentation here</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><u>The fifth angle:</u> And this is the strongest reason in this topic - that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a book that comprises the call to the people of distinction (al-khawaass) and the common people (al-awaam) [in their] totality. The natural dispositions of the common people are averse, for the most part, to comprehending the realities. Thus, when one from the common folk hears at the beginning the affirmation of an existent (mawjood) that: "<i>is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>", and "<i>is not occupying space</i>" and "<i>cannot be pointed to</i>", he will think this is non-existence and negation and he will fall into <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (i.e. negation of such a one described). Thus, it is more suitable that they are addressed with words that indicate some of what is appropriate to what they presume and imagine, and that such (language) should be mixed with what indicates the clear truth.</blockquote>    <P>
From all the above, what we read is basically the following (from the Mutakallimin), "<i>The common people are too dumb to grasp the realities of belief as characterized through <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> (the great science and philosophy of the time) and if they were to be presented belief in Allaah through such language, they would all turn to <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> and disbelief. Hence, it is better not to approach them directly with this type of language (not because it is false or untrue) but in the better interests of the faith of the dumb commoners. And whilst we differ with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> on matters such as the eternity of the universe and bodily resurrection, the language of truth in describing how Allaah really lies in their conceptual language, that is the true language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and as for what the Books and Messengers brought, that is nothing but presumptions of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> which was necessary to keep the dumb commoners within the boundaries of faith, and it was left to us, the Mutakallimun to slowly introduce the true and real language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in a careful, tactical manner to those dumb commoners</i>." And this became their evil perception of the  revealed texts, and from Allaah is the refuge! And this is exactly what <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>) and Ibn-Sina (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>see  here</a>) are all saying - and this is essentially the view of all of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Ash'aris and Maturidis included) towards the revealed texts of the attributes, because they are operating upon the premise of conflict between reason (aql) and revelation (naql), and their Imaam's like <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, laid down the mother of foundations for them, called <i>al-Qaanoon al-Kulli</i> (the Universal Principle) in his book Asaas al-Taqdis, which essentially states that when there is conflict between reason and revelation, reason should prevail, and the revealed texts should be subservient to reason.    <P>
<b>The Door Opened for the Zanaadiqah and Malaahidah</b>. Hence, far from aiding Islam, the Mutakallimun simply opened up an evil door which allowed the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and others to assault the revealed texts and to fool and play with the revealed texts. To see a perfect illustration of that read <a href=index29c0.html?uzpnh>this article</a> to see how the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> gave the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <b>a mighty pounding</b> because of the latter using flawed corrupt arguments (based on Aristotelian Metaphysics) in relation to the <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> of Allah, the Exalted (being above His creation). These types of battles then continued for centuries, until by the time <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) and <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a> (d. 631H) had had their turn, kalam and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> had somewhat merged (this is the subject of another article). Further,  when the <u>Mutakallimin</u> said "<i>hand means power</i>" and "<i>istiwaa means conquering</i>" and "<i>face means reward</i>", and "<i>uluww and fawq means one of rank and status, not of essence</i>" the <u><a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a></u> said, "<i>Thank you! We will do the same with the texts pertaining to the creation and resurrection, so Allaah being "the first" means one of rank and status not one of the essence (hence the texts don't disprove the universe is eternal)</i>," and then the <u>Baatiniyyah</u> came along and said, "<i>Thank you! And we will do the same with the texts of the <u>ahkaam</u> and <u>sharaa'i</u>, so the prayers are merely symbols for the names of our leaders and fasting simply means to keep our secrets and Hajj means to visit our shaykhs</i>..." and all of this was on account of the "<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>" and "<i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>" that the Mutakallimun entered into Islam from other nations.    <P>

He refuted their errors just as he refuted the errors of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and showed their great dishonesty in argument and showed they were more astray. And he showed the correct way to refute the claim of the eternity of the Universe, by sticking to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and avoiding that false, corrupt language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. Because there arose so many factions of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, all disputing with each other (about the details and necessities of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam) and likewise because there were Scholars attached to Hadeeth and Sunnah who were influenced by something of it, or of its conclusions, he discusses in detail and at length, the views and positions of all the factions and likewise their arguments and counter-arguments against each other, and at times, when one reads his works, a person has to be on their toes and make sure they are following carefully, to ensure that one is constantly aware as to who is saying what and whose argument or view it is that is presently being discussed and whose necessities (in argument) are being highlighted and whose implications are being stated and discussed and so on. And when this is the case, intellectual cripples and mental spastics like al-Naruiji come along, coupled with their dishonesty and having an axe to grind, they take and quote whatever they want to a naive, ill-informed audience and hoodwink them into believing that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> believed this particular thing, or said this particular thing, when it is a complete fabrication and is nothing of the sort upon investigation. In turn they abandon and leave the clear statements where the belief is stated clearly and plainly, because here, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is not evaluating and discussing the views of the various factions but just stating what is the plain truth in the Book and the Sunnah and the sayings of the Salaf. Basically, the writings of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> are too sophisticated for dumb academic fraudsters like al-Naruiji to be reading and pretending to understand. </blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote>This is what we could quickly present with the constraints of time, and we may revise and add to this with whatever is appropriate, but we suggest you read and re-read this over a few times so you have a historical framework at least.  On a closing it is laughable, in fact, <u>hilarious</u>, that an academic fraudster who is caught red-handed lying upon <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, and is caught unable to distinguish between the arguments of the Philosphers and the Mutakallimin (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see this article here</a>) should put himself forward to do a "survey of comparison" of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - its like letting the fox count the sheep and make sure they are nicely tucked into bed.</blockquote> <P>
