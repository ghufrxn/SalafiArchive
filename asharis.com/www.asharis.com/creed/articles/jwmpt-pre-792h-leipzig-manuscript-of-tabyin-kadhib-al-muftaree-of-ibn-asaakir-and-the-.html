<img src=../assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is <b>the topping</b> for a series of articles in which we made live commentary on <u>the antics</u> of a group amongst the pseudo-Ash'ari neo-Jahmite swindlers who are perpetrating <u>the hoax</u> that they are actually followers of <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in their aqidah - and we can even be generous to them if we say and assume that Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> remained a Kullaabi proper - because even we are generous to them with this, these shysters <u>are still not following</u> the Kullaabi aqidah of Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. These people are very deceptive, use a lot of cunning, calculated deception and play tomfoolery with the minds and hearts of the ordinary <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> "wannabe", the sincere person who actually wants to follow Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari's actual creed. But unfortunately, these sincere people are being scammed and led into another direction.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Some Revision Of What Took Place Previously and Some Reminders</font>    <P>
Three individuals <a href='../tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, <a href='../tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a> and <a href='../tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a> were involved in a scam in trying to discredit the book al-Ibaanah with claims of tampering merely because there appears to be a variation between what is cited by Ibn Asaakir (d 571H) in his book <i>Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftaree</i> and todays printed versions. They had been fed with rotten leftovers by GF Haddaad who was the initiator of this hoax. In particular, they played upon the issue of the variation in the mention of eyes in the dual (aynaan) and the singular (ayn). We covered this in detail (see   <a href=../index7298.html?czfxq>here</a>, <a href=../indexb479.html?ohgey>here</a>, <a href=../index69b8.html?uqxke>here</a> and <a href=../indexbaa4.html?xoufz>here</a>) and exposed that charlatanry and showed that this is just a red-herring used to deceive.     <P>
Now there are a number of layers of deception involved here so you have to catch them all.     <P>
<blockquote><b><u>Firstly</u></b>, these pseudo-Ash'aris do not even affirm the attribute of eye(s) as an attribute of Allaah's essence to begin with, as the standard established <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> view today is these are not from Allaah's attributes since they imply limbs. In this view, today's pseudo-Ash'aris oppose all the early <a href='../tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> such as <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, Ibn Mahdee al-Tabari, al-Baqillaani and we can include <a href='../tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> who also affirmed the attribute of eye for Allaah, they affirmed these as actual attributes of the essence although they entered into a methodological departure from the way of the Salaf by making specific negations. However, they never delved into <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> nor tafweed in relation to these attributes. So the first thing is that <u>you are not even on our side of the fence</u> on this issue, where there are the Salaf, and those <a href='../tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> we just mentioned. You are on the other side of the fence, with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the animal fodder.    <P>
<u><b>Secondly</b></u>, the variation in the use of aynaan (two eyes) or ayn (eye) is <u>totally immaterial and utterly irrelevant</u>, especially when we see that in all the manuscripts of al-Ibaanah there is to be found an entire chapter dealing with these attributes in which <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> uses both the singular and dual of eye. Hence, trying to deceive the audience by the <u>apparent</u> variation between manuscripts as it relates to the opening passage of al-Ibaanah (whilst ignoring the actual chapter dealing with the attribute of eyes and hiding from the audience that all  manuscripts are identical) is in fact <u>a huge scam</u>. It is a confidence trick, because they simply have to discredit this book because it convicts them for the neo-Jahmites that they are, who have zero connection with Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, except for that misappropriation of his good name.</blockquote>    <P>
Now, if you read up on those earlier articles (<a href=../series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see series here</a>) you will realize that they were making comparisons between today's published versions of al-Ibaanah which rely upon around six or so manuscripts between them, and between a passage that Ibn Asaakir cited from his copy of al-Ibaanah from the beginning of al-Ibaanah. Now, it so happens that there are also numerous manuscripts of Ibn Asaakir's Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftaree, where this citation is made. <u><b>And in most of these manuscripts</b></u>, Ibn Asaakir actually quotes "<i>two eyes</i>". <u>Now this is very, very significant</u>. What this means is that the scam is bigger and deeper and more serious. Because if you were truly and really honest, you would have admitted and said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">Hey, there are numerous manuscripts of Ibn Asaakir's Tabyin in which "two eyes" are mentioned. In fact in most of those manuscripts "two eyes" are mentioned. And so from the angle of academic honesty, we can't really use this as an issue <u>to claim tampering</u> of the text of al-Ibaanah of <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. Rather, what appears to be most correct, when considering all of the evidence together, is that what is correct in al-Ibaanah in those places is the mention of two eyes. This appears to be the case in almost all manuscripts of al-Ibaanah and likewise, this appears the case in all manuscripts of <a href='../tags/al-tabyin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tabyin</font></a> as well (in which Ibn Asaakir was quoting from his copy of al-Ibaanah). Further, since we see that in <i>al-Maqaalaat</i> <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> also mentions "two eyes" and al-Baqillaani also affirms two eyes in his book al-Tamhid, and likewise we even see <u><a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='../tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u>, <u>al-Shahrastaanee</u> and <u>al-Baghdaadee</u> all confirming that the earliest Ash'aris affirmed two eyes, then we'll just resign from this scam and drop it alltogether. This scam is unlikely to work because overwhelmingly the evidence is against us.</font></blockquote>    <P>
So you get the idea of what is going on. But these fools decided not to drop it alltogether and opted to get caught out instead with unchanged nappies... (the evil outcome of consuming GF Haddaad's rotten leftovers).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Acknowledgement:</b> The scans below were sent to us by Moulay Abdoellah (may Allaah reward him) who took the effort to acquire them. There is also another manuscript dated 659H which, Allaah willing, should be made available through him. Information about the various manuscripts in this article is taken from material that Moulay Abdoellah sent to us.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Various Manuscripts of <a href="../tags/al-tabyin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Tabyin</font></a></font>    <P>
Those involved in publishing Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari - for which numerous manuscripts exist - such as Muhammad Zaahid al-Kawthari, and Ahmad Hijaazee al-Saqaa failed to point out those other manuscripts. And since one is going to publish such an important work, it is from scholarly standards that you actually do a decent job of it, which is to refer to all available manuscripts, and then strive to publish an edition which relies upon as many as possible so that the reader has the most authoratitive text in his hands. And if you can't do that, at least acknowledge the presence of all of these manuscripts. So this was not done. Here are other manuscripts:    <P>
<ol><li> <u>Escurial library, Madrid, Spain</u>. Casiri catalogue no. 1796. This manuscript is dated 582H, in Damascus. Which is merely a decade after the authors death (571H)    <P>
<li> <u>Leiden library, Netherlands</u>. Arabic manuscript no. 901. This is written before 659H, which is older than the one used by those who published <a href='../tags/al-tabyin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tabyin</font></a> (the next one).    <P>
<li> <u>Dar Kutub al-Misriyyah</u>. Date 677H.    <P>
<li> <u>Leipzig, Germany</u>. D.C no. 149. This is the one for which scans are provided below. It is written in seventh century, and on the cover page the date of 792H is written which indicates the date of possession of the manuscript.    <P>
<li> <u>Oxford, England</u>. Dozy catalogue, no. 181. This is written in 831H.  </ol>    <P>
In addition to this, there are also citations from the Tabyin by <u>Imaam al-Dhahabi</u> and <u>Ibn al-Qayyim</u> who were citing from manuscripts they had. Note in the <u>Oxford</u>, <u>Leiden</u>, and <u>Leipzig</u> manuscripts the word eye is mentioned in the dual ('aynayn). The other two have not been seen for us to state whether the singular or dual is used. And the same (use of dual) is found in al-Dhahabi's quote in <i>Mukhtasar al-'Uluww</i> (p. 242) and Ibn al-Qayyim in <i>Ijitmaa' Juyush al-Islamiyyah</i> (p. 288, Maktabah al-Rushd, 1995) whose quote is identical to what is below in the Leipzig manuscript. So all the evidence seems to show that al-Kawthari's and al-Saqaa's prints of Tabyin are erroneous in claiming ayn (eye) is mentioned in the singular in Ibn Asaakir's citation, and that two yes (aynayn) is what is correct. And it is on this error that the likes of GF Haddaad and his blind-followers based their scam which you can read about starting with   <a href=../index69b8.html?uqxke>this article</a> and <a href=../indexbaa4.html?xoufz>this one</a> and the rest that follow.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Leipzig Manuscript</font>    <P>
This is the opening page for the book:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/tabyin-leipzig-before-792H-cover.gif border=0>    <P>
Here we have the citation from the opening passage of al-Ibaanah:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/tabyin-leipzig-before-792H-f44-two-eyes.gif border=0>    <P>
The part highlighted with red line reads:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And they denied that All&#257;h has a face, despite His saying, "<b>And the Face of your Lord shall remain (the Face) full of Majesty and Honour</b>." (55:27) and they rejected that All&#257;h has two hands, despite His saying,  "<b>What I created with My Own Two Hands</b>" (38:75), and they denied that He has two eyes, despite His saying, "<b>Floating under our eyes</b>" (54:14) </blockquote>    <P>
And here is the other part where two eyes are mentioned in his citation:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/tabyin-leipzig-before-792H-f45-two-eyes.gif border=0>    <P>
The part highlighted with red line reads:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And that All&#257;h ascended over His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, as He said, "<b>The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne</b>" (20:5), and that He has a face, just as He has said, "<b>And the Face of your Lord shall remain (the Face) full of Majesty and Honour</b>." (55:27) and that He has two hands, as He said, "<b>Nay both His Hands are oustretched</b>" (5:64), and He also said, "<b>What I created with My Own Two Hands</b>" (38:75), and that He has two eyes, without kayf, as He said, "<b>Floating under our eyes</b>" (54:14)</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Concluding Remarks</font>    <P>
It is apparent that in the print editions of <i>Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari</i> (by al-Kawthari, and al-Saqaa), they have not established and verified the true and correct wordings in those two passages from the opening of al-Ibaanah which are cited by Ibn Asaakir, and it is more correct that the actual wording in all cases is "<b>aynayn</b>" (two eyes) as is evident from at least three of the manuscripts and through what is cited by other authorities like <a href='../tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim who were quoting from what they had with them.  This means that <u>the hoax and scam</u> of the likes of GF Haddaad and his blind-followers is very apparent in that they tried to use what is really an immaterial matter in the first place (the mention of eye in singular or dual), in order to hoodwink the audience. The scam is made worse by the fact that these pseudo-Asha'rites do not even affirm these <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah, as in attributes of Allaah's essence, in the first place, such that they should be in any position to be discussing one eye or two eyes. Take a look at what they say about these attributes <a href=../indexeca4.html?inevm>in this article</a> where we addressed their historical and academic fraud.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>This is very similar to another issue which we have outlined in other articles on this site. The issue of saying whether Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> "bi haddin" or "bilaa hadd" which are both reported from the Salaf and they relate to two separate matters. The affirmation of hadd refers to Allaah being separate and distinct from His creation in terms of His essence. And likewise, affirmation of hadd in terms of definition (in the sense that we can say of Allaah that He is one who is "<i>hearing, seeing, living, knowing, speaking, able, willing</i>" and so on, so this is giving definition which automatically brings something from the realm of non-existence to existence) and this is what the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were denying. And the negation of hadd refers to rejecting any definitions as to how Allaah is above His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> or how His attributes are in reality. Refer to a detailed treatment of that <a href=../indexa72a.html?hsgze>in this article</a>. Now, these pseudo-Ash'arites stick their noses into this matter and start raising the issue of Allah being above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with a "hadd" and using it to confuse people and deceive them. Now here is the real point. This discussion is only for those people who actually affirm their is a Lord above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with. If you don't affirm this, then there is no room in this discussion for you and you ought to get lost and go somewhere else. But for you to stick your nose into it and start faking all that piety and pretence of concern, its just one great big scam and fraud, and you've only exposed yourself by trying it on!</blockquote></div>    <P>

<img src=../assets/images/ibn-qayyim-tabyin-aynayn.gif align=right border=1 border=0>  To the right is an image of the quote from <i>Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftaree</i> from Ibn al-Qayyim in his book <i>Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah</i> (top) and likewise a quote from the Tabyin by <a href='../tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> (as occurs in <i>Mukhtasar al-Uluww</i>) and they are identical quotes to the two parts above in the Leipzig manuscript.    <P>
So we say: If you dont' affirm the attribute of eye for Allaah to begin with as an actual attribute of His essence (which today's <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> do not and further, they make <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of seeing (basr) to mean knowledge (ilm), so they don't really affirm "<i>basr</i>" for Allaah as an attribute), then the scholarly discussion regarding one eye or two eyes in the manuscripts of al-Ibaanah has got nothing to do you with you. You are over yonder on the other side of the fence, with <u>the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the mounds of animal fodder</u>. You are not allowed on this side of the fence with the Salaf, <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers, (whether they affirm eye in the singular or dual), it makes no difference. You are not allowed on this side of the fence to start faking concern over this  matter.     <P>
Just like in the issue of <u><a href='../tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a></u>, when your ancestors the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> began to fake concern, "Does Allaah leave His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> or not?", these doubts were first raised by the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, because it grieved them that Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He has actions tied to His will and power (such as <a href='../tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and al-nuzul) which they considered hawaadith (events, occurrences) which clashed with their proof of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. So the answer to them was that this issue is not for you, because you don't even believe there is a Lord above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with, such that this question should arise for you "Does He leave <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> or not?" Rather, this is just mischief on your behalf and doubts you are trying to create.     <P>
So these are the realities of these people, be not in doubt about it, and they simply play games and make calculated deception and rely upon the naivety of their audience, most of whom will not be in a position to research and verify matters. <P>
