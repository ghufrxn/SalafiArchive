<div class='sidebar'><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background Information</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In his essay, <i>The Origins of Islamic Platonism: The School Tradition</i> (published in P. Morewedge, "Islamic Philosophical Theology" 1979), F.E. Peters writes:     <P>
<blockquote><b>There were many varieties of Platonism in Islam. One of the earliest of the Muslim <a href='../tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>, Jahm ibn &#7778;afw&#257;n (d. 746), was promulgating a view of God remarkably different from that of his contemporaries and yet remarkably like the negative theology current in later Greek <a href='../tags/neo-platonism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Neo-Platonism</font></a>.</b> </blockquote>    <P>
The above statement is one whose detailed elaboration,  explanation and corroboration can be found in many articles throughout this website (see <a href=../series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a> in particular). The statement essentially summarizes the theology of the Mutakallimeen (speculative theologians), those who, in trying to debate with the atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> using the conceptual tools of the Greeks, were influenced and affected in the way that they spoke of Allaah, the Mighty and Exalted. And thus, the language of <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> transformed from one rooted in the language of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah to one rooted in <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a>, that of bodies (ajsaam) and accidents (<a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and to a <u>negative theology</u> (mostly expressions of what Allaah cannot be as opposed to affirming what He has affirmed for Himself of names, attributes and actions). As a result, when one reads the statements of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the books of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah, we see the Lord as described by <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and not the Lord as described by the last and final Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). "<b>How can this be?!</b>" protests the confused modern-day <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> who thinks (in his delusion) he is following the creed of Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. <b>The simple answer to this protest is that if you jump into water, you are going to get wet, stupid!</b> Thus, debating with atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> on issues such as the eternity of the universe, the plausibility of resurrection and the notion of prophethood using <u>the conceptual tools and baggage of those very same atheists and philosophers</u> is a recipe for disaster. And a disaster it was. When entering debate using these conceptual tools and terminologies <u>they were forced to make their theology consistent with and restricted to this same terminology</u>. Thus they departed from and clashed with the revealed texts, and the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> innovated <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> as a mechanism to explain away those revealed texts which clashed with their new <b>Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad</b> (theology as expressed through Aristotle's metaphysical language). This disastrous path produced, in addition to the splitting that had already occurred in the ummah in the first century hijrah, further division and dissension in the form of the sects of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidee <a href='../tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Hanafi <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, Salimiyyah and others, all of whom founded their theology on the language and baggage of <u>ilm al-kalaam (bodies and accidents)</u>, that <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which the great Imaams of the Salaf scorned and condemned and declared as heretic anyone who founded his speech regarding Allaah upon it.    <P>
<b>Aristotelian, Neo-Platonic <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Tail-End - Abu Adam Naruiji</b>    <P>
And such is the one known as <b><a href='../tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a></b>, a regular feature here at <a href=../../index.html>Asharis.Com</a>, a well-know liar, academic and intellectual fraudster, caught red-handed many times peddling his lies, spewing his resentments and hatreds against the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, declaring what the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) came with to be kufr and shirk whilst promoting an Aristotelian conception of a deity (<i>not a body, not an <a href='../tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, not within the universe, not outside the universe, not <a href='../tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, not in a location, not in space, not in a direction ...</i>) - straight out of <i>Metaphsyics 12</i> of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. When the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> such as <a href='../tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 406H) essentially reproduced <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> in their books - using motion (<i>harakah</i>) and rest (<i>sukoon</i>) as incidental attributes indicating that something is a <i><a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i> (body) and then using this to indicate the originated nature of all bodies, as a means of proving an Originator for the universe - <u>then this laid the foundation for a theology expressed through the language of Aristotle</u>. The argument through the akwaan (states of being) of motion and rest is taken from <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> argued that there has to be an unmoved mover behind all motion observed in the universe. After <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> established his "<i>unmoved mover</i>" using the issue of motion and rest, he then characterized this "<i>unmoved mover</i>" as <i>one that has no spatial extension, is not in time or space, does not have direction, location, and is not divisible</i>.  When the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> founded their theology upon this conceptual baggage, language and terminology (<u>as had Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> before them</u>), and adduced rational arguments using such language and terminology as a base and foundation <u>they were forced to speak about Allaah and His attributes only within the confines of this conceptual language</u> - thereby leading to a clash with the revealed texts. Then they (the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) innovated the mechanisms of <i><a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> (<i>tahreef</i>) and later they (the Ash'arites) innovated <i>tafweedh</i> as a means of resolving this clash and contradiction. The internal disputes between the condemned <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> then became disputes regarding what can and cannot be affirmed for Allaah in terms of names, attributes and actions in light of this new conceptual language used to speak about Allaah that was not known to any Messenger of Allaah, nor to any Companion, nor to any of the Tabi'een or great Imaams of the Salaf. And hence, the disputes between the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidee <a href='../tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Hanafi <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='../tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah - all <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> disputing with each other upon baatil (falsehood).    <P>
<b>The Great Swindle</b>    <P>
This, dear reader, is the great swindle that has been perpetrated on the ordinary Muslim, nay the ordinary aspiring <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> who thinks he is following <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, let alone thinking  he is  following the Companions, let alone thinking he is following the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). This swindle and fraud is maintained because modern-day <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as "Ash'aris" impress upon the ill-informed and ignorant that the "Asha'rites" did a great service to Islaam by refuting the atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and so on. Whilst we do not deny that in certain respects those ascribing to <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in the fifth and sixth centuries hijrah refuted certain factions such as the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Baatiniyyah, they did so unfortunately  upon the very conceptual baggage of those people they were attempting to refute, and as a result, whilst achieving some good, they brought about a lot of harm in the process - faulty tools lead to a faulty end-result. As a result they in turn went astray in important foundational issues of creed, such as <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> and attributes, when they were forced to adhere to this same conceptual baggage and terminology in speaking about their Lord. <b>This is the part that is hidden and concealed and not revealed</b>. An objective fair-minded reader and observer, when he examines the sayings of Jews who were affected by the same conceptual baggage of <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> - such  as <a href='../tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a>  Judaeus (<a href=../indexb520.html?wtxta>see here</a>) and likewise, Christians such as <a href='../tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo  (<a href=../index03de.html?wfjmn>see here</a>) and likewise, the <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=../index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>) -  and then compares their theological language with that of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah as found in their works, <u>he will be gobsmacked!</u> It is as if  they are all speaking upon the tongue of a single man when they speak about Allaah and His Attributes! As for their disputes, then they are only around subsidiary issues, after their agreement on the foundations of theology. So the dispute between the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <u>is only a subsidiary one</u> related to what can and cannot be affirmed for Allaah without clashing with the underlying foundations that both groups are actually agreed upon.    <P>
<b>Brief Synopsis of the Issue of the Qur'an</b>    <P>
We have comprehensively dealt with this in much detail in other articles on this site. Refer to <a href=../series/the-jahmite-asharis-on-the-speech-of-allah-the-quran-and-kalam-nafsee.html>this series</a> of articles. For the sake of this article here is a very quick synopsis of what is going on. When <b>al-Ja'd bin Dirham</b> and <b><a href='../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></b> brought the heritage of the <u>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</u> into this Ummah, whereby they used Aristotelian terminology (ajsaam, <a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, jawaahir [bodies, accidents, substances]) as the foundation for demonstrating the origination of the universe, they were forced to deal with the conflict this created between the revealed texts and the necessities of this newfangled theology, known as "<i><a href='../tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>". As a result, they had to deny major symbols of Islamic belief so as not to render Allaah a "<a href="../tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" as per Aristotelian terminology. Therefore, <u>Allaah's uluww</u> was denied, Allaah is not above His creation because direction implies location and location implies spatial occupation which in turn implies <a href='../tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (being a body). Likewise Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter because seeing requires direction, which implies location, which implies spatial occupation, which implies being a body (thanks <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> - <a href=../indexa9d4.html?glwlf>see here for sure!</a>). Likewise, Allaah cannot have speech because if Allaah spoke, it would consist of many instances of individual speech and all of these would be occurrences (hawaadith) or incidental attributes (<a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), necessitating change in Allaah's essence thus rendering Allaah a body (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying the proof [founded upon Aristotelian conceptual language and terminology] used to argue against the atheists and prove the origination of the universe. As such, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> cannot be the actual speech of Allaah because (to the Jahmiyyah) Allaah has no speech (since any attribute necessitates being a body).

<b>Now, an important note:</b> You might say how can you label this individual as a "Neo-Platonic Aristotelian Jahmite" when they oppose the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, argue against them and refute them? If you are shrewd enough, the answer has already preceded. We are not deceived and the wool is not pulled over our eyes just because these people argue against the atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in matters such as the origins of the universe, resurrection and prophethood. You see, these people agreed that the underlying terminology and conceptual tools of debate should be those of the atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> they were debating. <b>When they made this disastrous mistake, they were then forced to make all of their theological language to be confined and restricted to this foreign terminology (al-ajsaam wal-a'raad)</b>. As a result they ended up with a deity whose description gravitates towards a neo-Platonic, Aristotelian deity, "<i>Without magnitude, without spatial extension, without location, without direction, not a body, not an <a href='../tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, not a <a href='../tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, not divisible</i>..." and so on. This is the <u>negative theology</u> that was alluded to earlier. This is not what the Messengers came with, rather they came with specific affirmation alongside general negation of likeness (<a href='../tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>) and general negation of specification of reality (<a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>). So on the surface we see them, the condemned <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, arguing against the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, but in the reality of the matter, all of them, <u>the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Ahl al-Kalaam</u> are all united in their enmity, hatred and war against what the Salaf were upon and what their followers are upon - which is to affirm for Allaah what He affirmed for Himself and what His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) affirmed for Him, without <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> and <a href='../tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and tahreef and without <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and without denial that the words came with meanings whose realities (haqaa'iq) are unknowable and unfathomable. You will be amazed at the resemblance between how <b>al-Ghazali (d. 505H)</b> describes Allaah Most High and how <b>Ibn Sina (d. 429H)</b> describes Allaah, the Most High (<a href=../indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see this article right here</a>) yet they are the greatest of enemies, one is from the Mutakallimeen and the other from the <a href='../tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a>. Sure, they argued about the origins of the universe, resurrection and prophethood, but they were surely united in the type of deity they believed in, because they were all agreed upon the underlying language of debate. This is what the Salaf condemnded as <i><a href='../tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>, meaning, that particular language, so whoever spoke in matters of theology based upon it, they declared him astray, misguided. And this is what you see in the books of the Ash'aris and Maturidis who simply inherited it from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>  and <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> before them.  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>

<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>"The book of the Qur'aan, which is letters and words, expresses some of what A&#316;&#316;aah's attribute of Speech refers to. That is why it is called "A&#316;&#316;aah's Speech." Note again that A&#316;&#316;aah's attribute of Speech is not <a href='../tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>. It is what it refers to that is <a href='../tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>...</blockquote>    <P>
So we have moved from "<i>the Qur'aan is the eternal Speech of A&#316;&#316;aah</i>," where the Qur'aan is eternal and move in the same breath to a statement which essentially says that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> now is not the actual eternal speech of Allaah but merely an expression of that eternal speech (and not the actual eternal speech itself). This is what is known as "doublespeak" which is language that deliberately disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words and this is a hallmark of the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> theology which aims to disguise the <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Mu'tazilite usool they are really operating upon and trying to make their subsequent viewpoints appear other than what they really are. In reality, they believe in two Qur'ans but are too cowardly to openly propagate this doctrine without fear. Read the statement of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (d. 620H) exposing the <a href='../tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of his time on this very point, it is extremely revealing - it is at the end of this article.    <P>
What this Aristotelian <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> is really saying is:     <P>
<blockquote>We believe like the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the Qur'aan which we have, which Muslims recite, memorize, listen to is created. As in, the words of the Qur'aan are created. This is because we are operating upon the same foundations and conceptual tools and language that the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> founded their theology upon. Hence, we agree with their conclusion that the Qur'aan is created. However, in order to avoid the scorn and wrath of all people we will affirm something additional and try to make that synonymous with this created Qur'aan so as to veil the reality. So we will affirm what we call "<i>an indivisible eternal meaning in the self of Allaah</i>" as a double for the Qur'aan that everybody else knows of. Then in our language and characterization of our belief we will use cleverly crafted formulations and doublespeak in order to conceal the reality of our saying and <u>make it appear</u> that we believe "the Qur'an" present with us that the entire Ummah knows of is uncreated, whereas in reality we, like our <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> and Mu'tazili forerunners believe it is created (thanks al-Bayjuri - <a href=../indexf452.html?bxzbp >see here</a>). </blockquote>    <P>
It is highly appropriate here now that we bring the statements of those <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> we mentioned earlier who admitted that their saying is the same as the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that the Qur'aan is in fact created, and that the dispute between them is essentially, one of wording only.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Are United and Differ in Wording Only</font>    <P>
Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan al-Buti, a contemporary "<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" explains it really well, in the book, "Kubraa al-Yaqeeniyyaat al-Kawniyyah", al-Buti says (pp. 126-127) - <a href=../index2714.html?kiagk>see original here</a>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>They (the Mu'tazilah) had said:     <P>
<blockquote>Indeed, the sense, meaning (madlool) of the expressions (ibaaraat) to which you have applied the name of "al-kalaam an-nafsee" returns in reality to the attribute of knowledge (ilm), if this meaning is information (khabar), and returns to the attribute of wish, desire (iraadah) if it is a command (amr) or prohibition (nahee) (and you will already know that they consider the wish, iraadah  and the command, amr, to be a single meaning). As for the expressions themselves, then their words are haadithah, makhlooqah (recent, created) from Allaah - just as we have all agreed (upon this) - for they are not the attribute of Allaah, the Most High, but they are a creation from amongst His creatures, and the [word] "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is nothing but an explanation of this (meaning).</blockquote>    <P>
When you reflect upon what we have mentioned, you will have grasped the point of difference between the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah [he means the Ash'aris], and it is:    <P>
There is a meaning of the words of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> from which the command (al-amr), prohibition (an-nahee), information (al-khabar) are composed of and which are directed to mankind and which is eternal (qadeem) [referring here to the meaning, ma'naa]. So what is the name of this meaning (ma'naa)?    <P>
<u>The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> [say]</u>: It's name is knowledge (al-ilm) if it is informing with knowledge (ikhbaar), and wish, desire (al-iraadah) if it is  command or prohibition.    <P>
<u>The majority (meaning of the Ash'aris) [say]</u>: It's name is "al-kalaam an-nafsee", and it is an attribute in addition to both knowledge (ilm) and wish (iraadah), which is established with the essence of Allaah.    <P>
<b>As for the speech (al-kalaam) which is the wording (al-lafdh), then they are agreed (the Ash'aris and Mu'tazilah) that it is created (makhlooq), and that it is not established with His, the Sublime's essence</b>...    <P>
... And though we believe what the majority [i.e. of the Ash'aris] have tended to that the meaning (ma'naa, present with Allaah) which is the [original] sense, or meaning (madlool) behind of the expressions (ibaaraat), is name is "al-kalaam an-nafsee", and that it is an attribute in addition to both the attribute of knowledge and wish (al-ilm wal-iraadah), <b>except that the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are all agreed, entirely, with the majority [meaning of <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholars] in affirming this meaning for Allaah, the Most High, and that it is an eternal attribute established with His essence, even if they do not call it "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" like we do</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
<u>So what is al-Buti saying in essence?</u> He is saying that the Ash'aris and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are all agreed that the Qur'aan (the lafdh) is created. Thereafter the Ash'aris and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> disagree on what label they apply to what the Ash'aris consider to be the uncreated speech of Allaah. The Ash'aris say it is "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (a meaning in the self of Allaah). [How they came to this view has been discussed in other articles, this view was innovated by <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and is founded upon a line of poetry from a Trinitarian Christian called al-Akhtal]. And the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> argue that this is nothing but Allaah's <u>knowledge</u> (if it relates to information) and Allaah's <u>will</u> (if it relates to a command). In other words, what you <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are labelling as "<i>a meaning in the self</i>" is no different to Allaah's "<i>knowledge and will</i>"  to us the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, which we consider to be synonymous with the essence of Allaah, as we do not accept multiplicity of attributes, so we are just referencing the same thing through different labels. So the Mu'tazili argument is that this additional thing you are attempting to affirm (<a href='../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>) doesn't exist, it is nothing but knowledge and will which we, the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, treat as being synonymous with the essence, not distinct attributes. This is a very frank and honest admission of the reality of the saying of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> by al-Buti here (and it was also stated in a different way by <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> and al-Razi). And it is here that the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> got such a mighty pounding by the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and for which they had no answer (al-Aamidee [an <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> d. 631H], <u>poor soul</u>, he couldn't hack it and had to throw in the towel):    <P>
<ul><li> <b>How the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Slapped the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Into Intellectual Oblivion and Made Mockery of Their Intelligence</b> - Between The Multiplicity of Attributes and the Doctrine of the Indivisible <a href='../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> - (<a href=../index2cfa.html?zjxdz>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>And so from this, we see the swindle of this neo-Platonic Aristotelian <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> laid bare in that he is in reality with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> whom the Imaams of the Salaf scorned, condemned and made takfir of in the second and third centuries.

<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Qudamah al-Maqidis's Unveiling of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in His Time Which is Also An Unveiling of This Neo-Platonic Aristotelian <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, <a href="../tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Adam <a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a></font>    <P>
The final speech in this opening article has to be given to Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (rahimahullaah), (you can read the full Arabic <a href=../indexb6ea.html?ilvva>in this article here</a>), Ibn Qudaamah (d. 620H) said in his book, "<i>Hikaayat ul-Munaadharah fil-Qur'aan Ma'a Ba'd Ahl il-Bid'ah</i>" (Narrative of the Debate Regarding the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with Some of the People of Innovation) - which is his documenting of his debate with the Ash'aris on the subject of the Qur'aan (pp. 34-35):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And the focus of [these] people [the Ash'arites] is to [say] the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and to agree with the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but they love that this should not be known about them, so they embarked upon [sophistry] that [amounts] to arrogant rejection of observable reality, and rejection of the realities, and opposition to the consensus (ijmaa), and throwing the Book and the Sunnah behind their backs, and speaking with something that no one before them has said, neither Muslim nor Disbeliever.    <P>
And it is strange that they are not daring enough to proclaim their [real] saying openly, and nor to explicitly state it, except in secluded gatherings, even if they were [ones] in authority (i.e. rulers) and were the leaders of the state. And if you were to quote [to others] from their saying that they believe, they would hate it and reject it and become arrogant over it.     <P>
They do not outwardly show except veneration of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and respect of the masaahif (copies of the Qur'an), and standing up (maintaining respect for it) when seeing it. But in the secluded gatherings, they say, "There is nothing in them (the masaahif) except paper and ink, and what else is in them [but that]?"    <P>
And I had quoted some of what had been said by one with whom there was a debate - between me and him - and he became angry and it was burdensome to him, and he is one of the greatest of rulers in the land. And he did not reveal explicitly his saying until I was in seclusion with him, and he said, "I wish to say to what is in the innermost part of myself, and you (in turn) say to me what is in the innermost part of yourself", and he made their saying (that of the Ash'aris) clear to me, along the lines of what we have [already] quoted from them. And when I presented some verse, making it binding upon him [to accept] that they indicate the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is these [very] surahs (chapters) [in letter and word], he said, "And I say this is the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (as well). But this is not the eternal <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>." I said, "So do we have two Qur'ans?". He said, "Yes, and what will happen if we have two Qur'ans?"    <P>
When I quoted this saying from him (to others) he became angry.    <P>
And some of our companions said to him: "You are the rulers (wulaat ul-amr), the leaders of the state, so what prevents you from openly proclaiming your saying to the general folk, and calling people to speak with it between them."    <P>
So he was refuted and did not [thereafter] respond to me.    <P>
And we do not know amongst the people of innovation, any faction who conceal their saying, and do not have the boldness to proclaim it (openly) except the Heretics (Zanaadiqah) and the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>.    <P>
And Allaah, the Exalted, order His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) to openly proclaim the religion, to call to it, and to convey what Allaah revealed to Him, so the Most High said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'><b> O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind. (Al-Ma'idah 5:67) </b><img src='../images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So if their saying - as they claim - is the truth, then why do they not openly proclaim it and call the people to it?    <P>
And how is it lawful for them to hide it and conceal it, and to proclaim openly what is different to it, deceiving the public [into thinking they] believe other than it? Rather, if their saying was the truth that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam),  His Companions, and the Imaams of the religion after them were upon, how come not one of them openly proclaimed it? And did they all concur upon concealing it?    <P>
Or how was it lawful for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) to conceal it from his ummah whilst he had been ordered to convey what had been revealed to him, and had beed threatened against concealing anything from it with His saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'><b> And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. (Al-Ma'idah 5:67) </b><img src='../images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And how was it possible for him to make the people presume (something) in opposition to the truth?</blockquote>    <P>
May Allaah reward Ibn Qudaamah (rahimahullaah) immensely for bringing out the innermost secrets of these heretics for all of posterity to see until the Hour is established.     <P>
End of Part 1. To be continued inshaa'Allaah...   <P>
