<img src=../assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In a previous article (<a href=../index556a.html?nsiuy >see here</a>, at the end), we explained an unfortunate situation that developed in the 20th century when a new species of <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> came on the scene to pollute the atmosphere. This was represented in the Hanafi-Maturidi called Muhammad Zahid <a href='../tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a>, a shrewd and cunning academic shyster, and extremely bigoted Hanafi, who brought a new type of enmity against Ahl al-Sunnah and whose lies, deceptions and distortions, and attacks upon the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact the Imaams of the Salaf, was documented by the likes of the Shaykh, Abdu al-Rahmaan al-Mu'allami al-Yamaanee in his book <i>al-Tankeel Bimaa Fee Ta'neeb <a href='../tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> Min al-Abaateel</i>.      <P>
<blockquote>This species of <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> coupled intense hatred along with academic dishonesty and unfortunately is the one dominant today on the blogs, forums, websites and discussions and the likes. What this species has produced is an unnecessary cluttering and pollution of the environment, a type of mist and fog, that brings unncessary confusion in addition to the confusion that already exists. Being ignorant (or pretending to be ignorant) of the true and real positions of the Salaf as well as having a crooked intent (excluding the sincere clueless who are just caught up in this whirlwind),  they spread lies and misquote the Imaams of the Salaf, and misrepresent the actual issues - far away from any meaningful, beneficial, true academic type of discussion. These mischief-makers (who are a very devious and crooked type of pseudo-Ash'ari and Maturidi) sit in the middle and their aim is to lie, swindle, deceive, distort, fabricate, confuse, distort to hearts content so that there remains a great cloud of confusion created in the middle where no one knows what on earth is going on, and and no one knows who really says what and who really believes what, and the aim behind all of it is to prevent people from coming to know the true and real Salafi aqidah. So when you have Muslims who are sincere and they want to follow the truth, it becomes extremely difficult for them to find out the real aqidah of the Salaf, because of all the confusion, diversion and misrepresentation they have to wade through. A lot of them just give up, fatigued. </blockquote>    <P>
Once you acknowledge this (and you will have to by the time you have read this article in full inshaa'Allaah), you will see what difference there is between those from the generality of the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> (in this case a Hanafi-Maturidi [<i><a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></i> is an umbrella term for both groups]) who display insaaf (justice) and sidq (honesty) in how they characterize the view of their opponents and between the straying, wandering, lying, deceiving, treacherous pied-pipers (who lead) and their clueless zombies (who follow) that you find trolling the web and creating fitnah for the Ummah.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><a href="../tags/muhammad-anwar-shah-al-kashmiri.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhammad Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri</font></a></font>    <P>
He is a Hanafi-Maturidi-Deobandi scholar (d. 1352H) and he has explanations of the books of hadeeth such as the Saheeh of al-Bukhari and the Sunan of al-Tirmidhi and dictations and marginal notes on Muslim, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah.     <P>
<img src=../assets/images/kashmiri-arf-shadhi-cover.gif border=1 hspace=2 border=0>    <img src=../assets/images/kashmiri-bukhari-cover.gif border=1 hspace=2 border=0>     <P>
To the above are the covers for the books <i>al-Arf al-Shadhiyy Sharh Sunan al-Tirmidhi</i> (tahqiq, Muhammad Shakir, Dar Ihyaa al-Turath al-Arabi, 2004), and <i>Faid al-Bari alaa Sahih al-Bukhari</i> (Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2005). We are going to quote his commentary on the hadeeth pertaining to the Nuzul (descent) of Allaah, the Exalted, as it contains a valuable explanation about the issue of <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>, hadath, <a href='../tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>, makhluq, and the confusion in these terms as it relates to the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (Allaah's chosen actions). And likewise his commentary on certain chapters in al-Bukhari's <i>Kitab al-Tawhid</i> relating to the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Allaah's speech.    <P>
As for his belief, then he is a Maturidi, and naturally, we consider him in opposition to the Salaf in his doctrinal views, and thus whatever refutations are found with the Salaf and their followers, past and present, against the schools of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and the likes would be applicable. However, what we find here (in the quote that we are going to present and comment on) is a display of honesty and justice that you will not find these days (for the reasons mentioned above in the introduction).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> It would be a good idea to do some background reading on this subject which we have already covered in previous articles. In particular refer to    <a href=../index7f59.html?nubev>this article</a>, <a href=../index7917.html?bvhjb>this one</a> and <a href=../index5bb7.html?ramab>this one</a>. That will give you a good primer.</div> <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So you can follow along with us, we will provide the entire chapter. <b><a href=../dld7825.html?a=kashmiri-nuzul-commentary.pdf>Download the PDF file</a></b> of al-Kashmiri's commentary on the hadeeth of al-Nuzul. We will be focusing on page 417 of the 1st volume, as that is where the relevant commentary is. An acknowledgement here to Abu Turab Ali Rida who directed us to a resource through which we were able to investigate and locate the original of this particular quotation of al-Kashmiri.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Context of the Quote</font>    <P>
The quote we are going to present below occurs as commentary on the hadeeth of al-Nuzul (descent), and this is cited on page 414, the hadith of Abu Hurairah (radiallaahu anhu) which is also in the two Sahihs. There is a bit of discussion before we come to the actual passage we are interested in, and so we can summarize that discussion in the following points:    <P>
<blockquote><b>One:</b> [p. 415]  Mention that al-Nuzul (descent) is a matter of aqidah and not fiqh, and that a generalized belief in it is sufficient, as is mentioned in al-Fiqh al-Akbar which is a work authored by Abu Mutee' al-Balkhee, a student of <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, and who al-Kashmiri deems to be saduq (truthful).    <P>
<b>Two:</b> [p. 415] A discussion of the view of the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (Aristotle, al-Farabi, Ibn Sina) on the attributes and the attribute of existence (wujood), and their rejection of qudrah (power) and iraadah (wish), and within this the mention of whether the attributes are synonymous with the essence or something additional to the essence. Also a mention that the difference in the views of the Sufis and the Mutakallimeen regarding whether the attributes are the very essence or other than the essence is a difference in wording only, and a brief explanation of this matter.    <P>
<b>Three:</b> [p. 415-516] A brief mention that the actions of Allaah have wisdom behind them (mu'allalah bil-hikam), and that a complete cause ('illah taammah) precedes the thing being caused (ma'lul) with a precedence in time.    <P>
<b>Four:</b> [p. 416] He refers to this hadeeth of al-Nuzul to be from the <i>mutashaabihaat</i> and includes <a href='../tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> within these matters. This is not the way of the Salaf, and they never referred to these matters as the <i>mutashaabihaat</i> as far as their meanings are concerned. Al-Kashmiri says: "The view of the Salaf regarding them is having faith (al-eemaan) upon the apparentness (dhaahir) of what is granted to be upon its apparentness <u>without ta'weel</u> and <u>without takyif</u> and relegating (yufawwadu) the matter of <u>their kaifiyyah</u> to Allaah, the Exalted." We have to remember that al-Kashmiri is a Maturidi, and the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> often make expressions that appear to be approximate to what Ahl al-Sunnah say, except that how they explain these expressions is upon a way other than what the Salaf were upon.     <P>
Then he mentions [p.416] the way of the Mutakallimeen (<a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>) and says about them that they claim the way of the Salaf to be tafweed (i.e. of the meaning) which is safer (aslam), and that their madhhab (the Mutakallimeen) is making <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> through reason (aql) in conformity with the legislation (shar') and that this is more precise (ahkam). Al-Kashmiri says (that upon this view of the Mutakallimin) it means that the foundational basis of Ahl al-Sunnah (to them, the Mutakallimin) is making tafweed, and as for <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> then it is only resorted to out of necessity, when countering those who oppose the Sunnah. Al-Kashmiri says that the Mutakallimin resorted to these ta'weels when they were debating the opposers to Islaam.  Then he mentions two other categories of people, those who made ta'weels in agreement with their reason (aql) which oppose the Sharee'ah, and the <a href='../tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> who said Allaah is a  <a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) like all the bodies.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>We say:</b> That this position of the Mutakallimin (in regards to <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed ascribed to the Salaf) is baatil (falsehood) and this way was never found amongst the Salaf in relation to the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>. This is despite the fact that they came across falsehood and they came upon the zanaadiqah and the malaahidah (heretics, disbelievers, opposers to Islaam). They are the ones (the Sahaabah and Taabi'een) who conquered the lands in which there were  many factions of non-Muslims and various civilizations and various creeds, and it is not known from any of them that they resorted to this methodology or the use of innovated theological language. Rather, the truth of the matter is that the there appeared the likes of al-Ja'd and al-Jahm who adopted the conceptual tools of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=../series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>), and used it to debate the atheists, and this approach was taken and refined by the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the form of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (the origination of bodies), to prove the universe is created, and they were forced to remain consistent with this proof by denying the names, attributes and actions. Hence they innovated things not known to the Salaf and started raising issues like <u>a)</u> separating the deen into usool and furoo' and <u>b)</u> the issue of majaaz and haqeeqah in the the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and <u>c)</u> innovating <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (which is really tahreef) as a means to deal with those  problematic texts that affirm attributes and actions, and <u>d)</u> trying to distinguish between mutawaatir and aahaad (in terms of what amounts to knowledge) and so on. These approaches characterize the reality of what the doctrines and viewpoints of the schools of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) are founded upon - which is conflict between revelation and reason and giving reason precedence. Amongst them were those who tended towards <a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> through this same <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, like the Raafidee <a href='../tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, but they were all united around this proof of huduth al-ajsaam and trying to maintain its major premises. Some were let to <a href='../tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and others were led to <a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>. </div>    <P>
<b>Four:</b> [p. 416] After mentioning the way of the Salaf and the way of the Mutakallimeen, he then addresses the issue of the tafweed ascribed to the Salaf. He says, that the tafweed ascribed to the Salaf can bear two meanings. <u>The first</u> is pure relegation [of the meaning] to Allaah without showing any rejection against those who made <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> in whatever way they made <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> due to the reason that they affirmed they do not to have knowledge (i.e. are wholly ignorant of the meaning of the text). <u>The second</u> making tafweed only of the details (tafseel) and the how (<a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>), and leaving that knowledge to Allaah as well as showing rejection against those who  made <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> through his opinion and reason. Al-Kashmiri says that the tafweed of the Salaf <u>is this second meaning</u>, not the first one. Again, bear in mind that al-Kashmiri could intend by the word "tafseel" (detail), the actual "ma'naa" (meaning), and thus the way of the Salaf to him is tafweed of the ma'naa and kaifiyyah together, except he chose to express ma'naa through the word tafseel, which obscures matters a little.    <P>
<b>Five:</b> We have to remember that al-Kashmiri is a Maturidi and he considers there to be groups who make <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> that are also upon the truth. He says that those who make <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> are of three groups, and he mentions those who are <u>a)</u> the specialists of the language who use metaphors and allegories and the likes, <u>b)</u> the Sufis who make ta'weels like Allaah's nuzul being "manifestation"  and <u>c)</u> the <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the Mutakallimeen. He says that the third group, the Mutakallimin, are divided into the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the Maturidis. He says that when the label "<a href="../tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a>" is used it includes the Maturidis.    <P>
<b>Six:</b> [p. 416] He then describes the two groups, Ash'aris and Maturidis. He says the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> affirm <i>sifaat dhaatiyyah qadeemah azaliyyah</i> (eternal attributes of the essence) which are the seven, <i>knowledge, hearing, seeing, power, wish, speech and life</i>, and that they also affirm <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> (actions) but that these are hawaadith (events) and creations of Allaah, and are not established with Allaah Himself (meaning these actions are not established with Allaahs essence). As for the Maturidis, he says that they say the attributes of Allaah are seven, and they are eternal. And as for the <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> (such as giving life, taking life, anger, pleasure) they are also eternal. He says that the Maturidis put all of the various types of <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> under one genus, and called it al-takween, and they make this an eighth attribute for Allaah.     <P>
<b>Seven:</b> [p. 417] He then mentions the position of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> that whilst Allaah's attributes are eternal (like wish, power etc.) their associations (ta'alluqaat) with things are hawaadith (recent events). What he is referring to here is the attempt of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to connect Allaah's attributes of wish and power and the likes (which are eternal) to the recency of created things and so they came up with the concept of "ta'alluq" (association), which is really <u>an imaginary connection</u> between Allaah's eternal wish and power with the things wished for (muraadaat) and under Allaah's power (maqdooraat). This attempt by the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> does not establish any true and real connection in external reality (it is just word play), because if their was, it would falsify their entire doctrinal school as they would be obliged to accept what they refer to as hawaadith in Allaah's essence, since the element of recency would have to come into those attributes (power, wish, hearing, seeing).    <P>
<b>Eight:</b> [p. 417] He then says, that from the Maturidi perpective (as the Maturidis see it),  there is another matter that is connected to Allaah, and which is also called <i>fi'l</i> (action), he says that this labelling of it as <i>fi'l</i> is from himself and it is the likes of Allaah's nuzul to the lowest heaven and other such matters which are connected to Allaah Himself but which cannot be from the type which are eternal in Allaah. He says, these actions are "hawaadith", and he says that the Maturidiyyah say that they are not established with Allaah, rather they are from His creation.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>We say:</b> Note that this is the same view as the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, except that the Maturidis distinguish between those actions they include within al-takween and make eternal (like ihyaa, imaatah, tazreeq, <a href='../tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>, ghadab) and those they do not like <a href='../tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, al-nuzul and the likes.

It is at this point now that we come the passage that is relevant to our purpose in this article. Before we proceed to it, an important observation needs to be kept in mind.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>An Important Observation Regarding Language and Terminology</font>    <P>
It is vital to understand that the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> schools of theology (Ash'aris and Maturidis) have a particular language (not known to the Salaf) and they make use of terms and phrases to describe and characterize certain views. In this particular case, they use the word "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) to refer to the actions of Allaah tied to His will and power. Thus, when you come to read the speech of al-Kashmiri, you should be aware of the type of language he is using to characterize the view of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (which is the view of the Salaf), and you have to see beyond and above the terminology he is using and simply grasp the actual meanings and concepts that he is explaining and putting across. We do not agree with this terminology, and it is not from the way of the Salaf to speak of Allaah's actions (af'aal) in this manner.    <P>

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>What he is referring to as <i>hawaadith</i> are the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> ikhtiyaariyyah, those actions that are tied to Allaah's choice, will, power and which He is not permanently described with, or those which are indeed permanent in their genus but are tied to will and power (like speech) as it relates to their instances. These includes the likes of ridaa (pleasure), <a href='../tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a> (anger), mahabbah (love), dahak (laughter), ajab (amazement), nuzul (descent), <a href='../tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascent),  majee' (coming), <a href='../tags/ityaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ityaan</font></a> (arriving) and so on. The Salaf never  referred to these as hawaadith, and nor did <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, rather we see the Salaf affirming all these matters, without distinguishing them from the permanent attributes, like ilm (knowledge), qudrah (power), sam' (hearing), basr (seeing) and what is similar to them. <b>Their approach was consistent and uniform, which is to make <a href='../tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) of <u>everything</u> without distinction and to negate <a href='../tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> (likening) and <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> (specifying the reality)</b>. And they waged war against the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and their offshoots who rejected these <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> in a variety of different ways, from them, by claiming they are eternal (such as with love, pleasure and anger), or by claiming that they are not established with Allaah's essence, but are simply what take place in the creation. So these approaches were taken by the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> towards the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes) and these approaches were borrowed by the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah from the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and applied to the af'aal (actions). So we do not refer to these as hawaadith,  this is purely the terminology of <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, because their entire orientation has its roots in the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which they took from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (through the route of <u>al-Ja'd bin Dirham</u>, to <u><a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a></u> to the <u><a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u> through to the <u>Raafidah</u>, and to the <u><a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u> and <u><a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, and to the <u><a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u> and <u>Maturidiyyah</u>). Hence, they have a particular theological language that is unique to them, through which they characterize not just their own doctrinal views, but also those of others (who are not from the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups) from those who do not agree to this language in the first place. For this reason, these people have made mistakes in characterizing the views of Ahl al-Sunnah in certain areas, because they were looking at them with clouded vision. This is very prominent in the issue of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>As we said, al-Kashmiri, coming from the kalam theology schools, is characterizing the matter through the  language of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. The actions of Allaah (af'aal), if they are said to be established with His essence and tied to His choice and will, such that Allaah is not permanently and eternally described with, by way of example, pleasure, anger, <a href='../tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, nuzul, and specific instances of speech (not the genus of speech), and so on, all of this is labelled as "hawaadith" to the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologists. So in this passage from al-Kashmiri, you have to remember that we are discussing concepts through the labels and terms of the kalam theologists, so we are going to have to work with him on this, because the objective here is to see how al-Kashmiri is honest and decent enough to characterize truthfully the viewpoint of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, even if it be upon innovated language, and this is in stark contrast to the riff-raff from the hooligans, clueless zombies, dishonest swindlers and others who are from the school of al-Kawthari, GF Haddaad, Keller and others. As we shall see, that what al-Kashmiri is attributing to <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (and the Salaf) is correct in meaning, but the terminology he is using is not correct, and we neither agree with it or accept it.  </blockquote>    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">...And he [Ibn Taymiyyah] said: Between [what is] <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (recent) and [what is] makhluq (created) there is generality (umoom) and specificity (khusoos), for the attributes [of action] which are haadithah (have recency) and all of the things of the universe are hawaadith (of recent occurrence). But the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes of action) <u>are not created</u>, unlike all of the things of the universe [whose existence is] possible.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This is a characterization of the view of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (and of the Salaf) through the language of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology. In simple terms all it means is that Allaah is described with certain actions, which are established with His essence, which are tied to His will and power, and therefore they are said to be of recent occurrence (<a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>) when they take place through His will and power. So an example would be Allaah's speech, not in its genus (which is eternal) but in its specific instances. He spoke to the Angels before creating Aadam (alayhis salaam), and He created Aadam and spoke to Aadam, just as He spoke to Iblis, and He also spoke to Messengers, like Musa and Muhammad (alayhimaa as-salaam) and He will speak on the Day of Judgement, to the Believers and likewise to the inhabitants of the Fire and so on. All of these are instances of speech that are not the same as each other, rather they are different instances of speech and they occur at different "times".    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important Note Concerning Time</b>. The issue of "time" (<i>zamaan</i>) is a topic we have not covered in-depth yet, and there are found amongst the Ash'aris and Maturidis who utter the statement "<i>Allaah is outside of time</i>" without really knowing what they are saying. This is because they are conceiving of a theological idea that exists only in the mind, and it does not exist in external reality. This <u>does not</u> mean we are saying that Allaah is enclosed by time, since Allaah created all time, and Allaah existed and there was no time [and this leads to the question as to what is the "time" being referred to here], but what it means is that <u>the idea</u> they are trying to conceive of in their minds in trying to deny Allaah has speech and action (<i>al-kalaam wal-fi'l</i>) tied to His will and power is such that it really implies Allaah's non-existence, through the non-existence of his <i>sifat fi'liyyah muta'addiyah</i> and <i><a href='../tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i> except that they can't really see it, and it is impossible for them to reconcile what they are saying "<i>Allaah is outside of time</i>" with what is plain and manifest in <u>thousands</u> of revealed texts that Allaah speaks and acts with choice and that His speech and action is mentioned in thousands of revealed texts in relation to time. Inshaa'Allaah we will dedicate a series of articles that explain the position and view of the Salaf in this matter in detail. For now, what we can say briefly is that <b>Allaah is the creator of times (azminah, measurements of time)</b>, and there are different measurements of time, we have our created measurement of days and years (through movement of the sun and moon), and there is also another created measurement of time of days and years that is with Allaah (a day with Allaah is a thousand years of our reckoning). Likewise on the Day of Judgement there is a measurement of time (that day lasts 50,000 years) and in Paradise their will also be measurement of time (morning, evening, week). So we affirm time is created, as in relational time. At the same time there is an altogether separate issue which is that Allaah has speech and action tied to His will and power and that He has eternally been "<b>the doer of whatever He wills</b>" (2:253, 11:107, 22:14, 85:16). It is not binding that <u>because</u> Allaah speaks and acts as He wills, with choice, that His speech and action is now "encapsulated by time", for Allaah has eternally been one who speaks and acts as He wills, before He created the azminah (times), and time is simply measurement of motion. Further, it is <u>because</u> He is one who speaks and acts by choice that we are able to make sense of the multitudes of revealed texts that make mention of Allaah speaking and acting <u>within the context of specific times</u> as it relates to our measurement of time, or in an altogether different measurement of time that is with Allaah. <b>We can give two examples to illustrate what has just been said</b>. <u>The first</u>, the Angels that ascend to Allaah at Fajr and Asr and who inform Allah, even though He knows best about His servants, as to what state they left them in. So here is an example of Allah's speech (because He speaks to those Angels) mentioned in relation to time, and it happens to be our measurement of time. Imaam al-Bukhari brings under numerous chapter headings in Kitab al-Tawhid from his Sahih, many ahaadeeth which are like this, to establish that Allaah speaks as and when He wills, such that He spoke to Moses, and speaks to Jibreel and will speak on the Day of Judgement and so on, as a refutation of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (and their offshoots). <u>The second</u>, is the six days of creation, so there are days with Allaah other than the days of this creation (and that measurement of time is also created, and each of those days is equivalent to a thousand years of our time), and Allaah made <a href='../tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> after creating the heavens and earth in that measurement of six days, as is stated in six verses in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (7:54, 10:3, 13:2, 25:59, 32:4, 57:4). Likewise, Allaah wrote the decrees 50,000 years before creating the heavens and earth and this measurement of years is other than our measurement of years. So we are able to reconcile all these texts and still believe that Allaah <u>is not enclosed and encapsulated by time</u>, because we affirm <u>Allah has actions tied to His will and power</u> - something which all the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups fled from because they deemed this to be "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) that would clash with their proof of huduth al-ajsaam whose fundamental principle is "<i>Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith (events, occurrences), is itself <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated)</i>." As a result, they took certain approaches to deny and eliminate the element of choice (ikhtiyaar) from Allaah's actions to maintain their <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology. As part of this approach, they say "Allaah is outwith time" and they are just dazed and confused. What they are doing here is conceiving of something in the mind that clashes with external reality. They see the thousands of revealed texts which clearly mention Allaah's speech and action in the context of time, and then because they are operating upon that <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology that must reject what they define as "hawaadith" for Allaah (otherwise the proof for His existence is destroyed), then they are forced to make statements like "Allaah is outwith time" as a means of psychological comfort to their souls which have been disturbed by those thousands of revealed texts and for which they have absolutely no explanation and to which they turn a blind-eye or simply flee from. And when they make this statement, they don't really grasp what they are saying, and at the same time, if they were honest in their souls, they would know and admit that the revealed texts are blatanly in opposition to their particular conception of this matter. Rather, the truth lies in what we have stated, which is what is manifest in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and what the Salaf were upon.</div></blockquote>    <P>

The language of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the language of the Arabs and the view of the Salaf is that what is <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> is not necessarily what is makhluq (created).

But note here how he indicates that the explainers of al-Bukhari's Sahih [such as Ibn Hajar] tried to give their own interpretation to what al-Bukhari said.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>We have explained in other articles that the likes of Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani fall into a category of Scholars who never fundamentally delved into <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, rather they were attached to hadeeth and its sciences. However, they grew up and acquired knowledge in a certain setting, climate and environment where the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were the majority. They deemed the conclusions of the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> to be correct, even though themselves never delved into the study of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. Then they tried to merge these conclusions with their knowledge of hadeeth (their main preoccupation), and for this reason you will often see the expressions and language of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> appearing in their writings, despite the fact that they themselves condemned the very <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> that the conclusions of <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were based upon in the first place (<a href=../index8c76.html?ublmv>see this article for example</a>). You will also see a type of idtiraab (shakiness, inconsistency) in their writings, as is clear with Ibn Hajar himself. And al-Kashmiri has alluded here that on this particular issue, the explainers of the Sahih (like Ibn Hajar) made <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the speech of al-Bukhari. Inshaa'Allaah we will look at this in more detail in the <a href=../indexda56.html?mbeif>next article</a> where we cite the relevant sections from al-Bukhari's Sahih (along with al-Kashmiri's commentary). As for this category of Scholars like <a href='../tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, <a href='../tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar refer to our comments in these articles (<a href=../index01b6.html?wlodz>this one</a>, and <a href=../index2670.html?kagzi>this one</a> and <a href=../index44b5.html?syiyr>this one</a>).</div>  </blockquote>    <P>

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Here al-Kashmiri has explained the difference between huduth (recency) and khalq (creation) in the course of explaining the view of <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) and his students.  He says that they (like the Salaf) speak with the recency of the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee, meaning that Allaah speaks with His will and power, meaning He chooses to speak when He wills. In this regarad, al-Kashmiri makes reference to the treatise written by <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) on this subject in particular. In light of all of this, al-Kashmiri exonerates <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> from being a <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>. You have to understand what he means here, he is saying that upon what is correct in the language (that <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> is not synomymous with makhluq), and upon what supports <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (against the Ash'arites) from the language, that <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (recent) is not synonymous with makhluq (created), and upon the view of <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and students that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an attribute of Allaah with the wording of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (al-lafdh) being of recent occurrence [as in tied to Allah's will and power, meaning choice], then <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> is not a <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, since this saying does not mean the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created!</blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">So the essence [of the matter] is that the descent (nuzul) of the Creator to the lowest heaven is a true and real nuzul (haqeeqah), that is to be carried upon its dhaahir (apparentness), and [the knowledge of] its tafseel and <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> is to be relegated to the Creator, lofty be His manifest evidence, and this is the madhhab of the four Imaams and the Righteous Salaf as has been quoted by al-Haafidh [Ibn  Hajar] in Fath al-Baaree. </font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This statement of al-Kashmiri should be read and understood in light of what he said earlier in verifying what the actual madhhab of the Salaf is with respect to tafweed. And he clarified earlier that their way was to affirm a text upon its dhaahir (apparentness), reject <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, and to consign the tafseel (detail) and <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> (how) to Allaah. And this agrees with what is known that the Salaf made tafweed of the takyif, and not of the meaning (ma'naa) that is dhaahir (apparent) from the text, except that you have to understand that the Ash'aris and Maturidis often use expressions to make their views appear as close as possible to the Salaf (in wording at least), whereas in the actual interpretation of those expressions (in private study), they mean something else. So when he says that the Salaf made tafweed of the <u>tafseel</u> and the <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, it is possible that by <i>tafseel</i> he intends the <i>ma'naa</i> (meaning). So one should be aware of this.</blockquote>    <P>

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Now this needs some elaboration. What we have here is essentially an <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> versus Maturidi treatment of the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>. Now after al-Kashmiri did justice in explaining the view of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, and <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, the Imaams and the Salaf as a whole - even if it was through the language of the people of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> - he is now addressing a purely <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> versus Maturidi issue.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Recall that the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are all united upon negating what they call hawaadith from Allaah, which essentially means Allah's chosen actions. This was inherited by the Ash'aris and Maturidis from the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had certain approaches towards the attributes such as claiming that the attributes are not established with Allaah but are merely the attributes in the creation which can be said to be Allaah's. Or they said that the attributes are synonymous with the essence. And the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> said about the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, they are acts which take place in the creation, not with Allaah (so istiwaaa is an act that takes place in <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and nuzul is an act in the creation, and likewise those  transitive actions, like creating, providing, giving life, taking life and so on, they are not actions established with Allaah himself, but the very thing that takes place in the creation itself, meaning the creation, or the provision, or the life, or the death). And likewise they say that pleasure and anger are synonymous with the iraadah (wish) and not independent attributes. And the Maturidis had another approach, they simply took all of the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> and put them under an umbrella term, and called it al-takween, which they made to be eternal. So this is one of the numerous issues of difference between the Ash'aris and Maturidis. <b>In reality, both the Ash'aris and Maturidis took the same approach towards the <i><a href='../tags/sifat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> that the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> did with the <a href='../tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a>, using essentially the same methodological procedure</b>. And the driving force behind it all is that all of them (Mu'tazilah, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) are operating upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, since they have used this method to prove the universe is created and therefore has a creator, and this leads to the plausibility of miracles (since Allaah has hayat, ilm, iraadah and qudrah) to demonstrate the truthfulness of the Messenger which in turn demonstrates the truthfulness of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. It is only then, that you can start deducing evidence with the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (because before you establish all of that, you would be falling into circular reasoning by using the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to prove the Qur'an). <u>This is essentially their theology and it all starts with proving the universe is originated</u>, and this is what they call <b>Usul al-Din</b>, and hence, you will understand their saying "<i>the first obligation is to observe and reflect (al-nadhar wal-istidlaal)</i>", or "<i>to have the intent (qasd) to do so</i>" and some of them said "<i>to assume doubt (shakk) and then to observe and reflect</i>" and what they mean by observe and reflect is to prove the universe is originated through pure <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. So they borrowed the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in that regard (the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad) and this in turn forced them to take a position towards <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions. They just differed amongst themselves as to what they saw the binding necessities of this proof. So the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> said we must negate everything, names, attributes and actions. The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said we must negate the attributes and actions, and the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> said we must affirm some attributes, negate others, and negate all the actions, and the same with the Maturidiyyah. They are all one family in reality. However, in trying to reach essentially the same objective, they obviously had differences, and as such there are refutations between them.</div>    <P>
It is here that we understand the polemics between the Ash'aris and the Maturidis on how to deal with the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>. So the Ash'aris said that because these actions are hawaadith (events) they must be created and therefore can only be referring to entities and actions that occur in the creation, and not actions established with Allaah's essence. Hence the particular approach they took.  From a Maturidi viewpoint, this is not correct, because they consider all of Allaah's <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> to be an eternal attribute (called al-takwin) and therefore are not hawaadith (as the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> claim).    <P>
<b>So here al-Kashmiri is rebutting (from a Maturidi perspective) the <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> argument. In order for us to understand this rebuttal of al-Kashmiri we have to first explain the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> viewpoint and their treatment of  attributes such as iraadah (wish) and power (qudrah).</b>    <P>
This is done with the following:     <P>
When the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took the viewpoint that they did and the particular method they used to deal with this problem of hawaadith as it relates to Allaah's <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, they put themselves into a problem (and this problem also actually lies with the Maturidis too). Which is how do you explain the relationship between Allaah's attributes like wish (iraadah), power (qudrah), hearing (sam') and seeing (basr) which are <u>eternal</u> and the created things that they must relate to (the things that are created and have been wished, have come about through power, are seen and heard) which are <u>recent</u>. This must mean that there must be an aspect of recency (huduth) in those attributes that relate to these created things. We don't mean recency as in Allaah acquiring the actual attribute, but in the sense of their relation to created things, having accepted they are eternal. In other words, if Allaah is seeing you right now, this means that Allaah's sight has an element of recency to it, in that He is seeing now what He did not see before the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. And the same goes for explaining how does Allaah's iraadah relate to what has come about through His wish (that which is muraad), and likewise qudrah (power) in relation to what is maqdur. So the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> invented a few terms to patch up this hole, and so they spoke of what they call <b>ta'alluqaat</b> (associations) and <b>muta'allaqaat</b> (the things associated). So let us explain through the example of seeing (basr). There is Allaah's attribute of basr (seeing), which is eternal. There is the thing seen (let's say it is you, right now). How does the attribute of seeing of Allaah (that is eternal) relate to you? Now things are a little deeper here than meets the eye and you have to get into the mind of the kalam theologist and understand what he means by "eternity" since he is conceiving of this in a way different to what is in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah - but that is for another article. The point here is that the particular conception they have is what is forcing them into these types of wranglings. So they say there is an association (ta'alluq) between the attribute of seeing (basr) and between you who is the muta'allaq (the thing associated). So we have three things, the eternal attribute, the ta'alluq (association) and the muta'allaq (you, the associated thing). And in this manner they are trying to distance themselves from the necessity of having the element of huduth (recency) into the attributes they affirm as eternal attributes. They are doing this by putting a "buffer zone" in between the attribute and recent, created things, and this buffer zone is through these words, to allow the illusion of a connection or relation. <b>Now in reality</b>, all of this just pure waffle and is pure word games. All they have done is created <u>an imaginary thing</u> called ta'alluq (an association) and pretended they have solved the problem when they haven't. So either they say that this ta'alluq is <i>wujoodi</i> (i.e. existent, real) in which case they have affirmed a contemporaneous connection between Allaah's sight and what He is seeing right now, or what He is wishing right now, or subjecting to His power right now, which would then mean huduth (recency) and that would then undermined their entire theology and make it collapse on itself. Or they say that this ta'alluq is 'adami (non-existent, intangible) which is what they are really saying, trying to make it look as if there is something of <a href='../tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, but there is no actual connection between the eternal attribute and the thing it is supposed to relate to right now, it is just an illusion of connection through mere words. Now this same problem exists for the attributes of iraadah, and likewise qudrah, and qudrah (power) in particular poses a big problem for them, and this we can address in a separate article as we do not wish to go into a tangent here. The aim is just to get across the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> position and their way of dealing with the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'lyyah (tied to Allaah's choice) and those particular attributes from the seven (like wish, hearing, seeing, power) that must have things they relate to from the creation.    <P>
Now that this is clear we are in a position to understand al-Kashmiri's Maturidi counterpunch, and it is a nice little uppercut to be honest, but he is not the first to refute them on this, and he was preceded in this by <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> centuries earlier. Remember, the Maturidis hold that all of Allaah's <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> [both those which are transitive like ihyaa' (giving life), imaatah (taking life), tazreeq (sustaining) and likewise love, pleasure, anger] all come under a single eternal attribute called al-takwin and therefore they are not considered "hawaadith" to the Maturidis. But the Maturidis do agree with the Ash'aris in certain actions that are exceptions (like <a href='../tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and al-nuzul), as has preceded. So al-Kashmiri's counter to the Ash'aris is that you claim that wish (iraadah) and power (qudrah) that are eternal have a ta'alluq (association) with created, originated things (hawaadith), yet you do not argue thereby that Allaah's wish and power are therefore originated. His intent here is to rebuke the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> for not claiming that wish and power are <i>hawaadith</i>, external to Allaah's essence, just like they claim that the <i>sifaat fi'lyyah</i> are <i>hawaadith</i> and external to Allaah's essence, meaning created. He says that it is known amongst the Mutakallimeen that the ta'alluqaat (pay attention here), <u>the associations</u> (that sit in between the attribute and the created thing [muta'allaq] it relates to) are actually hawaadith. Meaning the associations [ta'alluqaat] themselves have to be hawaadith. This would mean, upon the principle they all adhere to as part of the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>, that <i>whatever is not devoid of hawaadith is itself haadith</i>, that these attributes of Allaah (like power, wish, hearing, seeing) must be <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated, as in created, to them). Then he says that the smart and shrewd ones amongst them began to say that <u>the sifah (attribute) and the ta'alluq (association) are eternal</u> (pay attention here) and only the muta'allaq (the thing associated, meaning the created thing) is of recent occurrence, meaning originated, created. And again, this is just another level of sophistry in fleeing from what is plain and obvious in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power (something they can't reconcile with their proof).    <P>
The point here is that the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have a very weak position and all they have is waffle, pure imaginary things that have no reality to them, and mere word play as a means to deal with a problem they are faced with based upon the way they tried to reconcile some of the attributes and all of the actions with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. <b>However, at the same time</b>, the Maturidi position (all actions come under al-takween which is eternal) is also falsehood, its just another way of trying to achieve the same goal and objective of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='../tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> all of whom were trying to abide by the principle "<i>Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith (events) is itself <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated)</i>" in order to validate and complete the proof of huduth al-ajsaam and reconcile the revealed texts with it. As we stated in our series on <b>the Slander of <a href='../tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah</b> (<a href=../series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>see here</a>), all of the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups are united upon a certain basic framework. Their differences with each other are only subsidiary differences related to how to patch up that framework and keep it together. In the process some of them were led to <b><a href='../tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a></b> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) to varying degrees, and others were led to <b><a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></b> (Raafidah, Hanafi Karraamiyyah)</blockquote>    <P>
This brings us to the end of this quote from al-Kashmiri and our comments. As there is a lot in this article it is important we summarize the important lessons we can take away from it.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes and Lessons</font>    <P>
So these are the most important things you should take away from this article:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first:</b> Distinguishing between those showing  honesty, justice and genuine scholarship (even if we consider them to be upon error in their orientation broadly speaking) from that <u>breed of conniving dishonest Jahmite</u> that unfortunately reared its ugly head in the 20th century and which unfortunately dominates todays polemic against the followers of the righteous Salaf and whose offspring are found in abundance on the blogs, forums and websites. We are talking here about the collection of swindlers, shysters, fraudsters, be those with calculated intent, or the deluded clueless ignorant who follow them. Here is what we mean (only by way of example):    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>People like Zubair, (see <a href=../index4606.html?nlpdj>this article</a> and the entire series that follows) <a href='../tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=../indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='../tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="../tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=../indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=../indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=../indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='../tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=../index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='../tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=../index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, <a href=../indexc0a0.html?fmima>here</a>, <a href=../index3c1b.html?pbtfl>here</a> and <a href=../indexa72a.html?hsgze>here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=../index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=../index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
And likewise the various so called "Sunni" forums, the Marifahs and the Asleins and others where these clueless people hang out, the blind leading the blind, where mass confusion, and ignorance of their own creed, let alone that of their opponents, is the rule of thumb.     <P>
    <P>
<b>The second:</b> Al-Kashmiri's corroboration of what is correct in the language that what is <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (of recent occurrence) is not necessarily what is makhluq (created), and that an action (fi'l) is what <u>one is described with (muttasif)</u> not something <u>one is said to have created</u> in his own essence. Thus, Allaah's <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> or his <i><a href='../tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i> are things Allaah is described with when they are established with His essence, and it is not said Allaah "creates" them in His essence.    <P>
<b>The third:</b> Al-Kashmiri attributes this viewpoint to Imaam al-Bukhari (of distinguishing between what is <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> and  makhluq), and we have a separate article on that, and in particular his observation that the explainers of the Sahih tried to make <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of al-Bukhari's view.    <P>
<b>The fourth:</b> Al-Kashmiri also explains this as the view of <a href='../tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad bin Hasan, through the issue of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
<b>The fifth:</b> Al-Kashmiri makes a clarification (distinction) about what is said to be the tafweed of the Salaf in that he says their way is to take the text upon its dhaahir, without <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, and to make tafweed of its tafseel (detail) and how it is (<a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>). This appears to be in agreement with what Ahl al-Sunnah say that the way of the Salaf is tafweed of <u>the kaifiyyah and haqiqah</u>, and not <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of <u>the ma'naa</u> (meaning). However, being a Maturidi, it is likely that by "tafseel" he actually means "ma'naa." The battle between the Salaf and the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> was a battle of meanings, and not over the mere existence of words in the revealed texts. The <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their offshoots accused the Salaf of being <a href='../tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> because they affirmed the meanings, and the Salaf clarified that affirmation of the meanings are not <a href='../tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, rather resemblance of the realities (of Allaah's attributes and actions) to those of the creation is what comprises <a href='../tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>.     <P>
<b>The sixth:</b> His response (from a Maturidi) perspective to  the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> treatment of the <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> who say they are created things (hawaadith) not established with Allaah's essence, whereas the Maturidis include them within al-takwin as eternal attributes.  </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To follow in <b><a href=../indexda56.html?mbeif>Part 2</a></b>, al-Kashmiri's comments on al-Bukhari's Sahih that are related to this particular subject.</div>    <P>
