<blockquote>This is an extremely important and monumental piece of historical record which fits into the larger jigsaw puzzle which  as it continues to be solved further exposes the academic fraud of today's <b><a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a></b> posing as "Asha'ris." What is known <u>today</u> as "<a href="../tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" is a confused medley of both historical and academic frauds bundled together to produce a school of doctrine that is in essence <u>one big lie</u>, at least in its ascription to what <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself died upon, since those who ascribed to <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> wandered away from what he was upon of the school of <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, let alone what he tended to at the end of his life, that which <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was upon, the Imaam of Ahl al-Sunnah.     <P>
Often we are forced to use metaphors and colorful language so that the reader can <u>truly appreciate</u> the significance of what they are reading, so what this article represents is <u>another Hiroshima</u> under the seat of contemporary <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> polemics against the Sunni Muslims, who are the Salafis, Atharis, followers of the Sunnah and Jamaa'ah who hold  on to the pure milk of revelation and shun the dung, puss and blood of the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians, <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> which entered the Ummah and was carried by the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Rafidi Hishamiyyah, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah.     <P>
<b>So what is our issue here in this article? First you must have some good background into this matter to appreciate it properly. We suggest you read <a href=../index6d7d.html?ynxqc>this article</a> as a basic primer and it should set the scene for you nicely. Please do not proceed unless you have read the above article. It is also advisable that to truly appreciate the significance of this article and its ramifications, that you read <a href=../series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>our series</a> on the slanderous allegation of <a href='../tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> against Ahl al-Sunnah which has a detailed treatment of the <a href='../tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> that entered the Ummah and the heretical groups it was carried by. Then, these two articles (<a href=../index1d7c.html?qcsxk>this one</a> and the follow up to it, <a href=../indexdc8f.html?sudai>this one</a>) are absolutely crucial if you want insight into what is going on, they deal with how the kalam groups explain the origin of the universe and Allaah's actions.</b>    <P>
<u>In a nutshell</u>, when the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (conceptual language and tools) of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> entered the Ummah - [the discussion of divinity through the language of "bodies" and accidents" (<i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>) is the refuse and trash of other nations who abandoned their revealed books and turned to the language of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> which was taken to be "the great science of the day"] - it led the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to deny all names (<i><a href='../tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a></i>) and attributes (<i><a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></i>) and actions (<i>af'aal</i>) to avoid likening Allaah to a body (<i><a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>) [upon their innovated definitions of jism]. The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, taking this from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, denied all attributes and actions. The <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> referred to all <u>attributes</u> and <u>actions</u> as <i><a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (non-permanent incidental attributes) without distinguishing between them. Then in the third century, a new faction appeared who debated with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> using the same <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (and not the Book and the Sunnah), but they were unable to refute the doubts of the Mu'tazilaah pertaining to Allaah's speech, because they, unlike the Imaams of the Sunnah, were not really grounded in the sunnah and aathaar. So whilst they managed to find a way to affirm Allaah's attributes, albeit, upon an innovated way, they could not refute the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on Allah having actions  tied to His will and power. This manifested mainly in the issue of Allaah's speech (<a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) where the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> overempowered them, and forced them to acknowledge that if successive speech is affirmed for Allaah, it signifies hawaadith (events) in His essence, thus rendering Him a created body like all the created bodies. The <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> affirmed attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and denied they were <i><a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> for Allaah and they dealt with the attribute of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) in a certain way by innovating a definition that <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is only a meaning in the self (<i><a href='../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>), and they rejected Allaah's chosen actions (af'aal) because it entailed, in their view, hawaadith (events) in Allaah's essence, which according to Aristotelian conceptual language (that all <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups were operating upon as the platform of debate), would render Him a body. As a result, they were forced to say there are two Qur'ans, one which is a meaning in the self of Allaah and the other which is created, which is what we have, in letter and word. So in essence they agreed with the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality about the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created, but they innovated a false definition of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) which they tried to attribute to Allaah so as to please both the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
<b>This manner of speaking about Allaah and his attributes was the new <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, the innovated <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> not known or spoken of by any Prophet or Messenger, and they put the Ummah to trial with this, and the Salaf's rejection of them was extremely severe as is well known and documented. This is what was condemned by Imaam Maalik and Imaam al-Shaafi'ee in the second century hijrah, just prior to the emergence of the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> in the third century.</b>    <P>

Imaam Ahmad, following those before him, showed great rejection against the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> who were upon this in the early third-century, those who innovated new principles to support and prop up that intermediate, hybrid creed of something of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and something of Sunnah.     <P>
Then came Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who was a Mu'tazili for forty years of his life before he abandoned them, but he turned to the school of the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and not to the Sunnah. As he moved towards the end of his life, he started to become closer and closer to the Sunnah until he wrote al-Maqaalaat and al-Ibaanah in which he explicitly expressed that he is upon what <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is upon, and his writings became more and more closer to the Sunnah.     <P>
The <a href='../tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> who came (in the fourth century) broadly remained upon what <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was upon, with its Kullaabi influence, but in the fifth-century (400H onwards) others came along ascribing to <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and slowly moved the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> school away from its Kullaabi roots and back towards the views of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. These are the likes of <a href='../tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 403H), <a href='../tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H), <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), and <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H). They denied <a href='../tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, and denied the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Khabariyyah whose affirmation were a hallmark of the Kullabi school initially adopted by <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and by the time <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> had had their time on the field, they had entered philosophy, gnostic illuminism, an innovated tasawwuf and many other affairs which essentially severed any tangible connection with <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and thus, "<a href="../tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" became just a self-lauding slogan and label used by intellectually confused and bewildered people. This continues today in a people who are closer to the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> than they are to <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, let alone to Ahl al-Sunnah.

Some of the later ones, like <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, had enough intelligence to realize that some of these foundations held by the earlier ones were flawed and upon careful inspection can not really hold ground. <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Razi</font></a> has numerous critiques of some of these false and baseless principles. This indicates that today's <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> concealed under the slogan of "<a href="../tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" are munaafiqoon (hypocrites) in the way they behave with Ahl al-Sunnah, we mean here <u>hypocrisy in dealing and behaviour</u>, not hypocrisy in the foundation of belief. This means that they use arguments and polemics against the people of the Sunnah [the Salafis, Atharis, followers of the Imaams of the Sunnah in shunning <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and adhering to the aathaar with tasleem] which they know to be false arguments and which cannot really be sustained which have been annihilated by some of their own figureheads centuries ago. As we have said repeatedly, "Ash'arism" is one big academic fraud, an intellectual con. The reason why they have gotten away with it for so long is purely because to unravel their fraud requires detailed and lengthy investigation, and a detailed study of history, and a detailed knowledge of their various positions in different areas of creed (in which there are many internal and blatant contradictions) and this knowledge is not yet common knowledge to the average person (or even the average Ash'ari), and only when it is common knowledge will their fraud collapse in no time.    <P>
In short, the Kullaabi, <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school was characterized by affirming attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) for Allaah in principle (including <i><a href='../tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a></i> and the <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i> such as face, hands, eyes) whilst rebutting the claim of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that these attributes are <i><a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (non-permanent, incidental attributes), or that they necessitate <a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and the same time rebutting the <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. However, they denied the <i><a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> (actions tied to Allaah's will and power such as speaking as and when He wills, and <a href='../tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, al-nuzool, mahabbah, <a href='../tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a> and the likes) upon the  argument that these are hawaadith (events) - so they inherited and retained something of the usool of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> upon which they built their doctrinal school. This principle (of rejecting Allaah's chosen actions upon the argument that they are "hawaadith" and necessitate tajseem) is utterly false and known as such through naql (revelation) and aql (reason). Moving on now, this brings is now to the main piece in our article. Please read it with care and reflection.    <P>

The excerpt below is from <i>Al-Mataalib al-Aaliyyah</i> of al-Raazee (ed. al-Saqaa, Dar al-Kitaab al-Arabi, 2/106), and it is said to be one of the later books of <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>.    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-2-105.gif align=right border=1 border=0>   <font class='titleHeadline'>The Fifteenth Chapter in Clarifying That His Being a Repository (Mahall) For Other Than Him is Impossible</font>    <P>
There are numerous (areas) of investigation (regarding this matter which have taken place by various factions):    <P>
<b>The first study:</b> Whether it can be understood that He is a repository for hawaadith (events). They said: This is a saying that has not been spoken of by anyone except the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. And I (al-Raazee) say: This is a saying that has been said by the majority of the leaders of the various schools of doctrine.    <P>
<u>As for the Ash'ariyyah:</u> They claim to flee from this saying but it is binding upon them from various angles:    <P>
<b>The first:</b> That He the Exalted is able to bring into existence a particular body (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) from past eternity to future eternity. When He creates that particular body, it becomes impossible for it to be said: He still remains able to bring it into existence, because now to bring it into existence is impossible [it is already in existence], and that which is impossible cannot have any [exercise of power] over it. Hence, the connection of His ability (qaadiriyyah) to bring that body into existence has ceased and expired.    <P>
<b>And the second:</b> That it is impossible for it to be said in past eternity that He used to request from Zaid the establishment of the prayer and giving of Zakah in the present [because Zayd never existed]. Then when Zayd came into existence He began requesting him to establish the prayer in the present and to give the zakah. This request (talb) is an enjoinment and an occurring enjoinment is that which was taking place [requesting Zayd] and then completed and fully taken place [having requested from Zayd], and this necessitates the occurrence of a [new] attribute in the essence of Allaah, the Exalted. And if someone was to say: He being one who [in eternity] requested Zayd in the present to establish the prayer is a [case of a] specific connection (ta'alluq) and a specific relationship (nisbah) [between that which is eternal and that is current, present], and is not [treated as an issue of] attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>). We say: These connections and relationships [you are claiming], do they have an actual [true and real] existence or is not the case [that they do]? The second [situation] (that there is not true and real existence to these claimed "connections" and "relationships") requires negation  of Him, the Exalted, being one who requests the establishment of the prayer and giving of zakah in the present. And as for the first (that these alleged "connections" and "relationships" are true and real and actually exist), then it requires the occurrence of a [new] attribute in Allaah's essence.    <P>
<b>And the third:</b> Which is that it is impossible that He, the Exalted, hears the <a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> of Zayd before his existence and that He sees the form of Zayd before its existence. Thus, Him being one who listens to that <a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, this only occurred at the occurrence of that <a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, and His seeing that form [of Zaydd] only occurred at the occurrence of that form, and this requires the occurrence of these [new attributes] in the essence of Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
<b>And as for the Mu'tazilah:</b> Then Abu Alee and Abu Haashim adopted the view that the attribute of desiring (mureediyyah) and ennobling (kiraamiyyah) take place in His essence and that something new arises in His essence in that He is hearing and seeing these newly-occuring voices and newly-occuring colors. And as for Abu al-Husayn al-Basri, he has explicitly announced that the knowledge of Allaah changes with the change in the [detail] of that which is known [from His creation], and that those [types of] knowledge [that relate to the change in circumstances of what is in His creation] are newly-arising in the essence of Allaah.    <P>
<b>And as for the Philosophers:</b> Then alongside them being the furthest of people from this madhhab (doctrine), they have in fact spoken of it without them realizing it, and its explanation is: That to them these additional descriptions (idaafaat) are [considered to be] attributes existing within actual entities, and there is no doubt that the Creator, the Exalted, is present alongside every newly-occuring thing that enters into existence. And there is no doubt that He was present before the occurrence of that newly-arising thing, and He  shall remain present after the perishing of that newly-arising thing. And this "before", "with", and "after" (i.e. idaafaat) are newly-arising annexations (descriptions) in the essence of Allaah, the Exalted. And when these annexations are [treated as] existing things in actual entities, then this is tantamount to speaking with the occurrence of [new] attributes and meanings, in the essence of Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
So by this study, that which we mentioned is established (namely): That the saying of the occurence of attributes in the essence of Allaah is a saying which all factions speak with (in reality).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Commentary and Explanation</font>    <P>
<blockquote>  <b>POINT 1: Terminology.</b> First, an issue to do with terminology. <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Razi</font></a> speaks of "<i>huduth al-sifaat</i>" (emergence of attributes), and this is a misleading statement, since in the context of the discussion, it merges together both attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) into one term. The saying that Allaah acquires attributes He never had before is a false saying, such as that Allaah became one who speaks and acts whilst previously not being like that, or acquired qudrah (power) and so on. But that Allaah chooses to speak and act as and when He wills, with such speech and action that He never spoke or acted before, alongside Him eternally being one who speaks and acts, it is not correct to refer to this as "huduth al-sifaat" (since Allaah always had speech and action, yet it is tied to His will and power, He chooses to speak and act as and when He wills), these are simply Allaah's <i><a href='../tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i> (chosen actions) which are sign of His utmost perfection.     <P>
<b>NOTE:</b> This (Allaah's chosen actions) is the point of contention and <u>the battlefield of war</u> between the followers of the revealed Books, the sent Messengers, the followers of the Righteous Salaf of the first three centuries, the Salafis, Atharis, Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, receiving the pure "unadulterated milk" of revelation and between the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidi <a href='../tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a> and Maaturidiyyah, those who opted for the dung, puss and blood of the refuse of the previous nations from the Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, who already preceded them in speaking about Allaah, His Names and Attributes upon the language and terminology of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> (bodies and incidental attributes). And the victorious are those who are with the Book and the Sunnah and the Aathaar, and there is nothing more detestable to the diseased and poisoned <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> innovator than what is necessitated by the revealed texts of the annihilation of his falsehood, such as the saying of Allaah, the Exalted:     <P>

For this reason, in the written and spoken polemics of these people you will hardly find them mentioning a verse or a narration. It is all just rhetoric and kalam and speech about Allaah upon speculation and the Aristotelian conceptual tools upon which they were forced to base their speech about Allaah when they accepted them as a platform of debate against the Atheists and <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
<b>POINT 2: The <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>.</b> <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> first mentions what all the schools of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> say about the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> sect, that the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> affirm "<i>hawaadith</i>" in Allaah's essence, but what is being referred to here is acquisition of attributes in Allaah's essence.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The Karaamiyyah</b> are brethren to the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and others in <a href='../tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. All these groups founded their creed upon a demonstration of a proof for the universe being originated called "huduth al-ajsaam" except that they all had different ways of trying to validate its basic foundations. The greatest underlying foundation was what <a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> laid down, "<i>the impossibility of an endless chain of events</i>."  Since events, are ultimately tied to Allaah's actions (since Allaah's actions bring about events), then this principle demands that it be said that speech and action was impossible for Allaah for a period in eternity, and then it became possible for Him (when the creation was created). From this point, the various <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups differ as to how they treat the issue of Allah's speech (<a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and action (fi'l) which led to the creation of the creation. But the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> had a unique approach in trying to remain true to al-Jahm bin Safwan's foundational premise, "<i>the impossibility of an endless chain of events</i>," so they said that Allaah was not always one who speaks and acts, but He acquired these attributes after not having them. They said this because if Allaah was eternally one who speaks and acts (according to His will, choice and power) it would mean and endless chain of events in the past, and this would clash with the basic premise they were using to argue the universe is originated. But this view necessitates that Allaah was decifient, lacking certain attributes, but then acquired them, and this is what is referred to as "<i>huduth al-sifaat</i>" (emergence of new attributes). So applying this label to the position of the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <i>huduth al-sifaat</i>, is correct and appropriate.  The Karraami explanation was an alternative way to that of the  <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> of trying to achieve the same goal, for what they held is that though Allaah eternally had attributes their manifestation of was impossible (mumtani') for a period in eternity but then became possible (mumkin). So they have an eternal void period prior to the creation of the creation, and in this manner they avoid affirming an endless chain of events.</div>    <P>
In short, the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, in trying to validate their <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology, held that Allaah acquired new attributes and this is a baatil (futile) saying which implies deficiency for Allaah.     <P>
<b>POINT 3: Evidences Against the Ash'arites</b> Then <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> says that the Ash'aris claim to flee from this saying, except that it is binding upon them to speak with this too. He brings three evidences for this.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Before we explain these evidences, you have to remember that these people (having agreed to use the terminology and conceptual tools of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> as the platform of debate) were forced to characterize their theology with that very same language. You don't jump in water and then claim you can come out without getting wet! But that is what happened to these people who delvedd into <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and you will understand  the sayings of the Imaams of the Salaf such as "No one entered <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and prospered" and what is similar to that. So the end result was that just like Aristotle's God, they ended up with a God that was static, frozen, unable to speak, unable to act, an abstract entity, having no true and real relationship with His creation because any actual relationship would signify "<i>hawaadith</i>" to them (in Aristotles language). In other words, if He spoke with a specific speech He never spoke with before, this has somehow signified "change" in His essence, which signifies deficiency. Whilst they disagreed with the views of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> on the eternity of the universe, they nevertheless converged with these <a href='../tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="../tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> in the actual theological language used to describe Allaah. Thus Aristotle's immutable, abstract, remote, static, frozen deity, became the deity of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah. It is for this reason they deny Allaah's <a href='../tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, that He loves, becomes pleased, becomes angry, that He speaks as and when He wills (hence the Kullaabi, <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> innovated doctrine of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee), because all of these apparently signify change (<i>taghyeer</i>) and are events (<i>hawaadith</i>). </div>    <P>
So <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> here is bringing some evidences that you cannot maintain this position of apparently negating "hawaadith" (events), because you are in fact forced to affirm them, and there is no escape from  this. So these are his evidences, simplified:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first:</b> Let's say that before creating the Pen, we are able say that Allaah has the power to create the Pen , that He is able to bring such a thing into existence from past eternity. Now when He actually created the Pen, it is impossible for it to be said any longer that Allaah is still able to bring it into existence, because it is already in existence, so this is an impossibililty, and power cannot be exercised over that which is an impossibility, and hence the connection of that power and ability of Allaah we spoke of prior to the creation of the pen, to the actual creation of the pen has now expired. So this means that the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have to affirm that the "circumstances" have changed so to speak, this is what <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> is getting across.    <P>
<b>The second:</b> It is not possible for Allaah to have requested in eternity a non-existent Zayd to fulfil the obligation of prayer and zakat in the present (as in now) - since Zayd did not exist then. Requesting something is to make something binding and to make something binding is something that occurs and completes, and this necessitates  in al-Razi's terminology, huduth al-sifah, a new attribute in Allaah's essence. To hold that Allaah is eternally requesting Zayd to fulfil the obligation of prayer and zakat, before the creation of Zayd and after Zayd perishes is absurd and opposes naql (revealed text) and aql (sound reason).    <P>
<b>The Third:</b> It is impossible for Allaah to have heard the <a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> of Zayd or the form of Zayd before he was created. Allaah hearing that <a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> or seeing Zayd was only when Zayd spoke or when he came into existence with a form. This necessitates huduth (something new, recent) in the essence of Allaah according to <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>. To put it another way, whatever you are doing right now, did Allaah see you in your bodily form doing it in eternity? If so, that would mean you are eternal along with Allaah's attributes. The answer is no, Allaah is seeing you and your actual form (body with soul) and hearing you (<a href='../tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>) right now, as you exist, but this was not the case before Allah brought you into existence with an actual form.</blockquote>    <P>
The <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of course have no answer to these questions and all they did (and continue to do) was to play word games, and that really is the essence of the <a href='../tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> (<a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) school. It is all about playing with words and definitions to wriggle out of difficulties. So what the <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (<a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>) did was to say that hearing (sam') and seeing (basr) are really knowledge (ilm), when Allaah hears, it means He knows and when He sees, it means He knows. And in this way, the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are actually forced to deny Allaah has actual hearing (by which He hears His creation) and actual seeing (by which He sees His creation) - otherwise the argument above is binding upon them, and they are forced to acknowledge that the foundation of their madhhab and creed is laid to waste, in ruins, in utter annihilation, and the game is over and done with. This is what we find the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> tending to, explaining away hearing and seeing to mean knowledge, because the implication finally sank into their confused brains (which were roasted and toasted by that ilm-kalaam), after many centuries.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary and Closing Note</font>    <P>
Ash'arism (and Maturidism) and kalam theology in general is just a propped up incoherent academic fraud. The "<a href="../tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a>" have to deny all the attributes pretty much, except life (hayaat) (which is laazim). As for hearing and seeing (these are muta'addi), they must deny them because they imply huduth (Allaah hearing and seeing things that are recent), and likewise iraadah and qudrah (Allaah willing and exercising power over things which are of recent occurrence) and Allah's knowledge (prior to Zayd dying it is in Allaah's knowledge that <u>Zayd is living</u> and <u>will die</u> at an appointed time, and when Zayd has died, it is in Allaah's knowledge that <u>Zayd was living</u>, <u>has died</u> and died <u>at the appointed time</u>). These <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> wish to escape from the deity of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and seek refuge instead in the deity of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, an abstract, static, frozen deity, unable to actually hear, actually see, actually speak, or act.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> cannot escape from reality and must become <u>full men</u> by either joining the men of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and thus deny all attributes upon a uniform, consistent principle or by joining the men of Ahl al-Sunnah, the Salafis, Atharis and affirm all attributes upon a uniform consistent principle, instead of remaining effeminate sissies (<i>makhaaneeth</i>), stuck in the middle, being of unbalanced mental constitution, confused, bewildered, and tossed in every wave of blatant contradiction and hypocrisy. </b></div>    <P>
