<div align=center><img src=../assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0></div>    <P>
<u>Note:</u> <b>Part 4</b> (this article) and <b><a href=../indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5</a></b> constitute <u>one whole article</u> and should be read together. It would be a very good idea to read <b><a href=../index81d7.html?mwbop>Part 1</a></b> as it is good background for this material.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In <a href=../index81d7.html?mwbop>Part 1</a>, we gave a brief historical account of the origins of the theology of the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Mutakallimin) and  established that what we have in ther theological language is simply a belief in God characterized through <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> and that this conceptual baggage came to the Mutakallimin through the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who were present in the Muslim lands and from whom it entered the Muslims.  In <a href=../index0e7c.html?dktlu>Part 2</a>, we looked at two "<u>fundamental principles</u>" that <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> claimed and we exposed how fundamentally and principally, <u>they are both stolen from Aristotle</u>, whose language of <a href='../tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> is the foundation of the Mutakallimun in speaking about Allaah. In <a href=../index06f1.html?bresw>Part 3</a>, we addressed a very cheap slander attempted by <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> in his claim that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> declares Allaah to a be a body (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) with a shape, with his full knowledge that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> rejects Aristotelian Metaphysical terminology in speech about Allaah, and this is known and famous in all his books, and for which ignorance cannot be an excuse any longer. He tried to make use of an obscure, complex passage in which <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> was critiquing the views of <a href='../tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (a kalam influenced Hanbali) in the latter's attempts to reconcile between Imaam Ahmad's affirmation and negation of "hadd" for Allaah. The wider context of these statements from <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was discussed. We also explained the background to the issue and exonerated <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> from the huckster's peddlery, and the falsehood of this accusation became self-evident.</div>    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ibnt-philosophers-comp1.gif hspace=5 vspace=3 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>The Issue of Tasalsul al-Af'aal and Tasalsul al-Aathaar (Infinite Regress or Endless Chain of Actions and Effects) And Its Connection to the Issue of <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, Attributes and Actions and the Theology of the Kalam Innovators</font>    <P>
In <a href=../index06f1.html?bresw>Part 3</a> we started looking at the first point of comparison by <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> and we mentioned that three issues were incorporated within it, a) whether <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> believes and states "<i>Allaah is a <a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>" b) the citation <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> made to make this allegation against <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, (<a href=../index06f1.html?bresw>these two were dealt with here</a>). In this article we will address the third issue raised in the first point of comparison, which is indicated in the diagram to the right.    <P>
This third issue in reality cannot be done justice in a single article like this, and would even need multiple series of articles because there are lots of background issues one has to be familiar with and the stances of each faction (the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the Mutakallimun), Ahl al-Sunnah) in order to grasp what is going on. Just the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (kalam cosmological argument) which became the subject of contention between the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Mutakallimun in the arguments about the origination or eternity of matter would take numerous articles to cover in depth. But, in order to clear this doubt regarding <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ahl al-Sunnah (because the view of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is also the view of the Imaams of the Salaf), we will attempt our best to concisely present the issue in as clear as manner as possible, by Allaah's permission.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Nature of the Claim</font>    <P>
The claim is that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> affirms something eternal besides Allaah which is eternal in its existence with Allaah, and that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> agrees with the sayings of the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (that matter is eternal and has no beginning). This is patently false as we shall see and is a gross misrepresentation of the nature and conception of the issue itself. A problem we have in the discussion of this matter in English is that there are many terms poorly translated with expressions incapable of presenting the depth and clarity of meaning in the Arabic, and they are left unexplained to the audience. Al-Naruiij's writings are plagued with these deficiencies and these expressions (in Arabic) need to be grasped and understood in the wider context of the debate between the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who claimed matter is eternal and the Mutakallimun who used weak arguments to refute them, and the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah who refuted the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> through the harmonious combination of naql (revealed text) and aql (reason). As an example, expression such as (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1606;&#1608;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1604;</span>), and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1593;&#1604; &#1605;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1583;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1608;&#1593;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1583;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606;</span>) not only need proper representation but can never be isolated from what each faction holds as their underlying principles and preliminary assumptions or beliefs. So our aim is to give a proper representation of the facts and through this expose the intellectual and academic fraud of <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>. This is what <a href='../tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> said (in characterizing Ibn Taymiyyah's position):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>...and that there have always been other bodies with Him, coming into existence, one after another eternally without a beginning.[1] Accordingly, there is one eternal body, while other bodies are eternal in kind in his view.</blockquote>    <P>
As for the claim that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> claims Allaah is "<i>body</i>" (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) this has been demolished in <a href=../index06f1.html?bresw>Part 3</a>, it is a very cheap slander and shows the level of academic integrity of these people, and exposes their insincere intentions from the outset. As for the issue at hand, then the way it has been presented by al-Naruiji' leaves the reader upon a superficial understanding of a complex issue. When this is the case, it is easy to misrepresent a particular viewpoint, having the assurance that most people are not going to understand it anyway, and the accusation is going to stick. This is what is going on here in this topic. So we will try to demystify this matter as concisely and clearly as possible, with Allaah's permission, so we say:    <P>
<blockquote>  <font class='titleHeadline'>The Various Factions Explained</font>    <P>
First we have <u><b>the Mutakallimun</b></u> (<a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>), these are people who used the conceptual baggage (tools and terminology) of the Greeks and Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) to philosophically defend Islam, as they claimed, and whilst they claimed they were using "<i>pure reason</i>", it was not "<i>pure reason</i>", it was wholesale adoption of the <a href='../tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> which permeated into their actual theology, and this is just like when you jump into water, you are never going to come out dry, as only a fool thinks that. There are many factions, but the mother-group is the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. Its offshoots (as in those who spoke about Allaah's attributes and actions upon the foundations of the Jahmiyyah) are the <u><a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, the <u>Rafidi Hishamiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Salimiyyah</u>, the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>. All of these groups without exception were intended and were the target of the severe scorn, rebuke and rejection made by the Salaf and the Imaams of Ahl al-Sunnah of the blameworthy "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", this was the <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they were speaking about, those who were debating and speaking about <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions using this language and conceptual baggage. <i>This is absolute, undeniable, historical fact</i>.    <P>
Then there are <u><b>the Mutafalsifah</b></u> (al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Ibn Sina), these people tried to merge Greek Philosophy with Shariah texts, and contention arose between them and the Mutakallimun on a number of matters, is the universe eternal or originated, is bodily resurrection possible, and what is the nature of prophethood and how is it known. When the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> started debating in these issues upon philosophy and reason, and employed weak, baseless, pathetic arguments (founded upon the language and conceptual baggage of Aristotelian metaphysics), and then they ascribed it to the Book of Allaah, it  led those people like <a href='../tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, (when they saw the flaws in the evidences used by the Mutakallimun) to reject it and to argue their case for the universe being eternal, that bodily resurrection cannot take place and that prophethood is simply acquired through the possession or development of certain exceptional qualities and faculties.    <P>
Despite these areas of contention, because the Mutakallimun were using the conceptual baggage of the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (mostly Aristotelian Metaphysics), the two parties <u>converged</u> in how they described Allaah. The Mutakallimun were forced into this for two reasons: <u>a)</u> They used the conceptual tools of the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and were therefore bound by it (you don't jump in water without getting wet, stupid) and <u>b)</u> more importantly, they borrowed and refined a proof that originated with the Sabean <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<a href=../index8a9e.html?uwfub >see here</a>) for demonstrating the universe is originated. This is known as huduth al-ajsaam (kalam cosmological argument) and the Sabean <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> had already outlined this proof, and it is as follows (<a href=../index8a9e.html?uwfub >see here</a> for documentation of this quote):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The world has a cause who has never ceased to be, who is one, not manifold, who cannot be described by means of attributes which apply to the things caused.</blockquote>    <P>
Something similar is also mentioned by Ibn al-Nadim in al-Fihrist, he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And their saying that All&#257;h is one (w&#257;hid), no attribute (sifah) is incumbent upon Him and no binding predicate is permitted to (be said of) Him and no syllogisms can be imposed upon Him , as occurs in [the book of Aristotle] <a href='../tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>...</blockquote>    <P>
Refer to Ibn an-Nad&#299;m, <i>Al-Fihrist</i>, Section nine, part one, '<b>A Description of the Chaldean Harranians Known as the Sabeans</b>.' Al-Fihrist was translated into English by Bayard Dodge in two volumes (London, 1969).    <P>
This proof essentially argues that the presence of properties, attributes in whatever is observed is proof that it is originated. And hence, the one who originated them all, must be devoid of properties, attributes (and likewise actions). When this proof entered the Ummah and was spoken of, in its basic crude form, by al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, it was the foundation for the denial of certain core symbols of Islamic belief, from them that Allaah is above His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter, that Allaah took Ibrahim as His khaleel, that Allaah is one who speaks and acts as and when He wills (because all of these represent properties, or attributes and actions that are found only in the things caused). And it was on account of this proof that the saying of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created came about. The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took this from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and they began to refine this proof to make it tighter by adding new elements to it (<a href='../tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>), and then this passed on to the various other <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups, the Rafidi  Hishamiyyah, the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the Saalimiyah, the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and the Maturidiyyah, and the theology of all of these groups was founded upon this proof and each of them tried to give their own version of demonstrating it and remaining congruent with its necessities. As a result, they denied <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions <u>to varying degrees</u> and also disputed with each other about what must be affirmed or denied in order to remain true to this proof. Further, since the language of this proof was founded upon <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> and the terminology of al-ajsaam (bodies) and al-a'raad (the incidental attributes of bodies), these Mutakallimun began to define their belief in Allaah through this language and departed from the Shariah texts. <b>This was the very  <a href='../tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> that was condemned by the Salaf, the Salaf did not condemn reason or argument or defense of the aqidah, they condemned this particular <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is nothing but philosophy in an Islamic garb in reality, which for circumstantial reasons was referred to with the label of "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>"</b>. So our point here is that the Mutakallimun and the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in light of what has been explained, converged with each other <u>in their language of theology</u> [and we have demonstrated this clearly in earlier parts in this seris], even if debate raged on other issues, the most important of which was the origination of the universe. Now because the Mutakallimun were using a flawed corrupt proof (huduth al-ajsaam), they opened the door for the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to undermine the belief that the universe is originated, and they got embroiled and tangled in centuries of debate and from which they could not escape. This even lead to some of them being confused and professing the statement of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1603;&#1575;&#1601;&#1572; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1583;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), [meaning the evidences for either view (eternity or origination of the universe) are equivalent in strength], when they were unable to resolve the very powerful critiques and observations of the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> which did not allow the Mutakallimin to satisfactorily make their proof come full-circle and show consistency.    <P>
As for the third group, they are <u>the Righteous Salaf</u>, Ahl al-Sunnah, they never delved into this <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and war raged between them and those who were upon it during the first few centuries. And they affirmed that Allaah has names, attributes speech and action and He is eternal with these names, attributes speech and action, and that His speech and action are by His will (mashee'ah, iraadah), choice (ikhtiyaar) and His power (qudrah). This is what is indicated in what is abundantly reported from the Imaams of the Salaf like <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> who said that Allaah has never ceased to be one who speaks if He wills (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1586;&#1604; &#1605;&#1578;&#1603;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575; &#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1588;&#1575;&#1569;</span>). And when <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> came along in the seventh century, seeing the entanglement of the Mutakallimin, he addressed the matter and clarified it and refuted the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and showed their weakness and flawed tools and also annihilated the claimed evidences for the eternity of the universe and showed that all they had were mere mirages and nothing else, and he did this through authentic text (naql saheeh) and sound reason (aql sareeh), which are always harmonious and never in conflict.    <P>
The position of these <u>three factions</u> on <u>Allaah's attributes and actions</u> therefore  have an implication of the issue of the creation of the universe because Allaah's attributes and actions are of course inextricably linked to the matter of creation. And this is what we will look at next.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='../tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> and Mutakallimun on Allaah's Actions</font>    <P>
As we have established in earlier parts in this series the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (Aristotle, Ibn Sina) believe in a God that is abstract, static, "frozen", unable to speak and act through choice (they assert God acts with His essence [dhaat] alone, not through choice, will [ikhtiyaar, mashee'ah], which would make His speech and action to be successive instead of all happening at once in eternity for eternity), and from whom all properties of bodies (attributes, actions) are denied (as the underlying language of theology). This is the notion of God that crept into the theology of the Mutakallimin when they accepted the use of the conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='../tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="../tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> (to demonstrate Allaah's existence), and then the extent to which they were influenced (in denying <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions) varied. <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> was a mechanism invented in order to address those revealed texts that clashed with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, because these texts affirmed <u>attributes</u> and <u>actions</u> for Allaah. The <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> denied all attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) and they lumped them altogether and called them <i><a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes). Then the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and following them, the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, innovated the principle (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1590; &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1576;&#1602;&#1609; &#1586;&#1605;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#1606;</span>) "<i>an incidental attribute does not last two instances of time</i>" by which they desired to distinguish between what the creation is decribed with of attributes and what Allaah is described with of attributes. So they claimed that Allaah is constantly recreating the attributes of every single entity at every undivisible instant of time (the color of your clothing, or the heat of your tea is being created trillions of trillions of times each second, because it immediately expires after its instance of creation). With this innovated false principle, they claimed that they established a difference between the attributes found in creation (which are never permanent but constantly expire and are recreated) and between Allaah's attributes which are permanent, constant, eternal. So the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> affirmed attributes in principle, upon an innovated way, that is. But as for actions (af'aal), they agreed with the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that actions, which they call <i>hawaadith</i> (events) cannot be ascribed to Allaah's essence, because actions by their very reality, are not eternal. So here we see that all of them the <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>,  Maturidiyyah are agreed that actions cannot be ascribed to Allaah, in the sense that Allaah chooses and wills to do actions through iraadah and qudrah and which take place and which are said to be actual actions of Allaah. <b>Why?</b> Because according to the proof of huduth al-ajsaam [bodies are originated because of attributes, events, actions that inhere within them or take place from them], it is impossible for an action to be ascribed to Allaah, for it to be an attribute of His essence. The reason for this is because their proof relies upon a principle which is "<i>an endless chain of events in the past is impossible</i>."  Now, if actions are established with Allah, and Allaah is eternal, then we have established an endless chain of events in the past (because Allaah is therefore one who is eternally one who can act). And if this is the case, this does not allow them to maintain their proof of the origination of bodies (huduth al-ajsaam), because it relies upon the principle of denying an endless chain of events in the past, because they say all created bodies and all causes and events stop at <u>one point in the past</u>, having a single causing agent behind them (and prior to that there was no time, space or matter). It is here now we come to the great dilemma and problem. Because it is the very nature of this proof that action has to be denied for Allaah [because it cannot be claimed that an act is said to be an attribute of His essence otherwise this would make Allaah Himself a body according to the other premises of the proof] then <u>to what is the act of causation attributed to?</u> In other words, what specifically brought about the creation then? It is here that we see the sticky  mess of the Mutakallimun, how they shot themselves in the foot and opened the door for the atheists and materialists to attack Islam and the revealed texts and to argue their case of the eternity of the universe being more sound than what the Mutakallimun were claiming <u>which neither proves a creator nor an originated universe</u> (which is in fact true, the proof of huduth al-ajsaam does neither). So let us now look at what each faction (Philosophers, <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) attribute as <u>the cause behind matter and the universe</u>. But, before we dive into that, we have to address a couple of related essential matters so that our comprehension is complete when we look at the various sayings and realize how the Mutakallimin just dug themselves into a deeper pit, and <u>the first of them</u> is:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Faa'il (the Doer), al-Fi'l (the Action), al-Ma'ful (That Which is Done)</font>    <P>
When the Mutakallimun tried to prove the universe is created through their proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and all Muslims believe the heavens and earth are originated without doubt, and when all Muslims also believe that Allaah created them after their non-existence, this inevitably means the attribution of the act of "creating" and the action of "creation" to Allaah and that this was established with Allaah's essence as a <i>sifah fi'liyyah</i> (non-permanent attribute of creating), as in an instance of creating, that had not taken place before. But this would mean that something <a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (recent, new) has occurred with Allaah (implying change), and this invalidates the proof (of huduth al-ajsaam) because it means Allaah too is an originated body, upon the necessities of the underlying metaphyscal baggage they accepted as the platform of debate and which came from a star-worshipping idolator and passed through the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='../tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> before it came to these factions after Islaam. It is here that the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) innovated baatil (falsehood) not known to the people of any civilization, nation, culture or language. They said that (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1604; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1601;&#1593;&#1608;&#1604;</span>), which means "<i>the act is synonymous with the result of the act</i>" and this would also mean therefore that (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1604;&#1602; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602;</span>), "<i>[the action of] creation is but the creation itself</i>" and the intent here is to remove the "action" element from "<i>the doer</i>, <i>the action</i>, <i>that which is done</i>", so all we have now, with action removed, is "<i>the doer, <s>the action</s>, that which is done</i>" and no action in between that gave rise to the end-result (that which was done) and which is ascribed to the acting agent. This is how they tried to escape from the inherent flaw in this proof and as you can see, they just went further and further into misguidance, playing with language and all sorts of tomfoolery with the revealed texts. Pay attention to the fact that this issue is not relating to the "how" of Allaah's actions, as in what is the reality of Allaah's actions, since Allaah's actions are not like the actions of the creation, and we do not know the reality of it, except what Allaah has told us that whenever He wishes a matter, He says to it "Be!" and it is. That is a different matter. Here we are simply speaking about the attribution of all actions and events we see taking place, to Allaah, and affirming they take place through His choice, will and power and are successive.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Imam al-Bukhari Refutes the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Muta'zilah, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah</b>: Imam al-Bukhari refuted this false principle both in his Sahih (in Kitab al-Tawhid) and also in <i>Khalq Af'aal al-Ibaad</i>. We can read here what he says in the latter work:    <P>
<blockquote>As for [distinguishing] the fi&#703;l (action) from the maf&#703;&#363;l (that which is done, the result of an act), then the fi&#703;l is to bring about something (i&#7717;d&#257;th al-shay'), and the maf&#703;&#363;l is the thing brought about (al-&#7717;adath), due to His saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1617;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1590;&#1614;</span>) "<b>He created (khalaqa) the heavens and the earth</b>" (6:73). The heavens and the earth are maf&#703;&#363;lah (the results of action), and every thing besides All&#257;h that is through His ordainment (qa&#7693;&#257;') then it is maf&#703;&#363;l. Thus the creation of the heavens is His act because it is not possible for the heaven to be established by itself without the action of a doer. And the heaven is ascribed to Him (as His creation) due to His action... Similarly, all languages of the creation provide the same understanding without any difference between them. Indeed there is <u>the f&#257;&#703;il (doer)</u>, <u>the fi&#703;l (the action)</u> and <u>the maf&#703;&#363;l (that which is done, the result)</u>, and the fi&#703;l is the attritube [of the f&#257;&#703;il] and the maf&#703;&#363;l is (something) other than him (the f&#257;&#703;il). And the explanation of that is in His,  Most High's saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1571;&#1614;&#1588;&#1618;&#1607;&#1614;&#1583;&#1578;&#1617;&#1615;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1617;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1571;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1590;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1575; &#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1601;&#1615;&#1587;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618;</span>) <b>I (All&#257;h) made them not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth and not (even) their own creation. (18:51)</b>. He did not intend here by "the creation of the heavens", the heavens themselves  for He has distinguished between the action (of creating) the heavens from the (actual) heavens, and thus did He (fa&#703;ala) [meaning create] the whole of the creation. And (likewise) in His saying, "<b>and not (even) their own creation</b>", He has distinguished between the fi&#703;l (action) and the [created] soul(s), and His action did not become the creation itself...And the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> said: The fi&#703;l and maf&#703;&#363;l are the one and same thing...And the people of knowledge said: Creating is the action of All&#257;h. And our actions are created, due to His, the Most High's saying: <b>And whether you keep your talk secret or disclose it, verily, He is the all-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men). Should not He Who has created know? (67:13-14)</b>. Meaning, [what He created] of secret or open speech.  Thus, the  fi&#703;l (action) of All&#257;h is His attribute, and that which is maf&#703;&#363;l is what is besides Him from the creation.   </blockquote>    <P>

And <u>the second</u> of those important related matters we need to understand is that of:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Infinite Regress, Endless Chain (Tasalsul)</font>    <P>
Tasalsul is referred to by the phrases <i>infinite regress</i> or <i>endless chain</i>, and they are divided into four types:    <P>
<ol><li> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1587;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1572;&#1579;&#1585;&#1610;&#1606; &#1571;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1575;&#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1606;</span>) - <b>Endless Chain of Dependent Causative Agents</b>. This means for example, that one creator, needed a creator, and that creator needed a creator too and so on to infinity. This is <u>impossible and false</u>, and it is what is referred to in the hadeeth about a person asking "Who created this?" and "Who created that?" until Satan comes to him and whispers, "Who created Allaah?"    <P>
<li> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1587;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1575;&#1593;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) - <b>Endless Chain of Dependent Causes</b>. This means that an act (cause) of creation has an act (cause) behind it which it depends upon, and that too has an act behind it which it depends upon and so on to infinity. But this means that no act would ever take place, and this is impossible.    <P>
<li> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1587;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1601;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;</span>) - <b>Endless Chain of Actions</b>. This means that there is an endless amount of actions which take place successively (as opposed to occurring once, eternally), and which are not interdependent such that one cannot occur without a previous one causing it.  With respect to Allaah's actions, this is what the Book, the Sunnah and sound reason indicates. And it is <u>obligatory (waajib)</u> that Allaah was never other than this, meaning, He was never one who does not speak and act as and when He wills, such that He later become one who speaks and acts as and when He wills (as is asserted by the Hanafi Karraami Jahmites), on the contrary, He was eternally one who speaks and acts as and when He wills, never being unlike this, and the foundation of this is that His actions arise through His will and power and He has choice, and since He is eternal, there is no beginning or end to the genus of His speech and action.    <P>
<li> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1587;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1579;&#1575;&#1585;</span>)  - <b>Endless Chain of Events, Effects</b>. And this means that there was no event (<a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>) or entity that was brought into existence, except that it is permissible for there to have been one before it, or one to be after it (going back to infinity in the past, or infinity in the future). This is of course tied to the endless chain in actions (af'aal), and this is <u>permissible (jaa'iz)</u>, <u>possible (mumkin)</u>.  </ol>    <P>
So Ahl al-Sunnah deny the first two and affirm the second two, and the second two are denied by the Mutakallimun because by affirming them, they (according to their false presumption) would not be able to prove the universe is originated, since they rely upon <u>the impossibility (imtinaa') of an endless chain of events in the past</u>, for their proof to be valid, in addition to denying chosen actions being established with Allaah's essence. Once you understand this, the various viewpoints of each faction will become more clear.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Example of Infinite Regress (Endless Chain) in the Future</font>    <P>
We can quote two verses to illustrate very nicely, a key central issue around this whole debate and if you grasp it, the matter will become easy to understand and the error of the kalam theologists will be readily apparent. The first is the saying of Allaah, the Exalted about Paradise:    <P>

In these two verses we see that Paradise and its reward, and its provision is eternal (though it had a beginning and was preceded by non-existence). The provision being referred to is referring to food, sustenance. Now, what this means is that <u>the genus of food</u> will be eternal and never expire. But as for individual instances of food, are they eternal? Of course not! So when you eat of a fruit, that one instance of fruit had a beginning, was preceded by non-existence and then expired and is not therefore eternal, but as a genus (collection, group, kind) that type of fruit will never expire, Allaah will always cause it to exist and renew, and likewise with all other rewards in Paradise, their specific instances expire but their genus is always present and it is renewed through Allaah's speech and action, which is also eternal, since Allah never ceases to be one who speaks and acts through His will and power as and when He wills (to bring about things), and all provisions given to the inhabitants of Paradise are from Allaah, they are His actions of providing for His believing servants whom He entered into Paradise. Thus, whilst every specific instance of that particular type of fruit came into being from non-existence, the genus (group) of that fruit will be eternal and never perish.    <P>
Now, to Ahl al-Sunnah there is absolutely <u>no difference</u> between an endless chain of events in the past and an endless chain of events in the future. <b>It is <u>a contradiction</u> to affirm one and deny the other</b>. <a href='../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> denied an endless chain in the past and the future and he was really being consistent, and so he said that Paradise and Hellfire will perish. And <a href='../tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (a head of the Mu'tazilah) claimed the motion of the people of Paradise and Hellfire will stop and they will remain frozen in that state forever. This conclusion was influenced by Aristotle's ideas about bodies and motion, which many of the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> entered into their theology when proving why bodies are said to be, <i>hawaadith</i>, newly-arisen. They used the issue of bodies having the possibility of either motion or rest which they took straight out of Aristotle's <a href='../tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. <b>So the point here then is that since Allaah is eternal with His attributes and He has choice (ikhtiyaar) and He has wish (iraadah) and qudrah (power), and is eternally one who speaks and acts by choice in a successive manner, then we speak of the endless chain of events (arising through Allaah's speech and action) in the past and the future</b>. This is what the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> opposed and they operated upon false premises (an endless chain of events in the past <u>is impossible</u>) in order to demonstrate their rational proof for the universe being originated, which was inherently flawed and which could never, ever be demonstrated without them rejecting Allaah's attributes and actions and gravitating back to an Aritotelian conception of a deity (which by now you should be familiar with from earlier parts in this series).    <P>
This now leads us to how each faction explains:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What Gave Rise to the Universe? - Ahl al-Sunnah</font>    <P>
First let us deal with <b>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah</b>: They say that Allaah is described eternally as "one who speaks and acts according to His will (iraadah, mashee'ah) and power (qudrah)" and this in turn means that they hold the <u>obligation (wujoob)</u> of an endless chain of actions in both the past and the future. And what they mean here is Allaah's actions, since Allaah's actions arise from His will and power, and no specific action of His can be said to be eternal, rather His actions occur, out of choice and are successive. Thus, he wrote the decrees 50,000 years before creating the creation, and before that He had already created the water and <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and then He created the creation, and then He created Angels, the Jinn and the Men, and then He sent Prophets, and Messengers, spoke to some of them, and on the Day of Judgement, He will speak to His servants and Paradise and Hellfire will be eternal and Allaah will never cease to bring about bliss and reward for the inhabitants of Paradise. All of this indicates that Allaah's actions are tied to His will and power and are successive. The proofs for this are many in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah and this is not the place to enumerate and document them. But one of the key proofs is the saying of Allaah:    <P>

We see here iraadah (wish), and speech, and action all mentioned along with their being successive, and this is from the signs of utmost perfection which clashes with the Aristotelian conception of a [static, mute] deity [that is unable to speak, return speech, or act according to choice and wish] which the <a href='../tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were influenced by when they incorporated that Hellenized conceptual baggage in order to prove the universe is originated through the presence of <i><a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (attributes) and <i>hawaadith</i> (occurrences) within the bodies that make up the universe.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Then they began to claim the revealed texts give the presumption of <a href='../tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> to which <u>the hammer of ta'weel</u> must be applied in order to bang them into shape to agree with that Aristotelian description of a diety, and when <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> proved unsatisfactory, and not consistent, <u>the iron wool of tafweed</u> was brought out to finish off the job... and then these people were put to trial by certain statements of the Salaf whose context, intent and background they did not understand and which they dishonestly employed to argue that the texts of the attributes came devoid of meanings...</div>    <P>
But coming back to the issue, from these types of proofs (which the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah are replete with) <b>Tasalsul al-Af'aal</b> (the endless chain of Allaah's actions) as in Allaah never ceased to be one who speaks and acts according to His will and power as and when He wishes is affirmed  as a matter of <u>wujoob (obligation)</u>. Meaning, it cannot be conceived that Allaah was ever unlike this, meaning, that for a period in eternity, He was one who was <u>not described</u> as one who speaks and acts as and when He wills, (as this implies deficiency), and was devoid of the attributes of speech and action. This is upon the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah that Allaah is eternal with His Names and Attributes, never being devoid of them. And as for <b>Tasalasul al-Aathaar</b> (the endless chain of effects), which means that since Allaah has eternally been one who speaks and acts according to His will and power, then an endless chain of events (aathaar, hawaadith), meaning here <i>that which is besides Allaah and which is brought about through His speech and action</i>, is affirmed as a matter of <u>permissibility (jawaaz)</u> or <u>possibility (imkaan)</u>. Please pay careful attention to the terms here. As you can see, this clashes with the assumption of the Mutakallimun that the first that Allaah ever created anything was the heavens and earth, and they need to assert this in order to allow them to argue (using their proof of huduth al-ajsaam) for the origination of the universe and prior to that action (fi'l) was <u>impossible (mumtani')</u>. But this, as we have noted, led them to serious problems and issues.    <P>
Upon what has preceded, the heavens and earth, and all other things besides Allaah were created by Allaah exercising speech and action through His will and power, and every single thing created by Allaah was always preceded by its own non-existence and there is nothing that is eternal alongside Allaah. However, the genus of Allaah's actions are eternal, without any one specific action of His being eternal and the genus of events (brought about through Allaah's action) therefore follow the same principle, which is that the genus of events [following on from Allaah's actions] can also be said to be perpetual  (after having first considered them to be <u>permissible</u> or <u>possible</u>). What we are distinguishing here is between (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1583;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1608;&#1593;</span>), the genus being eternal and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1583;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606;</span>), any particular instance being eternal. The <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> claimed that a particular act of Allaah is eternal supporting their view that the universe is eternal. This differentiation is affirmed by later <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi scholars who agree on this, and from them Muhammad Bakheet al-Mutee'ee (former Muftee of Egypt) in his book "<i>Sullam al-Wusool li Sharh Nihaayt al-Sool</i>", and likewise al-Dawwaani, and <a href='../tags/muhammad-abduh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Abduh</font></a> (a Maturidi) and likewise <a href='../tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="../tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a>, he admitted and acknowledged that every faction is obliged to affirm "<i>hawaadith</i>" and they cannot escape this. Here we wil quote from al-Mutee'ee (Azhari, <a href='../tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Shaykh):    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Bakheet al-Mutee'ee <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> on an Endless Chain of Events (Hawaadith):</b>    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/sullam-wusul-mutee-2-103.gif align=right border=1 hspace=10 width=400 border=0> First, al-Asnawi says (at the top): "The infinite regress (endless chain) which is impossible is the endless chain of contingent effects and causes (meaning each and every effect and cause is dependent on a prior one for its own existence). As for an endless chain in aathaar (effects, events) then we do not submit that it is impossible, and this endless chain is in relation to the aathaar (effects, events). Al-Asfahani said in Sharh al-Mahsul, "And this (what is said by al-Asnawi) has an observation against it because binding from it is the permissibility of events which have no beginning, and this is false in our view."    <P>
Then Bakheet al-Mutee'ee comments, quote: Al-Asnawi said: "The infinite regress (endless chain) which is impossible is the endless chain of (dependent) effects and causes (meaning each effect and cause requires a prior one for its existence). As for an endless chain in aathaar (effects) then we do not submit ... to the end." His speech is good, and as for the saying of al-Asfahani "And this (what is said by al-Asnawi) has an observation against it because binding from it is the permissibility of events which have no beginning, and this is false in our view", then we say: Just because it is baatil (false) in his view does not mean that it is baatil (false in reality) and in the matter itself. <b>Because right until now, there has not been any evidence established for the impossibility of an endless chain (infinite regress) of aathaar (effects, events) present in external (reality), even if (the view) that an endless chain in this regard is impossible is widespread</b>. And that the view of an endless chain of events (hawaadith) is binding from [this view] does not harm the aqidah unless when we say, "<i>There is no beginning to them (meaning,  each and every one of the events does not have a beginning)</i>" with the meaning "<i>(no beginning) to their existence (wujood)</i>" and this has not been said by anybody. <u>Everybody is agreed</u> that whatever is besides Allaah, the Exalted, from what has been or is yet to be, is originated, recent (<a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>), meaning, came to existence after non-existence, irrespective of looking at whether there is a limit to them in the past and future, or there is not limit to them (in the past and future) or to one of them (past or future). Do you not see that the consensus has been established upon the bliss of the people of Paradise, that it does not end and does not stop at a limit in the future, and after it itself had been originated (<a href='../tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>) with the meaning that it existed after non-existence. It does not harm us if we say that there is no end to it with the meaning that its individual instances will never cease and the absence of any limit at which they stop. But if we were to say that there is no end to them, with the meaning that their eternity is obligatory by virtue of their own inherent right, this would be disbelief. <b>And likewise in the past, we speak of events without a beginning with the meaning that their individual instances do not have a limit at which they stop, and every single one of them existed after non-existence, however they do not cease within the infinite past. And if we said "there is no beginning to their (individual) existence (wujood) and there is no commencement for them (as in, for each individual instance, thereby making each individual instance eternal and without beginning)" then that would be speaking with their eternity and that is disbelief</b>...

This is from "<i>Sullam al-Wusool li Sharh Nihaayt al-Sool</i>"  of al-Mutee'ee (Aalam al-Kutub, Cairo, 1343H, 2/103). And this is the exact same thing that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says as is famous and well-known in all of his books in which he refutes the <a href='../tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a>, and we will give just one short quote here for its pertinence, <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says in al-Safadiyyah (2/50), "<i>And so it has become clear that alongside the saying of the permissibility (<i>jawaaz</i>) of continuous events (<i>hawaadith</i>) in the past, rather, even with speaking of the obligation (wujoob) of that, it is still impossible (alongside this saying) for the universe to be eternal or anything from the universe (to be eternal)</i>." And also his saying in Minhaj al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah (1/376), "<i>And this is an independent evidence that whatever is besides Allaah is originated (<a href='../tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>), coming to existence after it was not, and that He the Sublime is the creator of everything after it was nothing. So sublime is the one who is singled out with al-baqaa (everlastingness) and al-qidam (eternity), and He made binding upon everything besides Him to be originated from nothing</i>."    <P>

<blockquote>And al-Fakhr <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> mentioned in al-Mataalib al-Aaliyah that the saying of the one who said: That He, the Exalted, is one who speaks with speech established with His essence and through His will and choice is the most sound of all sayings, both in terms of revealed text and sound reason.</blockquote>    <P>
In other words, <a href='../tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> acknowledges that what the Mutakallimin refer to as "<i>hawaadith</i>" for Allaah, is something that all factions are bound to accept, due to it being the soundest of all sayings. And when this is the case with speech, then likewise with action, as is the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah, and alongside all of this, that Allaah should eternally be one who speaks and acts if He wills,  then it is impossible alongside this for anything besides Him (brought about through his speech and action) to be eternal, without being preceded by non-existence. And with this, we see al-Naruiji's spiders web in ruins and the fraud of his attempt to malign <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> laid bare.  </div>    <P>
To summarize:    <P>
<blockquote>Ahl al-Sunnah say Allaah created the creation through speech and action which are tied to His will and power and since He is eternally like this and was never devoid of His attributes, then it is permissible and possible (<i>yajuz, yumkin</i>) to speak of an endless chain of events in the past [and this refers to Allaah's actions and what results from them of things external to His self] without that necessitating that any entity is eternal with Allaah, without having a beginning for its existence. Even if alongside that we say that the perpetual existence of <u>the genus</u> of created events (following on from Allaah eternally being one who speaks and acts as He wills) is a <u>permissible</u> or <u>possible</u> matter and for which <u>there is no evidence</u> that proves it impossible, neither through reason nor through revelation. And the illustration of that is simple. <u>We ask the Mutakallimeen</u>. <b>Is it possible <u>or</u> impossible for Allah to have created anything before the heavens and earth?</b> If they say "<i>Yes, it is possible or permissible</i>", then they have affirmed the permissiblity of an endless chain of events, because we can then ask the same question for that prior created thing, was it possible or impossible for Allaah to have created something prior to it. So this falsifies the basis of their entire theology and bang goes their corrupt proof of huduth al-ajsaam that relies upon the premise of an endless chain of events being <u>impossible</u> (for which they have <u>no</u> proof). And if they say, "<i>No, it is impossible</i>", then they are speaking about Allaah without knowledge and have no proof for this saying and it is a revilement upon Allaah's power, and it opposes what is indicated in the texts of created things prior to the creation of the heavens and earth [which they spuriously claim was the beginning of "space" and "time" - blindly-following the atheists in that saying!], such as <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, the water, the pen, the preserved tablet, which in turn indicate the permissibilty of other entities and events we have not specifically been informed of but on account of the generality of evidences in the Book and Sunnah are a permitted matter. <b>Further, just like it is obligatory to affirm that Allaah is al-Aakhir (the Last, after whom there is none) whilst believing at the same time that Paradise is eternal, along with its inhabitants, then the issue of believing in the permissibility (jawaaz) or possibility (imkaan) of an endless chain of events in the past (each and every single one of which was preceded by its own non-existence) alongside affirming Allaah to be al-Awwal (the First, before whom there was none) poses no problem at all.</b> Let any <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> explain to us any real difference between this or that!</blockquote>    <P>
If you have patiently persevered so far and striven to grasp what has preceded, rejoice! Now is the time to go and marvel at the antics of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their sister-groups... <b><a href=../indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5!</a></b> ... how the <a href='../tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> and Mutakallimun explain the origin of the universe!    <P>
  </blockquote>    <P>
