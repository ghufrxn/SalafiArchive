They are the followers of the <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Creed of negating their is a Lord above the heaven and a deity above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - adopting in all of that, the philosophical theological speculation that they inherited from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (their source and root) - and the axis of which is the proof called "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", a corrupt, flawed proof for demonstrating the universe is created. They fraudulently pose as followers of <a href='../tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="../tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> - when he is free of them and their Jahmee creed - and they attempt to masquerade the ta'weels of Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 333H) as the ta'weels of Ahl us-Sunnah when in fact they are simply what al-Maturidi compiled of the ta'weels of <a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> and Bishr al-Mareesee that became widespread in the second and third century after hijrah, and which were adopted by the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and which were used to protect their "intellectual proof" (see below). These <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> actively promote indulging in <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (theological philosophical speculation) and this is verbally stated by them in their videos, claiming that it is necessary for them to get involved with ilm ul-kalaam to deal with issues in Philadelphia.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What is the Essence of Ilm ul-Kalaam (Theological Speculation)</font>    <P>
This ilm ul-kalaam is the very one that the Salaf reprimanded and whose practitioners they declared astray and warned against. The ilm ul-kalaam in particular, is that which is related to the "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" or "hulool ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam" - the (corrupt and false) intellectual proof for the createdness of the universe that the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah have made to be the foundation of their religion, and as a result of which they were forced to negate the attributes to varying degrees, otherwise their proof would become invalidated. This is because their proof demonstrates that something being subject to <u>qualities (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='../tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith)</u> is evidence of it being a created body (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - and thus they had to deny - to varying degrees - whatever Allaah affirmed for himself to keep this Taaghootee principle of theirs, honored and sanctified.     <P>
<ul><li>Thus, <u>Jahm and the Jahmiyyah</u> denied that Allaah could be described with anything, because that would have falsified their proof against the Atheists, although they were forced to acknowledge Him being "al-Khaaliq" and "al-Qaadir" as well as a few others (like "al-Muhyee" etc.), because they said that only Allaah is described with these - but as for all other names and attributes that can be applied to the creation as well as the Creator, then they denied them all.    <P>
<li><u>The Mu'tazilah</u> affirmed the Names because they saw the corruption in the view of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, since Allaah clearly affirms Names for Himself in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, but they affirmed them only on the surface, claiming all the names are synonymous and do not have separate independent meanings or attributes behind them, and in this they managed to affirm the Names (or pretend to) and at the same time prevent the invalidation of the "intellectual proof".     <P>
<li><u>The Kullaabiyyah</u>, affirmed some of the attributes (sifaat dhaatiyyah) but denied others (<a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>) when they saw the corruption in the view of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and they tried to combine between the deen of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the deen of the People of Hadeeth and Athar - trying to tread a middle ground - attempting to affirm something of the Attributes whilst trying to avoid falsifying the intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>".  So they found a way to justify the acceptance the <a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah (Attributes of the Essence) and explain how they do not invalidate the intellectual proof, whilst being forced to reject the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (Attributes of Action) because these necessitated that Allaah is subject to occurrences (hawaadith) - and they could not find any way to make these compatible with their intellectual proof - there was a plain contradiction. So <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) was the Imaam of the <a href='../tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> who accepted some of the Attributes, and the bulk of his positions were characterized by the attempt to tread a middle ground between the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the People of the Sunnah, and Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took the bulk of his creed from <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>.    <P>
<li>And the deen of <u>the Ash'ariyyah</u> is in fact the deen of the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> simply took up the creed of <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in the middle stage of his life, and while he adopted the creed of Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar at the end of his life, his followers thereafter, remained attached to his Kullaabite doctrines which later comprised the deen of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. However, an important distinction must be made between the earlier <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and later <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. The earlier <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> had sounder positions on Allaah's <a href='../tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and some of His Attributes besides the seven. Those Ash'aris who came later, such as <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), <a href='../tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) unfortunately directed the madhhab of the Ash'aris in creed further in the direction of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> than in the direction of the people of hadeeth and athar. This is because they considered that some of the views held by the <a href='../tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> such as Allaah being above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence and not a body (<a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and affirmation of the attributes of Face, Hands and Eyes <u>without ta'weel</u>, could not in truth be reconciled with the "intellectual proof", so they reverted back to the views of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on those issues and thus they outright rejected Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence and they adopted the ta'weels of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in regards to <a href='../tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/arsh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arsh</font></a> (<a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>) and the attributes of Face, Hands and Eyes - to explain them away and to maintain and protect their intellectual proof.</ul>     <P>
All these factions agree upon <u>the foundation</u>, which is the intellectual proof for the createdness of the universe (whilst bearing in mind their differences in its subsidiary details) but then <u>they differ regarding what should and should not be negated from Allaah</u> of:    <P>
<ul><li>Names  <li>Attributes of the Essence and   <li>Attributes tied to His Will and Power (<a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>) </ul>    <P>
in order to keep that intellectual proof intact. So we can see they all differ in this regard - the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah - and all these factions are collectively known as the "Mu'attilah" (Deniers of the Attributes) and the "<a href="../tags/mutakallimoon.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mutakallimoon</font></a>" (Speculative Theologians).    <P>
And then they also differ as what methods ought to be used to deny these attributes, is it purely <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, or is tafweed or a combination of both or what?     <P>
And from the plainest of falsehoods is their inability to lay down any sound, solid principle that allows them to determine whether an attribute should be subject to <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or not and because of this, the later ones amongst the Mu'attilah fabricated "tafweed" claiming it was the way of the Salaf, and the reason they invented "tafweed" because in "<a href="../tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" they did not find a satisfactory solution - because their ta'weels differed, so either one person was lying and the other was truthful or vice versa, and inside their souls they knew in reality that they are speaking about Allaah without knowledge. Thus, they fabricated the doctrine of "tafweed" claiming it was the way of the Salaf.     <P>
And then there are differences between themselves, so some of the Ash'aris who claim <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is the way refute others who claim tafweed is the way, and then the Ash'aris refute Maturidis, and vice versa on this subject of "<a href="../tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" and "Tafweed" and which of these ought to be route through which their intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and "hulool ul-a'raad" should be kept intact.    <P>
So this is the foundation of their falsehood and we advise all Muslims to be wise to it and to understand it well so as not to be ensnared by it.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To understand why the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> raise these doubts you must go and read the article mentioned below for some good background information first - it will help set the wider context for what is in this article as well as many other articles on this site:     <P>

So the issue is manifestly clear through these statements from these Imaams of the Salaf and they are all from the mid-second century after hijrah - before <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and al-Maturidi were even born.

There is no escaping from this - <u>except that these cowards are not bold enough to come out and say that</u>.     <P>
Their only response to these hard facts regarding the creed of the early <a href='../tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> of "Allaah being above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without that necessitating jismiyyah" - after having managed to get back on their feet and escape the hissy-fit that these hard facts put them in - is to claim that the Ash'aris at different times through history had to use different levels of ilm ul-kalaam in order to counter the heretics.     <P>
So the <a href='../tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> said Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a body and the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> said Allaah being above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates He is a body. Yes, that great, lofty, noble goal of "refuting the heretics" allows for it to be held, "its white" in one century, and "its black" in another, and for both to be considered the truth - and so we don't know which ilm ul-kalaam these deluded <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of the 21st Century have made to be the foundation of their religion except that it derives more from the psyche of Mulla Nasruddin than it does from the atheist <a href='../tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - from whom their ilm ul-kalaam was derived - and who were at least <u>rationally and intellectually more sound and consistent in their disbelief and misguidance, despite their disbelief and misguidance</u>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Jahmite Ash'aris of Philly Attempting to Pass Off Their Jahmi Creed as the Creed of Ahl us-Sunnah</font>    <P>

And you can see the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far <a href=../indexa274.html?zrchw>taking care of him at this location</a>.    <P>
So here he is, he's brought the ta'weels of <a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> and Bishr al-Mareesee, compiled by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, in that bag by his side, and he calls this uluw ul-himmah (lofty concern).    <P>

And with the psychological comfort of the ta'weels of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> being by his side in the bag - and thereby feeling a sense of security about "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", the intellectual proof of <a href='../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> that is the base and foundation of his deen -  he gleefully propounds the deen of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that there is no Lord above the heaven and no Deity above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - a corrupt saying that in the view of the Salaf tends towards <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a>, and which the Salaf scorned, reviled and abused centuries before the "<a href="../tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" were even known as a faction.

So it has become necessary to expose his treachery and scandal in misrepresenting the speech of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in which he (Shaykh ul-Islaam) is refutating the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their claim that Allaah is within all of creation (including the interiors of dogs and swines) lofty and exalted is Allaah from that with a lofty exaltation.

<b><u>The Claim of the Jahmite</u></b>    <P>
The Jahmee made some remarks on the following saying of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (Majmoo Fataawaa 16/100):    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ibn-taymiyyah-jahmiyyah-uluww-hulool.gif border=0>    <P>
The translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>For the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> [who] say that He (Allaah) is in every place with His Essence, or that He is neither within the universe, nor outside of it, [then] they do not describe Him with "highness" exclusive of "lowness". For if He was in a location [according to the view of the Jahmites], then amongst the locations are those which are elevated and those which are low, thus, He would be [upon the belief of the Jahmites] high in the high (location) and low in the low (location). Rather, when they said, "<i>He is in every place</i>", then they have made all the locations to be places that He occupies, and as containers and  receptacles, and they made them, in reality, to be higher than Him (i.e. above Him). For a place contains that which is inside  (it), and the vessel and container (both) contain that which is surrounded (by them), and the container is above what is contained (by it). </blockquote>    <P>
And this statement of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> occurs in his tafseer of Surah al-A'laa, and in which he discusses that "al-A'laa" is a name of praise which means that He is the highest, above everything, and is an affirmation of <a href='../tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and that the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, amongst them are the Hulooli <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, those who say Allaah is in every place, and the Mu'attil <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, those who say Allaah is neither within the universe nor outside of it - so the first speak with <a href='../tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a>, such as Ibn Arabi and the people of wahdat ul-wujood, and the second group speak with what necessitates Allaah's non-existence.    <P>
So <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is talking about those who claim He is in every place and stating the implications of their statement and belief. And inshaa'Allaah, we will give a  more detailed synopsis of the whole passage a little later.    <P>
So from the remarks that this <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> made upon this quoted passage were the following:    <P>

And also:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/philly-scandal-sandalanee-kalaam4.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
So he has taken three words (in Arabic) of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, "the container is above the contained", and claimed that through this <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has made Allaah to contain the creation within Himself.    <P>

They absolutely have no choice in this matter, they are forced to do reject it and wage a war against it.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Satisfying the Gluttony For Punishment Of the <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> With the Sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far</font>    <P>
After being looked after with the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far <a href=../indexa274.html?zrchw>on a previous occasion</a>, it looks like this individual has developed the Stockholm Syndrome, has grown fond of the sandal and has come begging for more.     <P>
And inshaa'Allaah, his appetite can be satisfied with the following:    <P>
<b><u>Point 1: Treachery in Quotation And Twisting the Context Is From The Distinguishing Hallmarks of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - If They Did It With the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Then What Prevents Them From Doing It With the Statements of the Scholars</u></b>    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> It is known that that the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of old, when they wanted to argue for their <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a>, that Allaah is in every place (the Hulooli Jahmites), they would bring only parts of whole verses, such as "<b>Allaah is with you wherever you may be</b>..." or that "<b>There is no secret counsel of three except that He is the fourth</b>", and then they would leave what is before or after these parts which explains that it is in reference to His knowledge (ilm) that He is in every place, and not in reference to His Essence (dhaat).    <P>
So if these <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were bold enough to do this with the Qur'aan in order to deceive the people, then what prevents them from doing this with the speech of the Scholars. Let's take a look at some paragraphs before and after and see what is going on more fully ...    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ibn-taymiyyah-jahmiyyah-uluww-hulool-2.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And the intent here is that His <a href='../tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness, elevation) is from the attributes of praise that are binding for Him. It is not permissible for Him to be described with the opposite of <a href='../tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, ever. And for this reason, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said in the authentic hadeeth:    <P>
You are the first (al-Awwal) there is nothing before You, and you are the last (al-Aakhir) there is nothing after You, and You are the Most High, (adh-Dhaahir) there is nothing above you, and you are the Nearest (al-Baatin) there is nothing nearer than You.    <P>
And he did not say, "below you (tahtaka)" and we have spoken about this hadeeth in other than this place.    <P>
And when it is like that, then those who opposed the Book and the Sunnah and what the Salaf were upon, they do not make Him (as one) described with <a href='../tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness, highness) exclusive to sufool (lowness). Rather, they either describe Him with both aboveness and lowness, or (with words) that necessitate that, or they negate both highness and lowness from him, and they are of two types.    <P>
For the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> [who] say that He (Allaah) is in every place with His Essence, or that He is neither within the universe, nor outside of it, [then] they do not describe Him with "highness" exclusive of "lowness". For if He was in a location [according to the view of the Jahmites], then amongst the locations are those which are elevated and those which are low, thus, He would be [upon the belief of the Jahmites] high in the high (location) and low in the low (location). Rather, when they said, "<i>He is in every place</i>", then they have made all the locations to be places that He occupies, and as containers and  receptacles, and they made them, in reality, to be higher than Him (i.e. above Him). For a place contains that which is inside  (it), and the vessel and container (both) contain that which is surrounded (by them), and the container is above what is contained (by it).     <P>
And the Salaf, the leading Scholars and all of the Scholars of the Sunnah, when they say, "He is above the Throne", and "He is above the heaven, above everything", they do not say that there is something that contains Him or surrounds Him, or that it is a place, or container, or receptacle for Him, Sublime and Exalted is He from that, rather He is above everything, and He is free from need of everything, and everything is needy of Him, and He is above everything, and He is the carrier of <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and its carriers with His power and ability, and every created thing is in need of Him, and He is free of need of <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and from every created thing.</blockquote>    <P>
In this particular instance, the context of the quote is that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is refuting the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who claim Allaah is both above and below or who do not describe Him with being either above or below, and the context is one of refuting the <a href='../tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> (indwelling) that the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> innovated, and thus, in their claim of Allaah being everywhere, it is necessitated that Allaah is contained by things, and given the <a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> claim that Allaah is in all things, then "the container is above what it contains", and thus they made things above Him,even though they refuse to describe Him to be above - so the passage is establishing this, and a little later <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> mentions how these <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> considered the saying of Fir'awn, "<b>I am your Lord Most High</b>", to be the truth, so they do not have a problem in describing things from the creation as being "above" and "high" as a means of praise, yet they do not do this for Allaah, the Most High, exclusively, and as they claim He is in all things, contained by them, then they made things to be higher than Him in reality.    <P>
So <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is explaining the fasaad (corruption) and evil in their viewpoint. And when someone is refuting the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and explaining the false necessities of their view, then it is not permissible for you to impute the one refuting them with the false necessities that he is mentioning - because his speech is in the context of refutation (ar-radd) and not one of making iqraar (affirmation) of one's own creed, and there is a difference between speech when it is made in the course of refuting (ar-radd) an opposer and between when it is made in the course of affirming (iqraar) one's belief and stating it.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And you can see that in the <u>last paragraph</u> in the quote above <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is making <b>iqraar (corroboration)</b> of what is the truth, and affirming it as the creed to be held and believed. And as for what is before it, then he is speaking about <u>the false necessities</u> of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who do not affirm <a href='../tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> for Allaah exclusively - so here this is <b>"radd" (refutation)</b> and showing the falsehood of their view, through its false implications and necessities.</div>    <P>
The Jahmee has claimed therefore, that since <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has said "the container is above the contained" in relation to the view of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, that therefore, the view held by <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that Allaah being above the Heaven, above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - which is in all the revealed Books, and it is what all the Prophets and Messengers spoke with, and which the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was sent with, and which the Prophet invited to, and which the Companions explicitly expressed and which the entirety of the Salaf were agreed upon and which the <a href='../tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> were upon, as well as many other factions - that this view necessitates the creation is contained by Allaah, <u>on  account of these three words</u> that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> mentioned in the course of refuting the Hulooli <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.     <P>
So the reality of what is going on in this Jahmee's mind is this:    <P>
<blockquote>Hey, I can see <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is refuting the Hulooli <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and he is showing that given their belief that Allaah is in everything, then in that case, we know that the container is above what it contains, and therefore, the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> have made all things above Him in reality, whilst at the same time they do not affirm aboveness for Allaah exclusively, despite them considering "aboveness" (of the essence) to be praiseworthy for things within the creation. So what I am going to do is I am going to take three of his words, "al-haawee fawq al-mahwee" (the container is above the contained) which <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> stated to explain that the necessity of their saying is that all things are above Him in reality, and I am going to claim that since <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is having a go at these Jahmees and refuting them for not holding that Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and since he has used this statement "the container is above the contained" to show how their view necessitates that all things contain Allaah and are above Him, which is a revilment, then I am going to make it look as if <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, because he is criticizing them for this, <u>must hold the opposite of this</u> which is Allaah is above all things and contains them. Why? Simply because he mentioned this statement, "the container is above what it contains", and since he holds, at the same time, that Allaah is above the heaven, above His creation, then it can be surmised that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> <u>must hold</u> that Allaah contains the creation within Himself. And as for the clear explicit clarifications regarding this matter, where <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> declares such a presumption about Allaah to be a "corrupt belief", and from the false presumptions of the oppressors (dhaalimoon) then I'm not interested in that at all, because then it will become clear to all people that it is me and my likes who are guilty of initiating this false presumption, by being the first to give rise to it in our minds, and they will realize that we are simply trying to throw our dirt onto <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>...</blockquote>    <P>
And the intent of the Jahmee isn't to attack <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> as much as it is to attack the creed of the Book and the Sunnah, that Allaah is above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence. If you attack <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, you can get away with it, but if you attack the actual Book and the Sunnah, then all people know you to be a deviant Jahmee. And in reality, if these people were truthful, they would come and express their true reality by saying the following:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Considering that all people in all parts of the earth,  always seek Allaah in the direction of above, then what is mentioned in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah that Allaah is above the creation, this necessitates that Allaah is containing the creation within His Essence, and that He surrounds them from all sides and is thus, containing the creation in the manner of a sphere containing another. It is only in this this manner that Allaah can be <u>rationally understood</u> to be above them all, and for it to be <u>rationally understood</u> that there is no contradiction between a person being in Canada calling upon Allaah above Him and a person in South Africa calling upon Allaah above Him </blockquote>    <P>
But the Jahmee is a coward and is not bold enough to come out and say that it is the texts of the Book and the Sunnah that necessitate this "rationality". But this is what they really want to say, they want to impose their own limited rationalities upon the revealed texts, so if they were truthful and honest, they would express what their real problem is, its with the revealed texts.    <P>
So coming to our point - if you are a third party to a dispute between two people, Zayd Jahmee and Ahmad Sunnee. And Zayd Jahmee is saying that Allaah is within everything, in dogs, swines, in the toilets and bellies of men and women, and Ahmad Sunnee is refuting this kufr, and exposing it and showing its repugnance - and you are a third party to all of this, watching and observing - and your only response is to take three words from Ahmad Sunnee and then you launch an attack on him and impute to him from these three words, something that he is free of, and which he explicitly refutes elsewhere and says is a "corrupt belief" - then this is from the greatest of signs of your allegiance to Zayd Jahmee and from the greatest of signs of your treachery towards the one who is expressing the truth in the actual issue that is the subject of the discussion.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And all the while, we do not see from you the same vitriol and same fierce attack against the likes of Zayd Jahmee or against the extremist Soofees Nazim Qubrusi, or Hisham Kabbani and others, who believe and expound Wahdat ul-Wujood, and who have statements about Allaah that are repugnant and vile and are manifest kufr, and we do not see anything except silence towards the likes of these factions - so with all of this, your hypocrisy in your actions and your fake piety and fake jealousy for the religion is made apparent, when you make a display of "tanzeeh" to the people. The reality is that the revealed texts falsify your intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and thus you are forced by necessity to make <a href='../tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of them, of tafweed of them, and to attack and malign anyone who stands in the way and prevents you from defending and protecting that corrupt and false intellectual proof which you have made to be the foundation of your religion.</div>    <P>
And this is the generality of what you find with all of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, everything they take from Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is in the course of his refutation of the deviants from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and others from the Mu'attilah, and then they make interpolations from isolated statements that are made in the course of such refutations and then devise and build a creed for <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> around these words, and then ascribe it to him, and then go on to rebuke him for it - when he is free and innocent of such a concocted thing and it is often the case that he explicitly rejects and refutes what they have fabricated upon him (yes, even centuries after his death) in other places!    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: Does <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> Hold That Allaah Contains the Creation Within Himself?</u></b>    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> This issue has been dealt with specifically in another article and <a href=../index22f0.html?cvkis>you can read that here</a>. <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is answering a question related to <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and this is in the treatise "ar-Risaalah al-Arshiyyah", which is in Majmoo al-Fataawaa (6/545-592) - and in the course of this, <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> touches upon the issue which is related to this claim that the <a href='../tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="../tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> have made against him many centuries later - and we don't know of anyone prior this or last century who made this claim - Allaah knows best.    <P>
We can summarize the essence of the discussion of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> releated to this issue in this "Risaalah":    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah is answering a question posed to him regarding <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and supplicating to Allaah in directions other than what one finds instinctively which is to face above and from the answer to this question we can summarize that <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> holds on the basis of the verse in the Qur'an:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'><b>  They have made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him.

And what is reported in the authentic ahaadeeth regarding this verse which are found in two Saheehs and also what is reported from the Salaf and from Ibn Abbas in particular, regarding this verse:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is within them and between them are not in the Hand of ar-Rahman except like a mustard seed in the hand of one of you</blockquote>    <P>
That Allaah is greater and mightier and greater than everything, and that the universe compared to Allaah is extremely small, and as such the meaning of <a href='../tags/ihaatah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihaatah</font></a> (<a href='../tags/encompassment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>encompassment</font></a>) is understood in light of this, and not upon the false, <u>corrupt belief</u>, as <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> calls it, that the universe is contained by Allaah in the manner of a sphere contained and surrounded by another. And thus, [in addition to the meanings of <a href='../tags/encompassment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>encompassment</font></a> in knowledge (ilm), and in power (qudrah)], then the texts indicate <a href='../tags/encompassment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>encompassment</font></a> from this angle also and because the texts have alluded to it, then it is spoken with in a manner that befits His Majesty and which is based upon these texts, <u>and not upon any false and corrupt beliefs like what is presumed by the dhaalimoon (oppressors)</u>, exalted is Allaah from what they say, that Allaah contains the universe in His Self.     <P>
And that all of the texts support each other, thus, Allaah is above the heaven, above His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and Allaah is mightier than everything, and the heavens and earth are extremely small to Allaah - all of these are found in the revealed texts, and thus, when we consider that all people in all parts of the earth, seek Allaah in the direction of above, no matter where they are, then we only speak on the basis of what we know from the texts, and thus Allaah's <a href='../tags/encompassment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>encompassment</font></a> is in the manner alluded to in the saying of Ibn Abbaas. And upon this, all the doubts in this regard are removed, for that then explains that all people in all parts of the earth are indeed seeking Allaah when they seek Him above, and who is in truth above them all.     <P>
This is essentially what <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying, and here is a passage from towards the end of the treatise:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>It has become clear, in all assumptions (of what the case might be), that turning to Allaah is not permissible except (in the direction of) above, alongside His being above His <a href='../tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, separate and distinct from His creation, and regardless of whether it is assumed that He encompasses the creation - in the manner that He encompasses them when they are in His grasp - or if it is assumed that He is above them and encompasses them without Him grasping them, then in either of these two assumptions, He is above them, separate and distinct from them.    <P>
And it has become clear upon this assumption with respect to the Creator and this assumption with respect to <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> that there is no (reason) for any caution (in this) or (the presence of any) contradiction, and this puts and end to all the doubt, and the doubt only emanates out of <u>two corrupt beliefs</u>:    <P>
<u>The first of them</u>: That it be thought that <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, if it is spherical, and that Allaah is above it, it is binding that Allaah is spherical,  and then <u>[the second]</u> (that he) believes that if He is spherical, then it is correct to turn to whatever is spherical - such as the ninth celestial orbit -  from all the (various) directions.    <P>
<u>And both of these two beliefs are incorrect and misguidance</u>, for Allaah, alongside Him being above <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and alongside the (assumption of the) saying that <a href='../tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="../tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is spherical - regardless of whether it is (assumed to be) the ninth celestial sphere or other than it - it is not permissible for it to be thought that He resembles the celestial bodies in their shapes, just like it is not permissible that it be though that He resembles them in their sizes and their attributes - Sublime and Exalted is Allaah from what the oppressors say with a great exaltation. <b>Rather, it has become clear that He is mightier and greater than that the creation should be to Him like the interior of a celestial body within a celestial body</b>. Rather, the creation to Him, is smaller than a peppercorn or a chick-pea and what is similar to that in the hand of one of us.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is based upon what has been said by Ibn Abbaas, as he mentioned earlier, that "<i>The seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is within them and between them are not in the Hand of ar-Rahman except like a mustard seed in the hand of one of you</i>" - and this is reported by <a href='../tags/ibn-jareer-at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jareer <a href="../tags/at-tabari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Tabari</font></a></font></a> in his tafseer and also by as-Suyooti in ad-Durr al-Manthoor (5/336).    <P>
From this it is clear that the insinuation that if Allaah is above all of His servants, in all parts of the earth, and if all His servants seek Him above, that this means that Allaah contains the creation within Himself like a sphere containing another, that this is a corrupt belief, and that it is from foolishness to hold such a belief.     <P>
Then he continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'> When a chick-pea or a peppercorn, rather a dirham or a dinar, or a ball that a child plays with and what is similar to that, is in the hand of a person, or is beneath him, or whatever is similar to that, does any intelligent person, when he perceives the elevation of the person over it and his <a href='../tags/encompassment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>encompassment</font></a> of it, that the person is like a celestial (spherical) body?

Glorified is He, and High is He above all that they associate as partners with Him! (Az-Zumar 39:67)  </b><img src='../images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
So these words are very clear and earlier, <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said, in some important words:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And the intent is that whatever has come from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) on this subject and other than it, then all of it is the truth, and part of it establishes the truth of the other part, and it is (all) in agreement with the innate instinct of the creation, and with what they have been granted of clear intellects (al-aql as-sareeh) and sound objectives (al-qasd as-saheeh) - it does not oppose the clear intellect and nor the sound objective and nor the upright fitrah and nor the sound transmission that is established from the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).     <P>
But only he thinks that there is opposition between them (i.e. between the clear intellect, sound objective, the upright fitrah and the revealed text) who believes the false narrations, or who understands from them that which is not in them, or who believes something he thinks is from the rational things, when in reality it is from foolish things.</blockquote>    <P>
And what is meant here is that when we look at whatever has come in the revealed texts, then they are all considered in light of each other, and they are all placed together and with each other, and when we do that, we see that some of these texts support and clarify the truth of others - and it is on this basis that we can hold that no matter where a servant is, Allaah is always above Him when he seeks Allaah above - without falling into anything that is not befitting - because we are limiting ourselves to the texts and reconciling between them, and thus we are free from "corrupt beliefs" such as Allaah being like a celestial sphere that contains the creation, rather we hold that in which there is consistency and congruency on the basis of all the texts put together.     <P>
Whereas on the other hand, those people who use rationalities, and who are averse to the revealed texts, then they will start bringing absurdities and start imagining the "corrupt beliefs" such as "<i>if all people are seeking Allaah above them, no matter where on the earth they are, then it means Allaah must be completely surrounding the creation from every side and is thus like a sphere containing another sphere</i>" - so these are the people who try to engage rationalities and who invent false necessities because they have not fully submitted to the truth contained in the revealed texts and these false corrupt beliefs actually originated in their minds in the first place! And these are none other than the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, they are the ones who presume these false things in their mind, then they impute these false things to the people of the Sunnah, when the people of the Sunnah are free of these slanders and insinuations as you can see.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
Another fraud of the <a href='../tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="../tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> has been uncovered  and its just another example of establishing their creed through attacking personalities - why? Because their creed, if they were to openly call the people to it through its own language and terminology, <u>not one in thousand would accept it</u> and <u>the majority would tend to atheism</u>, as readily admitted by the Imaams of the Ash'aris themselves, such as <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='../tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) and <a href=../series/imaams-of-the-later-asharis-our-creed-would-lead-the-common-folk-to-atheism.html>you can see with your own eyes</a>, from their own books <a href=../series/imaams-of-the-later-asharis-our-creed-would-lead-the-common-folk-to-atheism.html>readily admitting this</a>.    <P>
Thus, their strategy is: Attack Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and throw as  many allegations as possible, hoping they will stick, in order to make the people think that he speaks with <a href='../tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='../tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and so on, and then once that is done, people will naturally incline to our creed "<i>not a <a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='../tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='../tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='../tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makaan, not inside the universe, not outside the universe, not above, not below</i>" more readily (go and read what <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> said in the link above)!     <P>
You see they can't come to the average Muslim and say,   <blockquote>  "We are going to teach you your deen. Now, first things first: <i>Allaah is not a <a href='../tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='../tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='../tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='../tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makaan, not inside the universe, not outside the universe, not above, not below, not within, not without...</i></blockquote>    <P>
They can't do that, because all people of sound fitrah will recognize this as <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> and gross <a href='../tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>. So instead they've got to do this: "<i>Ibn Taymiyyah says this ... and <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says that ... and <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> claims this ... and <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> claims that ...</i>" because this way its easier to deceive people and to foster an environment where their creed (which tends towards atheism) doesn't look that bad after all, and seems perfectly natural. These are the realities of these people, so be not deceived! <P>
