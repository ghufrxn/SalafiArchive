<div class="articleContent">



<img src=../assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
We have covered in previous articles the view of the Kullaabite Ash'aris and the Later (<a href='../tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, whose letters and words we recite, hear and memorize is created - and then they innovated a saying based upon some poetry ascribed to a Christian poet called "al-Akhtal" in which they claimed that "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" in the Arabic  language refers only to the "meaning (ma'naa)" and not the "wording (lafdh)" - thereby uttering a great lie against the language of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs. Then they sought to use as evidence, a saying of 'Umar and certain verses from the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to argue for their aberration - all of which is against them and not for them - and that's the subject of a separate article.    <P>
So their saying became that Allaah's <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (which to them is just the meaning that is with Allaah's self from eternity) is "uncreated", whereas the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, which consists of letters and words, and which is recited, memorized, and heard is created (makhlooq). <u>Following on from this issue</u> is that of <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, are they created or not, and this is <u>directly connected</u> to and follows on from the issue of Allaah's speech (<a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and the Qur'aan.     <P>
So the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created (makhlooq) and hence arose their saying "al-ism ghayr ul-musammaa" (the noun, name is other than the entity being so named) - and they  meant by this that the Names of Allaah are created, following on from their saying that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created because it consists of letters and words, and it is the created expression of Jibreel, hence it is  "other" than Allaah, and because "<b>al-ism <u>ghayr</u> al-musammaa</b>", then <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created.    <P>
And since the position of the Ash'aris is also that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which we have, which is letter and word, recited, heard and memorized, is created, then they had to concur with that view (of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) and claim that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created - even though outwardly they appear to be saying "Allaah's Names are not created" - we need to beware of this.    <P>
So we will first quote the sayings of <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee then go into a little more detail into the issue itself and the position and viewpoint of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imaam Ahmad: Saying <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are Created is Manifest, Plain, Clear Kufr</font>    <P>
From, "al-Masaa'il war-Rasaa'il al-Marwiyyah Anil-Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal Fil Aqeedah" (Issues and Treatise Narrated from <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal Regarding Aqeedah), 1/270-271, and all these narrations from Abu Dawud's "Masaa'il", and are also found in "as-Sunnah" of al-Khallaal:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ahmad-names-created-kufr.gif border=0>    <P>
Which we can translate as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Abu Dawud (as-Sijistani) said: I heard Ahmad, [and] a man had been mentioned to him who said, "The Names of Allaah are created", Ahmad said, "Plain, manifest kufr (disbelief)".    <P>
And in a narration of Abdul-Malik al-Maymoonee: That he said to Abu Abdullaah, "What do you say about the one who said the Names of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic are "muhdathah" (intending by muhdathah, "created")? So he said, "A Kaafir (disbeliever)". Then he said to me: [The name] "Allaah" is from His Names ... So their affair (that of the Jahmites) became grave and serious to him (Ahmad), and he would declare them disbelievers and he recited to me, "<b>Allaah is your Lord and the Lord of the very first ones...</b>", and he recited other verses.</blockquote>    <P>
And also from al-Laalikaa'ee's "Sharh Usool il-I'tiqaad" (tahqeeq Ahmad Hamdaan), 2/214, no. 351:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ahmad-names-created-kufr-laalikaaee.gif border=0>    <P>
Which we can translate as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>From Ibraaheem bin Haani' who said: I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal  - and he was concealed with me (hiding from the people) - so I asked him about the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and he said: "Whoever claimed that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created is a kaafir (disbeliever)".</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Important Note:</b>     <P>
<blockquote>The reason for the takfeer of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who said the Names of Allaah are created was because this was a natural extension of their saying that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have, which is letter and word and is recited, memorize and heard, is created. And the Salaf did not mean that the ink, paper and voice is not created, they were not refuting the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> for saying that the ink, paper and voices of the reciters are created. Rather, whilst the ink and paper of the printed <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the voice of the reciter when he recites is created, what is  written (maktoob) or recited (matloo) is not created, which are the letters and words that make up the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. You need to be clear about this difference, so as to get a good grasp of this entire issue.     <P>
Many of the Ash'aris are themselves confused on this issue and they don't really understand the position of the Salaf, and it is as if many of them they believe that the Salaf showed rejection against the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> for claiming that the written mushaf (copies of the Qur'an) and the actual voices of the reciters are created. This was not the case. The <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> rejected that Allaah has speech which is tied to His will and power such that He spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to Jibreel, who heard it and then spoke it to Muhammad (alayhis salaam), who heard it and conveyed it to the Ummah, and such that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as we have it, in its letters and words, originated with Allaah, as His speech, it is uncreated. And when it is written, whilst the ink and paper is created, the letters and words that make up the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> are the uncreated speech of Allaah. And when it is recited, whilst the voice we hear is created, what is being recited, the words, they originated with Allaah who spoke them and are uncreated. This is what the Salaf were establishing, and they refuted the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (and Mu'tazilah) on this matter.    <P>
The <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> wanted to deny this, because they could not accept attributes for Allaah and actions (tied to His will) because Allaah having attributes and actions (tied to His will) would mean that He is created according to their proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" that they were using against the Atheists. So they (Jahmiyyah and Mu'tazilah) denied Allaah has "speech" as an attribute of His essence, and following on from this view, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> could not have come from this "speech" that is an attribute of His essence, because they don't affirm attributes. So the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> denied Allaah speaks at all and said the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is something created, and the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> can be said to be Allaah's speech, but Allaah created it in other than Him, and it is just like "the House of Allaah" and "the She-Camel of Allaah". But the intent behind all of this was to deny that Allaah has attributes (<a href='../tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) tied to His will and power.     <P>
The <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> came along and whilst they agreed with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have is created, they simply innovated a new saying which is that Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is only the meaning that exists with His Self - and that is what is uncreated, but as for what we have with us, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then that is created, it is an expression (ibaarah) of that meaning present with Allaah. So in reality, their saying is the same as that of their predecessors. The only difference being that what the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> called "ilm" (knowledge) and "iraadah" (will), the Kullaabis and Ash'aris called "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" - <a href=../index2714.html?kiagk>see here for more details on this</a>.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee: The Names of Allaah Are Not Created</font>    <P>
Then the saying of ash-Shaafi'ee, as is reported by al-Laalikaa'ee (2/211), no. 343:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/shaafiee-names-kaffaarah-uncreated.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Ar-Rabee' bin Sulaymaan said: I heard as-Shaafi'ee saying: "Whoever swore an oath by a Name from the names of Allaah and then broke the oath then kaffaarah (expiation) is [obligatory] upon him, because the Name of Allaah is not created. And whoever swore an oath by the Ka'bah or as-Safaa and al-Marwah, then expiation is not upon him because [they] are created [things] whereas that (meaning, the Name) is not created.</blockquote>    <P>
And also from ash-Shaafi'ee (no. 344):    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/shaafiee-names-kaffaarah.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Ar-Rabee' said: Ash-Shaafi'ee said: "Whoever swore (an oath) by Allaah or by a Name amongst the names of Allaah, then kaffaarah (expiation) is binding upn him."</blockquote>    <P>
Notice here that as-Shaafi'ee distinguished between swearing by Allaah, and swearing by any of His Names, and at the same time he treated the Names to be uncreated - this will be better understood as you read through the rest of this article.    <P>
And also from ash-Shaafi'ee (no. 345), and al-Laalikaa'ee is narrating from ash-Shaafi'ee through his chain of narration:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/shaafiee-names-dispute-halfgif.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>From Muhammad bin Idrees ash-Shaafi'ee that he said: One of our associates narrated to us saying: Two men - a Muslim and a Jew - disputed [and raised the dispute to] <a href='../tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> bin Ibaan - and he was the qaadee of al-Basrah and he held the opinion of the people (the Mu'tazilah) [meaning he held <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created]. It turned out that making the oath of denial was upon the Muslim, so the Jew said, "Make him (the Muslim) take the oath". So he the (qaadee) said, "Swear (take an oath) [by] '<i>Allaah, the one besides whom there is none worthy of worship except He</i>'."     <P>
So the Jew said to the qaadee: "You claim that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and "<i>Allaah, the one besides whom there is none worthy of worship</i>" is from the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. So make him take an oath for me by the Creator and not something created."    <P>
So <a href='../tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (the qaadee) became bewildered and said: "Both of you leave until I consider (reflect upon) your affair."</blockquote>    <P>
And the saying of al-Asma'ee (d. 215H), again reported by al-Laalikaa'ee (2/212), no. 346 and no. 347 - with two separate chains of narration, whose wordings are both the same:    <P>

All of these narrations establish the view of the Salaf that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are uncreated, and this is because Allaah Himself named Himself with these Names - they are not names given to Him by the creation, these are <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, and Ahl us-Sunnah believe that Allaah spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Himself, in letter, word and voice and <u>that none of that is created</u> - and this is the point of dispute between Ahl us-Sunnah on the one hand and the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> on the other, who claim that the speech in letter, word and voice is created - as they do not accept that Allaah can speak whenever He wills and however He wills - and they wrongly presume that affirming "voice" meanings that the "voice" is like that of the creation, requiring a larynx and ligaments and so on - and all of this is baatil, it is a false necessity imposed by them - <b>and <a href='../tags/ibn-hajr-al-asqalani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani</font></a> has rebutted this argument in Fath ul-Bari in two separate places</b> (this is the subject of another article). All the Salaf were agreed and united that Allaah's speech is with letter and voice and and it is uncreated, and that His voice takes the same way as all the other attributes, we affirm it without <a href='../tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='../tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, and it is established explicitly in the revealed texts that Allaah has a "sawt", voice. It was <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> who innovated the "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" a saying never heard of before, and then <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took it from the Kullabis in Baghdad and carried this saying on, which the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> then adopted.    <P>
So in short, Allaah has always been "mutakallim" (one who speaks), and further, He speaks as He wills, when He wills, however He wills, and He spoke to Moses direct, and He spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to Jibreel, and this speech is with letter and voice, and all of that is uncreated, and what the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> contains of <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, that is also uncreated, as Allaah spoke His own Names in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, He named Himself with them, and they are from His speech.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> That <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are Created</font>    <P>
The <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> said, based upon their view that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, as they are found in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they too are created. So "ar-Rahmaan" and "ar-Raheem" and "al-Malik" and "al-Quddoos" and so on are all created. And in order to argue for this, they starting saying "<b>al-ism <u>ghayr</u> ul-musammaa</b>", which means "the noun is other than the [entity] being named by it". This was just empty and useless speech aimed at arguing for their belief that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created and therefore, other than Allaah - and this type of speech was unknown to the Salaf before the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> raised it. Note here that in saying this, the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are at one extreme, they are trying to separate between Allaah and His Names, by arguing that the definition of "ism" (noun, name) in the language is that it is other than the "musammaa" (the entity being named) - and while strictly speaking this is true, their intent was really to say <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created, built upon their claim that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will and therefore He did not speak the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is therefore created (and thus whatever is in it of Names are also created).    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>For the people have disputed regarding that, and the dispute became well-known regarding that after [the time] of the leading Scholars [of the Salaf], after Ahmad and others. And what used to be known with the Imaams of the Sunnah, Ahmad and others was: Showing rejection against the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who were saying, "the Names of Allaah are created".    <P>
So they were saying: "al-ism ghayr ul-musammaa" (the noun is other than the entity being named by it), and that the Names of Allaah are other than Him, and whatever is other than Him is created. And they are the ones whom the Salaf reprimanded, and were harsh with them in their speech, because the Names of Allaah are from His speech, and the speech of Allaah is uncreated. Rather, He is the one who spoke it, and He is the one who named Himself with what it contains of names.    <P>
And the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were saying: His speech is created, and His Names are created, and He Himself does not speak with speech that is established with His Essence, and nor did He name Himself with a name that He spoke with.     <P>
In fact they sometimes say: He spoke it (the Qur'an) and He named Himself with these Names, but with the meaning that He created that in others besides Him, not with the meaning that He Himself spoke it with speech that is established with His Essence.    <P>
Thus speaking about His Names is from (i.e. branches off from) speaking about His <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech).</blockquote>    <P>
<u>Recall</u> that the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> said Allaah does not have the attribute of speech and that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said that while <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created it can be said to be "Allaah's Speech" since it is His creation, just like it is said, "the House of Allaah", "the She-Camel of Allaah", "the Messenger of Allaah" and so on. <u>Recall</u> that the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> said, Allaah has speech "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", but it is only the "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", a meaning (ma'naa) present with  His self, and as for what we have of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, in its letters and words, then that is created. <b>So all of them are agreed that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, recited, read, heard, memorized, its letters and words, it is all created</b>. And the words of the Salaf <u>are against this saying</u> - they declared this saying <u>to be kufr</u>. And the Salaf did not mean by "uncreated" the ink and the paper and the voice of the reciter and so on, but they meant the actual words (kalimaat) that are written and recited. Because there is the writing <u>and what is written</u> and there is the recitation and <u>what is being recited</u>, and what has been written, and what has been recited originated with Allaah, He spoke it, because He speaks as He wills, when He wills, however He wills, and His speech is uncreated - and this is what the Salaf were establishing and it is for saying that what is written (maktoob), in letter and word, and what is recited (matloow) in letter and word is created that the Salaf declared the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> kafirs.    <P>
And following on from their views regarding the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, by natural extension, is the view of each of these factions (Jahmiyyah,  <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) regarding <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>. <u>They all hold that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created</u>. However, the <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> have simply concealed and veiled the reality of their saying with <a href=../indexf20d.html?hcxqe>the twigs and leaves</a> which are plays with words and definitions - which is something common to many of their viewpoints and positions.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Salaf's Refutation of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Takfeer of Them</font>    <P>

<b><u>The First Position:</u></b> <u>To withhold from speech regarding this issue</u> and neither to affirm nor negate it, so they would not say, "al-ism huwa al-musammaa" (the noun is that [entity] which has been named) and nor "al-ism ghayr ul-musammaa" (the noun is other than [entity] which has been named). This is the view of Abu Ja'far <a href='../tags/ibn-jareer-at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jareer <a href="../tags/at-tabari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Tabari</font></a></font></a> (d. 310H).    <P>
<b><u>The Second Position:</u></b> That "<b>al-ism <u>li</u> al-musammaa</b>" (the noun is a designation <u>for</u> the named entity) - <u>and this is the view of the majority of the people of the Sunnah and people of hadeeth</u>, and it is what is most correct, and is the saying of <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> - and this view is based upon the verses in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> such as:    <P>

And in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we see the use of the particle "li" which means "<u>for</u>" and "<u>to</u>" or "<u>belonging to</u>" And what this means is that the noun or name (al-ism) indicates and points to that entity being named (al-musammaa), but by definition, a noun or name (ism) does not refer to the named entity in and of itself, rather by definition a noun (ism) is <u>a word</u> used to refer to the entity. And in the hadeeth we find that Allaah is the one who named Himself with Names, as occurs in the hadeeth of Abdullah bin Mas'ood, and again we see in this hadeeth the use of the particle "li" (the laam) which denotes "for", "to", "belonging to":    <P>

So Allaah named Himself with these Names, and thus, they are not created, and Allaah revealed some of His Names (we don't know them all) in His Book and others He taught to the Prophets (such as what is found in the Sunnah) and others He kept with Himself in the knowledge of the Unseen, and they are all uncreated. But to the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, because these Names are in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (which to them is created) then the Names are created too.    <P>
And the view of Ahl us-Sunnah is based upon their saying that Allaah speaks with His will and power, and He names Himself with His will and His power - so Ahl us-Sunnah say yes, He names Himself with Names (as occurs in the authentic hadeeth), and in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which Allaah spoke through His will and power, there are Names that Allaah revealed which belong to Him - by speaking them in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Allaah has named Himself with them - and they hold all of that to be from His speech which is uncreated.    <P>
<b><u>The Third Position:</u></b> That "<b>al-ism <u>min</u> al-musammaa</b>" (the name or noun is from the named entity) and what this means, as it relates to <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> is that the name is from the qualities of the one named, so ar-Rahmaan (the name) is from rahmah (the quality) that Allaah possesses, and so on. And this is not the case with the creation, for a person might have the name "Aadil (just)" but he is oppressive, and the name "Mahmood (praiseworthy)" but in reality blameworthy. And this view is that of Abu Dawud as-Sijistani and this view contains a refutation of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who claimed Allaah does not have attributes. And this saying also means that the Names of Allaah are from Himself, meaning He is the one who named Himself with them. So upon both these considerations it is said "<b>al-ism <u>min</u> al-musammaa</b>".    <P>
<b><u>The Fourth Position:</u></b> That "<b>al-ism <u>huwa</u> al-musammaa</b>" (the noun or name, is that [entity, thing] which has been named). This was held by the Scholars who came <u>after</u> the leading Imaams of the Salaf, <u>though the majority disliked this saying and spoke against it</u>, and this view is taken by al-Laalikaa'ee and al-Baghawi and Abu Nasr as-Sijzee. However, what they meant was  that when a person calls out a name (ism), say "O Zayd", the noun is not the wording (lafdh) which is "Zayd", but the noun (ism) is what is intended by the wording, meaning, the one that is named (al-musammaa) with that name, which is the self of "Zayd". Here they are not speaking about the definition of ism (noun) in the language but simply <u>what is intended by the use of any noun (ism)</u> - which is simply to refer to the entity named by it. And this is different to what the Ash'aris intended by this saying (we shall see what they say and meant a little later).    <P>
All of these groups who were united in the meaning - despite having these different sayings - made takfeer of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who claimed <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created - because the Salaf knew their saying (al-ism ghayr al-musammaa) followed on from their other saying that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which we have, in letter and word, recited, heard and memorized, is created, and that it was from their saying that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will and power, such that He can name Himself and speak those Names. That is why we have the statements such as those from <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others making takfeer of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and whoever spoke with this view. And as the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (following Ibn Kullaab) share these usool with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <u>that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will and power</u>, which is the basic underlying issue in this whole affair of Allaah's Speech and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and <u>that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, which is the expression of Jibreel, is created</u>, then the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon the same saying, <u>that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created</u>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background Context to the Saying of the Ash'aris In This Issue</font>    <P>
We have to bear in mind a couple of things before we look at the view of the Ash'aris on this subject.     <P>
<u>Recall</u> that they (following the innovation of Ibn Kullaab) hold that Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is only a singular meaning (ma'naa waahid) present with His Self from eternity, that this is uncreated, but that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have consisting of letters, words, which is recited, heard and memorized is created.     <P>
<u>Recall</u> also that they hold Allaah does not speak according to His will and power (al-mashee'ah wal-qudrah) - this is because they <u>outright reject</u> the <a href='../tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> or the <a href='../tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will). What this amounts to in reality is that despite claiming to affirm what they call "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" they do not affirm any "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) for Allaah at all. Rather, the reality is that what the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> call <u>"al-ilm wal-iraadah" (knowledge and  will)</u> - which they  make synonymous with the essence of Allaah - the Ash'aris simply call <u>"<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (a singular indivisible meaning present with Allaah's self)</u> - as has been explained by <a href='../tags/muhammad-saeed-ramadan-al-buti.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan al-Buti</font></a> (<a href=../index2714.html?kiagk>see this article here</a>). And al-Aamidee (7th century Ash'ari) had to admit defeat in not being able to answer the objection that on the issue of Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", the stance they have taken necessitates that they simply treat all the attributes they affirm (the seven) to be synonymous with Allaah's essence (dhaat) which is the the view of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and al-Aamidee (in his book Abkaar ul-Afkaar, 1/400) said he's got no answer for this issue - and this will be discussed in a separate article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<u>Recall</u> also that from their saying is that the letters and words (and languages) are all created, and thus the expression (ibaarah) of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created - meaning that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created, in its letters and words and this is the reality of their saying - they do not deny it and they express this textually in their books, that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, in letter and word, is created - <b>and it is precisely this saying for which the Salaf made takfeer of the Jahmites</b> - and this is manifest and very clear from the sum total of what has been narrated from them.    <P>
<u>Recall</u> also that the Ash'aris reject Allaah's speech is with letter and voice (al-harf was-sawt) <b>and this is something that all factions without exception were united upon (that speech is with letter and voice)</b>, despite their different sayings regarding Allaah's speech (whether it is created or not), up until <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> came and along and until Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> followed them in that. <u>There was actually no dispute about that at all, there was ijmaa' that speech is letter and voice (al-harf was-sawt), and that Allaah speaks with letter and voice</u>. And Abdul-Kareem ash-Shahrastani (d. 584H), one of the important figures of the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> himself writes that Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, in this subject of Allaah's speech (<a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and letter and voice (al-harf was-sawt), that he broke the ijmaa' that existed previously and innovated a third saying not known before. In reality, it was <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and not <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> - but we can look at the saying of ash-Shahrastani (d. 584H) in another article in much detail, it is from his book, "Nihaayat ul-Iqdaam", where he says (p. 177), whilst noting that ash-Shahrastani's statements in characterizing the view of the Salaf are not entirely accurate and precise, but there is enough in what he has said that approximates to what is correct:    <P>

So <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> said, as mentioned by Ibn Abi al-Izz in his Sharh of at-Tahaawiyyah, that al-Juwaynee's view was that what is referred to as Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) is something that shares between a) the meaning that is established with Allaah's self (al-ma'naa al-qaa'imu bidh-dhaat) - which is what the Kullaabis and <a href='../tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> were upon - <u>and</u> b) what Allaah creates in other than Himself of letters, voices (which is what the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said is Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>") - this is because the shrewd ones knew you can't go around saying "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is just the singular meaning (al-ma'naa al-waahid) in the self - it can't be sustained, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah falsify it and it is known, its a matter of ijmaa' that "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) is both meaning (ma'naa) and wording (lafdh) - none of this was disputed until the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> used an unverified line of poetry of a Christian Poet called al-Akhtal as a basis to argue that speech is the "meaning in the self", and then they went looking in the revealed texts for anything that would support them in this. It's a case of "<i>believe first, and find evidence for it afterwards</i>", which is what they did with "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", they (the Kullaabiyyah) innovated this saying of theirs to reconcile between the deen of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and that of Ahl us-Sunnah, and then went looking for evidences for it in the texts.    <P>
And what <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> has done - seeing the falsehood in that - is to simply combine the deen of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, with the deen of <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> by devising a new definition for what is "Kalaamullaah (the speech of Allaah)", and <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> took much of the Kullaabi Ash'arite creed in this direction. <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> said Allaah's speech is just the "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" and the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said, Allaah's speech is what He creates in the servants of speech, and so <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> said, why not just combine between them both so we can have the best of both views in trying to defend that intellectual proof called "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - and <a href='../tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> was responsible for taking  much of the Ash'arite creed back towards the direction of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, in this manner.    <P>
<b>You have to remember why were these people fooling around like this, and what was the driving factor behind it all.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">All of these innovations and sayings and invention of new terms and definitions and so on were with the aim of <u>avoiding the invalidation of the intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" which they made to be the greatest foundation of the religion</u> - so they invent and innovate sayings and play with words and terminologies to hide and conceal the roots of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the bulk of their creed is evidently built upon - because the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were the pioneers of this intellectual  proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", and the Ash'aris inherited it from them - and then they deceive the people by using words and phrases that outwardly seem to be the truth, but inwardly contain the very doctrines of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. <u>And the underlying issue in all of this is that they need to reject and deny that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power - this is what is behind their views on the speech of Allaah in general and following on from that, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and then following on from that, regarding Allaah's Names</u>. This all follows on from their need to negate what they consider to be "hawaadith" (occurrences and events) in order not to falsify that proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" (used to argue for the createdness of the universe), first used by <a href='../tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (ex. 128H), then by the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, being refined and formalized by <a href='../tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (d. 235H), who incorporated the "<a href="../tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" of the Greek Philosopher <a href='../tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (d. 370BC) into it, and then later taken up by al-Baqillani (d. 403H), who refined it further and formalized it for the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> that came after.</font></div>    <P>
From this, you will see why all their sayings (those of the Ash'aris) are simply the branches and twigs that extend from the trunk (<a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>) and the roots (<a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;"> The <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> hold that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, in its letters and words, is created (makhlooq) and by extension, that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> too are created. And to this end they started saying statements such as  "<u>al-ism ghayr al-musammaa</u>", in order to argue for their falsehood. So the Salaf stood to refute them and to clarify the truth. And the position of the Salaf is that all the Names of Allaah are uncreated, and the Names are for Allaah, they belong to Him, He named Himself with them and these Names are as we know them and express them, and we worship Allaah through them, they are uncreated. And the doubt raised by the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (claiming <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created) was just an extension of their saying regarding the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that it is created.</font></div>    <P>
Bear all these things in mind before we look at the saying of the Ash'aris regarding <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, because just like their sayings are deceptive on the issue of Allaah's speech and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then likewise their saying on the issue of <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are also deceptive and other than what they appear to be.    <P>

If are you a bit confused about <a href=../indexf20d.html?hcxqe>twigs and leaves</a>, just follow the previous link and read the article in full (do it later, not now).    <P>
So on the surface, the Ash'aris say that "<i>the Names of Allaah are uncreated</i>" - but because this issue is directly connected to the issue of Allaah's speech and the issue of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then what they intend <u>is very different</u> to what is intended by the Imaams of the Salaf, and the people of the Sunnah, as has preceded from the quotations from <a href='../tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee and others.    <P>
This is why it is important to keep in mind what the saying of the Ash'aris is regarding these two subjects of the speech of Allaah (<a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
<blockquote>They believe that Allaah's speech is only a meaning (ma'naa) that is established with Allaah's Self in eternity. And this meaning is one indivisible meaning, you can't separate out different meanings, it is only one meaning, and that all revealed texts (the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Injeel, Torah, Zabur) are simply created expressions (ibaaraat) of that singular meaning (figure that one out - <u>no one else has in eleven centuries</u>). And as for when Allaah spoke to Moses, He simply gave Moses the faculties through which he could grasp that meaning, not that Allaah spoke directly to Moses. The <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and all revealed texts, in their letters and words, are all created, and that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is simply from the expression (ibaarah) of Jibreel (alayhis salaam) whilst others say of Muhammad (alayhis salaam).</blockquote>    <P>
All of this is aimed at rejecting <u>that Allaah speaks according to His will and power</u> because this according to them, and according to what they inherited from the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of the intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", means that Allaah is subject to occurrences (hawaadith), meaning His actions of speaking when He wills and as He wills, which are actions, and the presence of "action" fulfils the Aristotelian classification of something being a body (jism, jawhar) - <a href=../indexab1a.html?iowfm>thank you</a> <a href='../tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> - and as such this must be rejected for Allaah. And in all of this they are in agreement with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So just like the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> rejected that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, which led them to their saying regarding Allaah's Speech and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that they are created, and to the saying that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created, then likewise, the saying of the Ash'aris, being a mere extension of the usool of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, is also that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created.

<b><u>The Saying of the Ash'aris</u></b>    <P>
The view of the Ash'aris, the early ones amongst them, is that "<b>al-ism <u>ayn</u> ul-musammaa</b>" - which is that the definition of a the ism (noun, name) is that it is <u>the very thing</u> that is named. So instead of a name (ism, i.e. a noun) being an indication, through word (lafdh) and speech (qawl), of that entity which is being named (musammaa), which is what is known to the Arabs, the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> made the name (ism) to be the actual thing being named (musammaa) - meaning that <u>the definition of "ism"</u> which is made up of "alif, seen, meem" is that it refers to the actual essence of something (instead of the name of something). So here we are talking about what is the actual definition of "ism" (noun, name) in the language.     <P>
To clarify this further, the word (lafdh) "Khaalid" which consists of "khaa, alif, laam, daal" is an "ism" (name, noun) that points to and indicates the essence of the person being named with it. So the definition of "ism" is "<u>a word that indicates and points to the musammaa (entity being named)</u>". So what these Ash'aris were saying is that the definition of "ism" (name) is not the word used to identify the thing, but the very thing itself - and this is incorrect, and is opposed to the language of the Arabs.    <P>
To clarify this even further, we can illustrate this with the definitions of "noun" in English, because it is the same in English. So a noun (ism) is:    <P>
<ul><li>A <u>content word</u> that can be used <u>to refer to</u> a person, place, thing, quality, or action  <li><u>The name of</u> an object, concept, person or place  <li>A word used <u>as the name</u> of a thing, quality, or action existing or conceived by the mind  <li>The part of speech used <u>to name</u> a person, place, thing, quality, or action</ul>    <P>
So you can see that the definition of "noun" (ism) is <u>a word or name used <b>to refer to</b> an object</u>. It is not the object itself. The meaning of "ism" (noun) is <u>the name</u> used to refer to the object, and not the object itself, by definition.    <P>
So why did the Ash'aris (some of them) claim that the definition of "ism" (name, noun) is the very thing being named, rather than the word or speech used to refer to that thing? Remember we said earlier that the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> said "<b>al-ism <u>ghayr</u> ul-musammaa</b>" to support their falsehood that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, and they meant here that the Names of Allaah are created because they are from the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is other than Allaah. So the Ash'aris went to the opposite direction (opposing falsehood with falsehood), and said, hey, the definition of "ism" is not the word or speech used to refer to an entity, but the very entity itself.    <P>
They did this to try and prove Allaah himself is not created - <u>which wasn't the actual thing in dispute by the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah</u>. The <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were saying the "Names" of Allaah created, not Allaah Himself is created.     <P>
Some of the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> saw this error and did not support this view and <b>they distinguished between al-ism (the name), al-musammaa (the thing being named), and at-tasmiyyah (the act of naming)</b> - and from them are the likes of <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='../tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) and al-Eejee (d. 756H) discusses it in his al-Mawaaqif (p. 162), and he quotes from ar-Raazee:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/al-eejee-ism-musammaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And the Imaam, ar-Raazee said: "What is well-known from our associates is that al-ism huwa al-musammaa and from the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that [al-ism] is the tasmiyyah, and from <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> that it [al-ism] is diffrent to them both [al-musamma, and at-tasmiyyah]...</blockquote>    <P>
From this we can see the view of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that of the Ash'aris such as al-Bagdhadi (d. 429H), and that of those who came later such as <a href='../tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H), and <a href='../tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), and we have three sayings.     <P>
<ul><li>The saying of the earlier Ash'aris that "al-ism huwa al-musammaa" and what they mean here is that the definition of a noun (ism) is the very entity (being named by it) - and not the word or speech used to refer to it  <li>The saying of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the noun (ism) is the tasmiyyah (the act of designating a word or saying as a name for something)  <li>The saying of the other Ash'aris that all three of ism (noun), musammaa (the entity being named) and tasmiyyah (the act of designating a name for something) are all different.  </ul>    <P>
<b><u>Taking a Closer Look at the Ash'aris Saying the "Ism" is the "Musammaa"</u></b>    <P>
But let's take a look at a saying of those who supported the view that "<b>al-ism <u>ayn</u> al-musammaa</b>". Abu Mansur Abdul-Qahir al-Baghdadi (d. 429H) in his "Usool ud-Din" says (pp. 116-117):    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/al-baghdadi-ism-musammaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>The First Issue in This Foundation: Regarding the Meaning of al-Ism and Its Reality</b>    <P>
They differed regarding al-ism (the noun). The majority of our associates said  that is is the thing being named (al-musammaa), but that the expressions of it are appellations (tasmiyyaat) for it. And Abu al-Hasan <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> has textually stated this saying in "Kitaab Tafseer al-Qur'an". And he mentioned in  "Kitaab us-Sifaat" that the noun (al-ism) is the attribute (as-sifah), and he categorized it in the manner of the categorization of the attributes.     <P>
And the Qadariyyah [meaning the Mu'tazilah] claimed that al-ism is other than the actual entity being named (al-musammaa), and they referred by it to a saying which our companions have called "at-tasmiyyah".</blockquote>    <P>
This means here that the definition of al-ism (the noun, the name) is "the very entity being named (al-musammaa)" rather than the word or speech used to refer to the entity. So this would mean, that the name "Allaah" in Arabic "alif, laam, laam, haa", as a noun, in and of itself, is the actual Essence (of Allaah) - instead of a word that refers to and points to Allaah's Essence.    <P>
However, when it was argued against them that Allaah has multiple names and not just the name "Allaah" - which they could not answer - they then said, that all the multiple names, the "<a href="../tags/asmaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Asmaa</font></a>", are in fact "Tasmiyyaat", and the "Tasmiyyaat" are created. And Tasmiyyah, means the act of naming, giving something a name, designating a name to something, and here they simply agree with the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that all the Names of Allaah are Tasmiyyaat (which are created).    <P>
Al-Baghdadi says (p. 117):    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/al-baghdadi-ism-musammaa-2.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And because the one who said from the Qadariyyah [meaning, the Mu'tazilah] that the name is other than the named (al-ism ghayral-musammaa), then it becomes necessary upon his principle that Allaah does not have any name or attribute from eternity, because the names and descriptions, to him (the Mu'tazili) are tasmiyyaat (appellations) and ibaaraat (expressions), and nothing from them are eternal upon their saying. </blockquote>    <P>
He means here that the view of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is that the Names of Allaah are tasmiyyaat and ibaaraat (meaning, created expressions and appellations) and that these are not eternal.

And then after saying that if there is not any name or attribute from eternity, then this is merely the description of a non-existing thing. Then he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>... And if they then ask us about His saying, "<b>To Allaah belong the Most Beautiful Names</b>", we say that He intended by "al-Asmaa" (Names) the "Tasmiyyaat", meaning the appellations (designating of Names for Him). So the intent behind it is the "Tasmiyyaat", because numerousness (al-'adad) relates to this (the multiplicity of tasmiyyaat) and not to the single entity (being named).</blockquote>    <P>
And here he is saying that the multiple <a href='../tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a> (Names) are in fact the Tasmiyyaat - the designating of Names for Allaah, which are those created expressions which are made up of letters and used to refer to Allaah. The Ash'aris believe Allaah does not speak according to His will and power, and Allaah does not speak as and when He wills, and as such Allaah did not speak the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with letter and word, and as such what we know and utter of the Names of Allaah (ar-Rahmaan, ar-Raheem, al-Malik and so on) are not "<a href="../tags/asmaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Asmaa</font></a>" (names), but "Tasmiyyaat" - and these are created.    <P>
To get an idea of what is going it, its probably useful to bring out a diagram:    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/ism-musammaa.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said that the Names are the "Tasmiyyaat" (acts of naming something with something, or designating a name for something) - which to them are created. Recall that to the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which we have is created. So they treated <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> just like they treated the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and Allaah's speech as being something that Allaah creates in other entities. So their view on this was "<u>the ism is the tasmiyyah</u>" meaning, that Allaah's Name is "the act of naming by the servants", and as Allaah creates speech in people, then tasmiyyah becomes something created, so when a person says "ar-Rahmaan", Allah created that act in that person who said this, and thus Allaah's Name (ism) is the action of expressing the name (tasmiyyah) and referring to Allaah by it, this being created. This follows on from their saying regarding Allaah's Speech and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.     <P>
Now, the Ash'aris in order to oppose this view, they decided to say, "<u>the ism is the musamma</u>" (the name is the very thing being named), because they wanted to argue through this that Allaah is not created. However, this was not actually in dispute, the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> do not claim Allaah is created, they claimed <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created. But despite saying "<u>the ism is the musamma</u>", meaning the noun or name, by definition,  is the very thing being named, and not the word or saying that is used to refer to the thing, they still held that the tasmiyyah (act of designating a name for something) is created - they had to because it follows on from their saying that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which we have, in letter and word, the expression (ibaarah) of Allaah's "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", is created. So when a servant says, "ar-Rahmaan" for example, this is the created expression, and as such what is taking place here is that it is the servant who is doing the tasmiyyah (the act of designating this name for Allaah and referring to Allaah by it), and this is created. Because to them, Allaah did not speak with His will and power and with letter and word.    <P>
<b>The outcome of all this is that irrespective of whether the Ash'aris say that the definition of ism (noun, name) is the very thing being named, or other than the thing being named, their viewpoint regarding the Names is the same as the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which is that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are "Tasmiyyaat" and are created.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Summary</b>    <P>
Ahl us-Sunnah hold, following on from their belief that Allaah has always been "one who speaks" (mutakallim) and in addition to that, He speaks when He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills, because <u>He has actions tied to His will and power</u>, and included within this is <u>His Speech</u>, He can speak as He wishes. And that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from His knowledge, meaning that He knew from eternity what would be in the revealed <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and that Allaah spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as and when He willed, and His speech of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was with letter and voice, and thus the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, in letter and word, is the uncreated speech of Allaah. They do not hold that Allaah spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in eternity, once only, without succession or sequence of its contents - Ahl us-Sunnah do not hold that, this is the innovation of <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and company, and none of the Salaf held this, it is an innovated saying of the people of <a href='../tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> - they had to innovate this in light of their intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", to protect it and avoid invalidating it. But following on from what Ahl us-Sunnah hold, they say <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are therefore, uncreated. They are not something expressed initially by any created being, they are Names Allaah named Himself which He revealed to His creation, and they are His real names, as He named Himself. The saying that they are uncreated follows on from the saying that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, in letter and word, which is recited, heard and memorized, is uncreated - and we do not mean here that the ink, paper, and voice are uncreated, we mean the letters and words that they represent, which are uncreated. And all of this follows on from the saying that Allaah's speech is uncreated, whilst noting that it is the ijmaa' of the Arabs that "<a href="../tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is both meaning (ma'naa) and wording (lafdh) - and the first to innovate "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" was <a href='../tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, and <a href='../tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took this from the Kullaabis of Bagdhadh, and it became the saying of the <a href='../tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
However, as the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> do not believe that Allaah has actions tied to his will - this would invalidate their intellectual proof of "<a href="../tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" as it would mean to them Allaah is subject to occurrences (hawaadith) - and because they've just argued against the Atheists that the bodies making up the univeres are created precisely because they are subject to events then they cannot accept that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, from which is His speech.    <P>
So following on from this, <a href='../tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> (ex. 128H) said Allaah did not speak to Moses, and that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. The <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And the <a href='../tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, in letter and word, recited, heard, and memorized is created (agreeing with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) but that there is something called "<a href="../tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" that is not created. In reality this was the same as what the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> called "ilm" (knowledge) and "iraadah" (will) that are both synonymous with Allaah's Essence in the view of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. And in keeping with their saying that the Qur'aan is created, it followed that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> too are created. Why, because they believe Allaah never spoke the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in letter and word, because He is not able to speak when He wills, however He wills as this would mean "hulool ul-hawaadith" (the taking place of events), meaning actions in His Essence, which would invalidate their proof for demonstrating the createdness of the universe.    <P>
And the Jamiyyah started raising this saying, "<b>al-ism <u>ghayr</u> ul-musammaa</b>" in order to deceive the people and to claim <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created, something they were saying anyway by saying that the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon the same thing. And the Ash'aris, the earlier ones, tried to oppose the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by bringing a futile, innovated saying, "<b>al-ism <u>ayn</u> ul-musammaa</b>" which was pointless and in vain, and which the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> recognized as futile - in fact <a href='../tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> himself set out to refute it in detail (but by using ilm ul-kalaam) - and so the <a href='../tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> distinguished between the "ism", the "musammaa" and the "tasmiyyah" - and after all that fooling around of the earlier Ash'aris, their view nevertheless, was exactly the same as that of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that <a href='../tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> are created - by virtue of their saying that this <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, in letter and word, recited, heard and memorized, is created - and this is the saying on account of which the Salaf made takfeer of the <a href='../tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.</div>    <P>
