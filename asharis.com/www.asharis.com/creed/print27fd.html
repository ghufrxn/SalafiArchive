<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>After providing a framework in <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>Part 1</a> of all the various factions (eleven in total), and then presenting the position of [<u>Ahl al-Sunnah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></u> and early followers and <u><a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></u> and early followers] on the subject of 'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> in <a href=index3639.html?emuan>Part 2</a>, we are now in position to start looking at the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, proper, as in, those who are fundamentally <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Tools</font>    <P>
We ought to disclose our tools first of all, and here they are, they are made of <u>rubberwood</u>, our preference. It gets the job done and maintains its shiny surface even with the most stubborn cases. Cleaning is a breeze.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baseball-bats.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
As you can see, each piece in the collection has a specific purpose and is used for a specific task. In a field of neo-Jahmites charged up with centuries of calculated deception, you need to be well-equipped. Rehabilitation won't take place just yet. We are done with the <u>first</u> tool (building the framework, <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>finished here in Part 1</a>), and we are currently using the <u>second</u> and <u>third</u> (establishing fact and gradually building context, we already did some in <a href=index3639.html?emuan>Part 2</a>), and will remain doing so for a few articles more. When you start hearing effeminate screams and shouts [from the <i>makhaaneeth</i> of the Jahmiyyah], you'll know the <u>fourth</u> has swung into action in smashing their doubts for which they (the makhaaneeth) will be wailing and screaming. <b>Please note:</b> This is all <i>majaaz</i>, don't take it upon its <i>haqeeqah</i>, it is purely a figure of speech and is for <u>education purposes</u> only.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Sources of Information</font>    <P>
We are going to rely upon these books:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/farq-bayn-al-firaq.gif border=1 border=0>  <img src=assets/images/baghdadi-usul-al-din.gif border=1 border=0>  <img src=assets/images/ashari-maqalat-islamiyyin.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
They are two books of <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H) an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar, <i><b>Usul al-Din</b></i> and <i><b>al-Farq bayn al-Firaq</b></i>, and Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari's (d. 324H) <i><b>Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen</b></i>. You can refer to the relevant entries in all these books under the Raafidah, and under the section on the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>. Rather than provide full translations of entire passages, we are going to provide summary statements which will be exact translations of sentences in any case.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>An important thing you have to keep in mind here, is that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself affirmed in this book, <b><i>al-Maqaalat</i></b>, the creed of the people of hadith and aathaar of affirming the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (face, hands, eyes, istiwaa)  and 'uluww for Allaah, and states that he speaks with all of that. Just as <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> affirmed in his book <i><b>Usul al-Din</b></i> that from the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (meaning <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his earliest associates) were those who affirmed al-'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah. This is also acknowledged by <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>, al-Qushayree, and <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> affirmed face, hands, eye, asserting that these are definitely attributes of the essence, because it is impossible to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of all of the texts mentioning them, the wording simply makes it impossible. So he affirmed these attributes, claimed that these specific texts cannot admit to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, even if others can, given their context. You have to keep this in mind because it is a significant and crucial matter, and it will help you to reproduce what is going on in their minds as what is and what is not <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih and how they perceived and characterized the various factions and sects and their views. The allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> made by the pseudo-Ashari neo-Jahmites relies upon your ignorance of  history and what is found in the books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>. If you don't wisen up a little you'll remain nothing but a plaything for your devious pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmi figureheads.</blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Paths of the Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> Have the Same Base and Origin</font>    <P>
This is something the leaders of the pseudo-Ash'ari neo-Jahmites want to keep from you [their follower, who aspires to follow what he thinks is the way of al-Ash'ari]. It's easy for them, because people like you don't go and read the books for yourself and nor do you study history objectively. The swindle therefore is made easier, its a doddle, and your Kellers, GF Haddads, Abul Hasans and their likes couldn't have it easier. So lets reveal this little secret and blow the lid off it.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>First, a primer</b>. You should know that the <u>Khawaarij</u> who make takfir of the sinner and the <u>Murji'ah</u> who claim the believer is perfect in his eemaan even in the presence of sin, that <u>their innovations are founded upon the same principle</u>. This principle is that:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Eemaan (faith) is a single indivisible entity</b>.</blockquote>     <P>
From this principle, the Khawaarij said, "<i>If some of it goes, it all of it has to go [since it is one whole entity and something can't remain behind</i>" and the Murji'ah said, "<i>As it is a single entity, then none of it goes, all of it must remain</i>." So in this manner, they proceeded in different directions after being united on the foundational principle and they went to opposite extremes from the same starting point. So the Khawaarij said that whoever fell into sin, lost something of his eemaan has in fact lost the whole lot and is therefore a kaafir. The Murji'ah said whoever fell into sin, small or large, few or abundant, lost nothing of his eemaan and he remains a perfect in faith believer. </div>    <P>
Now that you have grasped that, then you should know for sure that the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are divided into two. <u>The Mu'attilah</u> (the deniers of Allaah being a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> and having attributes and actions, or something from them) and <u>the Mujassimah</u> (those claiming Allaah is a jism). The first to say Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> is <u><a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a></u>, the Imam of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>. And the first to say Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> are the Rafidi <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, in particular <u>Hisham bin al-Hakam al-Kufi</u>, the Rafidi Mutakallim, the Imam of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>. And both of these views are founded upon the same underlying foundations. Yes, it is none other than the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>. As we shall see with the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, they were also led to <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> upon this same proof.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'> <b>Brief Outline of the Proof</b>    <P>
The proof tries to establish the universe is originated and hence the existence of a creator. The argument is:    <P>
<blockquote><b>a)</b> that everything in the universe is body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (indivisible particle) or incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) <b>b)</b> that incidental attributes definitely exist (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) like color, taste, smell, motion, rest, combination, separation, breadth, width, height, texture and so on to all possible attributes of things and their opposites <b>c)</b> that these <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> are therefore originated, that is they are events (hawaadith) that came to be (because they cannot exist on their own) <b>d)</b> that bodies (ajsaam) that make up the universe are never devoid of these incidental attributes (which are hawaadith, events), they never precede them, and they are never separate from them (meaning no body in the universe is absent the genus of incidental attributes, it must have something from them, and thus every body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) has hawaadith) <b>e)</b> and upon the principle that whatever is not devoid of, absent, or prior to hawaadith, must itself be <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>, originated <b>f)</b> Hence, all bodies in the universe are originated <b>g)</b> And because whatever is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated) must have a muhdith (originator), then Allaah exists.</blockquote>    <P>
This is the core of it and all of these are its basic premises and all of these groups are united upon its basic premises. Note that premise <b>e)</b> is the greatest foundation of the Mu'attilah, it is the foundation of <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, its chief and master, and it is the basis for all of his <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>. and this premise is uniform for all the Mu'attilah, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> amongst them (Hanafi Karraamiyyah). And as for <b>g)</b>, it is a sound priciple mentioned in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and known through fitrah and reason. The major portion of the time, effort and resources spent by the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> was on <b>a)</b> to <b>e)</b> and you will see this manifest in the books of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>.  </div>    <P>
<b>As for the Mu'attilah amongst them:</b>     <P>
<blockquote>The <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Maturidiyyah</u>. They used this proof to prove the universe is originated and to prove Allaah's existence, and then in order to remain consistent with it, they denied Allaah's attributes and actions, in order to not liken Him to created bodies, as they claimed. Otherwise the proof would be invalidated. Hence, you will understand their theological language, "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, has no spatial dimension, is not above, not below, is not in place, is not in direction, is not in spatial occupation, is not within the universe, or outside the universe, is not in contact with things, or separate from things, is not distant from [anything] or near to [anything]</i>..." and so on.  These people considered a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) to  mean whatever accepts <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events) and whatever is composed. Hence, these particular negations of theirs and why they denied the attributes and actions (to varying degrees).</blockquote>    <P>
<b>As for the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> amongst them:</b>     <P>
<blockquote>The <u>Rafidi Mujassimah</u>, <u>Hanafi Karraamiyyah</u>. They also used this proof to prove the universe is originated and to prove Allaah's existence, and they said that since only bodies and their incidental attributes exist and since it is impossible for Allaah to be from the incidental attributes [which can never exist on their own] then He must be a body. To remain consistent with the revealed texts in affirmation of attributes and actions, they said Allaah must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> in order to possess attributes.  These <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> said that <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) means "that which exists (<i>mawjud</i>)" and "that which is self-established (<i>qaa'imun bi nafsihi</i>)" as <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> documents about them in his <i>al-Maqaalaat</i>. Then they said (the Raafidees) "<i>Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, he has length, breadth, width </i>...." and the rest of it you will see in what follows when we document their views in detail. You will see their language more or less opposite to that of the Mu'attilah. One thing to note about these <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> is that some of them inherited something of the gross tashbih of their ancestors who had deified Ali (radiallaahu anhu) and others, and thus that gross language of tashbih was mixed into their <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> resulting from their <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and you will see this manifest when you read their beliefs in the next article inshaa'Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
Both these groups are operating upon <u>the same platform</u> and from <u>the same starting point</u>, but moving to different conclusions. When this becomes clear to you, and you start on your journey of investigation, and choose to no longer remain an ignoramus whose mind is a plaything for academic fraudsters and shysters from the <i>makhaaneeth</i> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the pseudo-Ash'ari neo-Jahmi swindle should start to unravel somewhat.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This now has set the context and scene for discussing the Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, both of whom are <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, along with their associates from the Mu'attilah. Inshaa'Allaah, this will be covered in the next couple of parts.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Crucial Point: All Of These People are <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> in the Theoretical Foundations Of Their Theology</font>    <P>
Before we move on to the next article, it is crucial to understand that the Mu'attilah, like the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> both fall into tashbih (resemblance) in their theoretical foundations, and this is explained as follows.     <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">They made Allaah subject to the same lawaazim (binding necessities) as those applicable to His creation after having made three types of false analogy for Allaah (these are similar, overlap and are different ways of saying what essentially amounts to the same thing). These are <i>qiyas al-shumul</i> (analogy by inclusion), <i>qiyas al-ghaa'ib alaa al-shaahid</i> (analogy for the unseen with the seen), <i>qiyas al-tamthil</i> (analogy of likeness). The conclusions of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam are founded upon these analogies. To illustrate, anything in the creation about which we say is "<i>above</i>" then that would necessitate it is in a direction, occupying a created space [as it is within the universe] and hence a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body. They then <u>extended this necessity</u> and included Allaah within the genus of created things for whom such necessities are binding. Hence, if it is said about Allaah "above", it necessitates he must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) too. However, Allaah's essence is unknowable and is unlike all other essences. Yet, in order to build the language of their theology (a series of negations), they have to include Allaah within the genus of created bodies so that they can apply the lawaazim that pertain to them (the created bodies) to Allaah Himself. It is from <u>this starting point</u> that the very language of their theism [how they describe Allaah] is conceived. So they are operating upon false analogies in the very theological foundations of their theology and hence, they are the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> in truth. They do not really fathom the saying of Allaah, "<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>" (42:11), and this falsifies all of these analogies. Since Allaah is unlike the created bodies, then the necessities applying to them cannot apply to Him, such that your whole theology should be founded upon such theoretical considerations.     <P>
From this you will see how their minds have been led astray, because when a Sunni Muthabbit of sound mind and constitution says what Allah and His Messenger said, "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>", they say, "<i>You have rendered Allaah a body</i>." So here, he has applied the necessity which applies to created bodies to Allaah Himself, which means he has <u>included Allaah in the genus of things</u> about which if it is said, "above", it must be a body. So this is tashbih and tamthil, the very thing they are trying to flee from, but which is rooted in the very theoretical foundations of their speech. Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf and their followers, who have sound, uncorrupted minds (because they are not intoxicated with that kalaam), they say, "<i>Allah is above the Throne</i>" and they see no falsehood in this meaning at all, because they know there is nothing like unto Allaah, so these false analogies are invalidated, and hence no such [false] necessities apply, such that the realities of the creation can be imposed upon Him. </font></blockquote>    <P>
Hence, after falling into this <u>theoretical foundational tashbih</u> these two factions (Mu'attilah, Mujassimah) took two different routes. The Mu'attilah saw the conclusions arising from these theoretical foundations to be repugnant in their souls. So they denied names, attributes and actions from Allaah (upon the differences between them) and claimed they were making tanzih and that this is <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>. The <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> followed through with the conclusions required by these theoretical foundations and simply made tashbih in describing their Lord, and they believed they were wholly consistent and that this is what the truth requires of them, otherwise they will not have affirmed a Lord.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>What this essentially shows is that the underlying foundation, the proof itself, huduth al-ajsaam, is baatil (futile, false) and faasid (corrupt), both shar'an and aqlan (legislatively and rationally), and it is in need of futile analogies for Allah for it to have any plausibility or justification.</b></div>    <P>
As for Ahl al-Sunnah, followers of revealed Books and sent Messengers, those who restrict themselves to the speech of Allaah, His Messenger and the Righteous Salaf, then they know that there is nothing like Allaah, and as a result such type of theological speech about Allaah is false. They affirm what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him whilst negating tamthil and takyif and know for sure that none of the lawaazim that related to created beings apply to Allaah, the Exalted, in His names, attributes and actions. Hence, they are the soundest in creed, firmest in faith, and of sound mind and constitution. Unlike the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> for they are a confused, unsure, unstable, insecure people, and you will understand:    <P>
<blockquote>The saying of Abu Yusuf, the companion of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, "<i>Whoever sought his religion through kal&#257;m will fall into heresy</i>", and the saying of al-Shaafi'ee, "<i>Whoever entered into kal&#257;m never prospered</i>," and likewise the saying of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, "<i>Whoever takes to kal&#257;m will never prosper and whoever takes to kal&#257;m will not escape from tajahhum (adopting the &#363;s&#363;l of the Jahmiyyah)</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
For this reason, when you speak to these Ash'aris, Maturidis and their likes, they are the most intellectualy insecure people, prone to doubts, fickle, struggling to find psychological comfort for the spider's web they have built (the weakest of structures), and thus, reject plain truth and plain reason when it stares them in the face.    <P>
