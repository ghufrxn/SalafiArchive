We have already established in numerous articles that the distinction between <b>Tawhid al-Ruboobiyyah</b> and <b><a href='tags/tawhid-al-ibaadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-Ibaadah</font></a></b> was not invented by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and nor Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab but it is something that is plain and manifest in the Book of Allaah and there is found in the writings of Scholars  who preceded <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab by centuries that which indicates the reality of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers.   <u>From those articles:</u> <b>Fakhr ud-Din <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H)</b>: The Grave Worshippers Who Seek <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> Are Equivalent to the Idol Worshippers Who Seek <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> - (<a href=index0631.html?zvqna>see here</a>). <b>Abu Bakr <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 406H)</b>: Distinguishes Between Ruboobiyyah and Uloohiyyah and Explains the Kalimah as None Has <u>the Right</u> to be Worshipped but Allaah Alone - (<a href=index5afe.html?sortp>see here</a>). <b>Ibn Aqeel Al-Hanbali (d. 531H)</b>: On Making Tawassul to Allaah Through the Dead by Addressing the Dead With Invocation -  (<a href=http://www.wahhabis.com/?yuitd>see here</a>). <b>Ahmad Bin Ali al-Maqrizi al-Shafi'i (d. 845H)</b>: On <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, Shirk, Rububiyyah, Uluhiyyah, <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> - (<a href=http://www.wahhabis.com/?asnof>see here</a>)  </blockquote></div>    <P>

<img src=assets/images/shahrastani-nihayah-cov.gif style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" align="right" border="1" border=0> To the right is a book "<i>Niyaahat ul-Iqdaam Fee Ilm al-Kalaam</i>" by the 6th century <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar <b>Abd al-Kareem al-Shahrastani</b> (d. 548H) - (Maktabah al-Thaqafah al-Deeniyyah, Cairo. 1430H). The book comprises the explanation of twenty principles and starts off with the standard treatment of the cosmological argument, huduth al-ajsaam  (origination of bodies) which the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> founded their religion upon and on account of which they  denied the names, attributes and actions (to varying degrees) and assaulted the revealed texts through <i>tahreef</i> (distortion) in the name of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>. You can learn more about that by following our systematic deconstruction of standard <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi curriculum <a href=index7b25.html?moitybx>starting here</a>. We have an interesting passage that relates to the issue of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and it will augment and support our previous articles (indicated earlier) establishing that the call to <a href='tags/tawhid-al-uluhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah</font></a> (or <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Ibadah) as distinct  from affirmation of mere Rububiyyah is not the invention or fabrication of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> or Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab. Let us see this passage and make the relevant comments upon it:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Tawhid and Shirk and The Point of Dispute Between the Messengers and Those to Whom They Were Sent</font>    <P>
This passage occurs under the discussion of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (negation, divestment) and it is between pages 121-122:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shahrastani-nihayah-122.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for denying the knowing, able, wise creator for the universe, then I have not observed this as the statement of anyone. Nor do I know any person holding a statement to be upon this (view) except what is cited from a small faction of materialist atheists, that they said: The universe was in distributed parts in eternity, without having any arrangement (order) then it shook, knocking together and through it the universe that you see in its current form took place. Then the orbital bodies took (spherical) shape and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> things came to be. But I do not consider the person holding this statement to be from those who deny a creator. Rather, he acknowledges a creator but he attributes the cause of the existence of the universe (as it currently is) to chance and coincidence so as to avoid affirming an actual cause. So I did not consider this issue from the theories for which an evidence can be established. For sound, innate human disposition bears witness to a knowing, powerful creator by necessity of its innate disposition and most elementary thinking, "<b>Is there any doubt concerning Allaah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth?</b>" ((14:10), <b>"And if you were to ask them who created them, they will surely say, 'Allaah'.</b>" (43:87), "<b>And if you were to ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say Allaah, the all-Mighty and all-Knowing created them</b>" (43:8).    <P>
But (rather) they became heedless of (what) this innate disposition (necessitated from them) in the period of happiness (prosperity), for there is no doubt that they seek recourse (refuge) with Him in the time of hardship (calamity), "<b>They invoke Allaah, making worship (deen) purely and sincerely for Him alone</b>" (10:22), "<b>And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah alone)</b>" (17:67). For this reason, the obligation (takleef) did not come as (merely) having knowledge of the existence of the creator, rather it came as knowing <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and negating (any) partner(s) [in worship], "<i>I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah'</i>." And for this reason the point of contention between the Messengers and the creation was made with respect to <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, "<b>That is when Allah alone is invoked you disbelieved and if partners are associated with Him you believe</b>" (40:12), "<b>And when Allah Alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust</b>" (39:45), "<b>And when you make mention of your Lord alone in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> [as worthy of worship], they turn on their backs, fleeing in extreme dislikeness</b>." (17:46)  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Comments and Notes</font>    <P>
In the above citation, <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> establishes that no one up until his time, not even the Dahriyyah (materalists) denied a creator in principle, and that the affirmation of a creator that is knowing and powerful is a matter rooted in the fitrah (innate disposition). This is the Ruboobiyyah that is rooted in the souls. After establishing this through verses of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and through the verbal affirmation of the Mushriks to whom the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent, he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>But (rather) they became heedless of (what) this innate disposition (necessitated from them) in the period of happiness (prosperity), for there is no doubt that they seek recourse (refuge) with Him in the time of hardship (calamity)</blockquote>    <P>
And here he has produced the argument in the Book of Allaah the Exalted, and that which is found in the writings of Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab around 6-7 centuries later, that affirmation of Ruboobiyyah necessitates singling out Allaah in his Uloohiyyah (sole right to be worshipped), that the latter is binding from the affirmation of the former by necessity. <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> then cites part of the verse which in full is as follows:    <P>

Meaning that the obligation was not to come to know Allaah is the creator, unique in His actions of creating, owning, providing, giving life, taking life, providing benefit and removing harm, since all of that is fitriyy (innate knowledge) but it was to know <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (of worship) and negate  partners from Him in that worship. Then he  cites a number of verses which make mention of the issue of da'wah (invocation, calling, supplicating) and that those who worship other deities are repulsed and become averse when only Allaah is mentioned and asked to be invoked alone.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
What you have here essentially is the core elements of the introduction of the treatise <i>Kashf al-Shubuhaat</i> of Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab and it is similar to what is found in the writings of <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a> as we have discussed in more detail in the article, <b>Fakhr ud-Din <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) : The Grave Worshippers Who Seek <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> Are Equivalent to the Idol Worshippers Who Seek Intercession</b> (<a href=index0631.html?zvqna>see here</a>). The above information has <u>extremely serious implications</u> for todays <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> many of whom are steeped in what <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> (d. 548H) indicated here of a people invoking and seeking refuge in other than Allaah in times of ease (nay, the contemporaries invoke their deities in hardship too), and he preceded <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (d. 728H) and Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (d. 1175H) in this notification by many centuries.    <P>
We ask Allaah on this blessed <a href='tags/day-of-arafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Day of Arafah</font></a>, in the month of Dhul-Hijjah, 1434H to guide those misguided Ash'aris and Maturidis whose language of <b>Aristotelian Tawhid</b> has blinded them from truly understanding the reality of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers, even though its understanding can be found littered in some of the writings and statements of their very own Scholars in past history.    <P>

The essence of what is in these articles (all quotes from ar-Razi's tafsir) is the nature of idol-worship is the seeking <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> from the heavenly-spirits, angels, prophets, jinn, the righteous dead by offering worship to "focal-points" which are often statues or representations and which include the graves and tombs of the righteous dead, however it is not these "focal-points" that are the object of worship, the worship is really for the heavenly-spirits, angels, prophets, jinn and the righteous dead. These are venerated and worshipped with a view to winning their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>. And <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> considers all of this to be Shirk (associationism) and idol-worship. We can summarize the articles with the following:    <P>
We have established previously that <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar of the 6th and early 7th centuries, affirmed: <b>a)</b> That <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> (<a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>) belongs to none but Allaah alone, and <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> can never take place except with Allah's permission - (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?pqwqp>see this article</a>),  <b>b)</b> That du'a (supplication) is the loftiest of the stations of al-ubudiyyah (servitude, worship), is the  most excellent of the types of worship, and the reality of du'a is such that incorporates other forms of worship such as humility (dhull), servitude (uboodiyyah), incapacity (inkisaar), poverty, need (maskanah) - (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?asmag>see this article</a>), <b>c)</b> That none of the pagans ever intended to worship the statues or idols, rather the acts of worship they performed were directed to those in the graves, and their reason was that they were intending to solicit their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> - (see <a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?fgnbc>this article</a> and <a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?pqwqp>this article</a>), <b>d)</b> That many were found in the time of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> who flocked to the graves and venerated them with the desire of soliciting the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of the righteous dead - (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?qhxzs>see here</a>), <b>e)</b> That no nation in history ever believed in Ruboobiyyah for other than Allaah (with an exception for the Dualists) and that none of those who worship other than Allaah believe that what they worship has any independent power or control. And that what actually led people to worship things were certain philosophical and other reasons and from them were the soliciting of the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> the pious, righteous dead. And further, that whatever they took as focal points of worship (pictures, idols, statues, graves, tombs) were never intended for worship at all, rather they were simply focal points to allow the direction of worship to the righteous dead - (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?ebzse>see here</a>), <b>f)</b> That whoever solicited and requested <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> from other than Allaah, has relinquished the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> for Himself and invalidated it for himself - (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/?pmtvz>see here</a>).    <P>
