<font class='titleHeadline'>Background Information</font>    <P>
We have established in the articles on this website with sufficient proof that what is known today as the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab is in fact a hybrid of the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, and historically, what was known as the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab, was simply a relabeling and popularization of the Kullaabi creed with the label of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>", through Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, after his abandonment of the creed of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. However, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> began hybridizing this original creed, due to their inability to satisfactorily resolve issues raised against aspects of their creed.    <P>
The origins of all of these deviant creeds lie in an intellectual proof called "<i><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></i>" on account of which the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u> denied all names, descriptions, attributes and actions for Allaah, and the <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u> affirmed the names on the surface, and denied the attributes and actions, and the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u> were the first of the Mutakallimeen to affirm something of the attributes, whilst denying the actions of Allaah (being tied to His will and power). This became <u>the hallmark</u> of the Kullaabi doctrine, namely rejection of those attributes tied to Allaah's will and power (al-istiwaa, an-nuzool, al-mahabbah, al-ghadab and so on), upon the argument that they would necessitate that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), being subject to accidents, incidental attributes (a'raad, hawaadith). Alongside this, they affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a> (attributes of the essence), such as Face, Hands, Eyes, and also affirmed Allaah being above His creation, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence. This was the Kullaabi doctrine that took on the name of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>".    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>However, from the 5th century onwards, the prominent <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> starting mainly from <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), then <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), and then <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H), they started a process that led to <u>the hybridization</u> of that early Kullaabi-Ash'ari doctrine with the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and that's pretty much what today's <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> are upon, with most of them utterly heedless of these facts.</div>    <P>
Since this creed of the Mutakallimeen in general (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), as it relates to Tawhid, <u>is centered only around establishing the existence of a creator</u> - then as knowledge waned over the centuries, and ignorance set in, it was amongst these very people that deviation in <u>the very core of Tawhid</u> emerged. This occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries (after the hijrah). As for the earlier Scholars amongst the Ash'aris then despite their deviation in aspects of the creed (names and attributes, al-qadar, al-eemaan and so on), they were clear on the very foundations of Tawhid, meaning that which the Messengers came to establish, which was Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah, or Tawhid al-Ibaadah.    <P>
In this article we will establish this, from the most important figure in the actual formalization of the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab, al-Qaadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillaani on Tawhid, and in Particular Tawhid al-Ibaadah, Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/al-baqillani-insaaf-cover-small.gif align=right border=1 hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> Al-Baqillani is the one who can be credited with formalizing the As'hari madhhab through his works, in particular <i>at-Tamheed</i> and also <i>al-Insaaaf</i>. What he laid down in these books became the foundations of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>". As we stated earlier, these <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> had a grounding in the understanding and presentation of Tawhid which the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> did not maintain (in the 7th, 8th centuries). Today's hybridized Jahmiyyah-Mu'tazilah-Kullaabiyyah posing as Ash'aris and taking on the banner of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" attack the classical understanding of Tawhid, which is that Tawhid is to single out Allah in his right of worship (ibaadah), after singling Him out in his Lordship (ruboobiyyah), the <u>former</u>, being an inevitable consequence of the <u>latter</u>, with this being the Qur'anic reasoning against the calling upon others besides or alongside Allaah. Today's Ash'aris scorn the classification of Tawhid in this manner (Ruboobiyyah, Uloohiyyah and al-Asmaa was-Sifaat), claiming it is an innovation of the later times.    <P>
Al-Baqillani writes in al-Insaf (p. 22)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baqillani-uloohiyyah-2.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And faith (al-eemaan) in Allaah, the Exalted comprises <b>making Tawhid for Him</b>, the Sublime (i.e. singling Him out), and describing Him with His Attributes, and negating shortcomings from Him which [otherwise] indicate the createdness of the one upon whom these shortcomings are permissible.    <P>
And "<b>making Tawhid for Him</b>" is: Affirming that He is established, existing, and one ilaah (deity), single, worshipped (ma'bood), there being no likeness unto Him, upon what is established by His saying, the Exalted, "<b>And your ilaah (deity) is a single (deity), there is none which has the right to be worshipped except He, the One full of mercy, Merciful (to His servants)</b>" (Baqarah 2:163), and His saying, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b>" (ash-Shura 42:11).</blockquote>    <P>
And he writes (p. 32)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baqillani-uloohiyyah.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Issue: And it is obligatory to know that the creator of the universe, lofty is His power, is one (waahid) unique (ahad). And the meaning of that is: That there is not with Him an ilaah besides Him, <b>and nor anyone who has the right of worship, except Him alone</b>. And <u>we do not mean by that</u>, that He is "one" (waahid) <u>from the angle of number</u>, and likewise [we do not mean the aforementioned through] our saying "unique"  (ahad), and existing, singular. Rather, we intend by it that there is nothing resembling [Him] (shabeeh) and nor any aider, supporter (dhaheer). And we intend by that, <b>that there is none alongside Him that deserves [the right] of ilaahiyyah</b>  besides Him, and Allaah, the Exalted said, "<b>Indeed Allaah is a single ilaah (deity)</b>" (an-Nisa 4/171), and its meaning is "<i>There is none which has the right to be worshipped except Allaah (alone)</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
In the above two statements, al-Baqillani, has explained Tawhid in a manner in which it is essentially summarized and brought together in accordance with three categories of Tawhid, which are Tawhid ar-Ruboobiyyah, Tawhid al-Ibaadah and Tawhid al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, and he has through this explanation, silenced the later ones who waged a war against such a presentation of the Tawhid of the Messengers. So it's worthy we comment on it piecemeal.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Baqillani's Corroboration of the Tawhid of the Messengers</font>    <P>
He said:     <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1610;&#1605;&#1575;&#1606; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1610;&#1578;&#1590;&#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1608;&#1581;&#1610;&#1583; &#1604;&#1607; &#1587;&#1576;&#1581;&#1575;&#1606;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1589;&#1601; &#1604;&#1607; &#1576;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1606;&#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1589; &#1593;&#1606;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1581;&#1583;&#1608;&#1579; &#1605;&#1606; &#1580;&#1575;&#1586;&#1578; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607;.</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And faith (al-eemaan) in Allaah, the Exalted comprises <b>making Tawhid for Him</b>, the Sublime (i.e. singling Him out), and describing Him with His Attributes, and negating shortcomings from Him which [otherwise] indicate the "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" (createdness) of the one upon whom these shortcomings are permissible.</blockquote>    <P>
In light of the sum of the two statements above, what al-Baqillani means by "<b>making Tawhid for Him</b>", is <b>a)</b> singling Him out <u>in worship</u>, and <b>b)</b> singling Him out <u>in His attributes</u> and <b>c)</b> negating such descriptions from Him that would necessitate "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>". And this third part here is simply <u>the Kullaabi doctrine</u> of negating attributes for Allaah which are tied to His will and power (i.e. His actions) - and this is what the Ash'aris consider to be from Tawhid, meaning to negate that He makes <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (as an action) and <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (as an action) and that He displays love, anger, pleasure (as actions) - this is what al-Baqillani means, because upon the Kullaabi doctrine, affirming these attributes are incompatible with the intellectual proof used to prove Allaah's existence ("<i><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></i>") - remember they were upon that same intellectual proof pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (<a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a>) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (<a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a>) - so they deny what they refer to as "<i>hawaadith</i>" (events, occurrences) and this was unknown to the Salaf and their Imaams, for they affirmed <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, Attributes and Actions, and their books are replete and full of that in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
So this is what he means when he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and negating shortcomings from Him which [otherwise] indicate the createdness of the one upon whom these shortcomings are permissible.</blockquote>    <P>
He then explains what he means by "Tawhid":    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1608;&#1581;&#1610;&#1583; &#1604;&#1607; &#1607;&#1608;: &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1602;&#1585;&#1575;&#1585; &#1576;&#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1579;&#1575;&#1576;&#1578; &#1605;&#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1583;&#1548; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1601;&#1585;&#1583; &#1605;&#1593;&#1576;&#1608;&#1583;&#1548; &#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1603;&#1605;&#1579;&#1604;&#1607; &#1588;&#1610;&#1569;&#1563; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1575; &#1602;&#1585;&#1585; &#1576;&#1607; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609;: "&#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1607;&#1603;&#1605; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1604;&#1575; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1610;&#1605;" &#1608;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1607;: "&#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1603;&#1605;&#1579;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1605;&#1610;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1589;&#1610;&#1585;"  </div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And "<b>making Tawhid for Him</b>" is: Affirming that He is established, existing, and one ilaah (deity), single, worshipped (ma'bood), there being no likeness unto Him, upon what is established by His saying, the Exalted, "<b>And your ilaah (deity) is a single (deity), there is none which has the right to be worshipped except He, the One full of mercy, Merciful (to His servants)</b>" (Baqarah 2:163), and His saying, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b>" (ash-Shura 42:11).</blockquote>    <P>
So here he has essentially affirmed Tawhid ar-Ruboobiyyah (affirmation of His Existence) and Tawhid al-Ibaadah, (a single deity, worshipped), and there being no likeness unto Him, this being Tawhid al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, along with what he already stated earlier that from Tawhid is to describe Him with His attributes.    <P>
Then in the second statement, it is more clear, and we see it very explicitly here:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1610;&#1580;&#1576; &#1571;&#1606; &#1610;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;: &#1571;&#1606; &#1589;&#1575;&#1606;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1605; &#1580;&#1604;&#1578; &#1602;&#1583;&#1585;&#1578;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;&#1563;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Issue: And it is obligatory to know that the creator of the universe, lofty is His power, is one (waahid) unique (ahad) ... </blockquote>    <P>
So after affirming the creator of the universe (Tawhid ar-Ruboobiyyah) being one, unique, he goes on to explain precisely what he means:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'> &#1608;&#1605;&#1593;&#1606;&#1609; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603;: &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1605;&#1593;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1587;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1581;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1573;&#1610;&#1575;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the meaning of that is: That there is not with Him an ilaah besides Him, <b>and nor anyone who has the right of worship, except Him alone</b>...</blockquote>    <P>
So here you should pay attention to his saying, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'> &#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1605;&#1593;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1587;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607;</span>), and his saying, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1581;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1573;&#1610;&#1575;&#1607;</span>), so this is Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and it constitutes a silencing of those who claim that "Tawhid al-Ibaadah" is an innovation of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> or Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab.    <P>
Then he goes on to explain what he does not mean:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1606;&#1585;&#1610;&#1583; &#1576;&#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1575;&#1606;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1605;&#1606; &#1580;&#1607;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1583;&#1583;&#1548; &#1608;&#1603;&#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;&#1548; &#1608;&#1601;&#1585;&#1583; &#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1583; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603;</div>    <P>

So this only confirms and emphasizes that he actually means singling out Allaah in His right to be worshipped, because he has clarified here that by using the words "waahid" (one), and "ahad" (unique) and "fard" (singular) that he <u>does not mean</u> singularity, or uniqueness <u>in number</u>. Then he states one more what he does mean:    <P>

So here speaks with what amounts to Tawhid al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, and Tawhid al-Uloohiyyah, and he explains this to be the meaning embodied in the saying of Allaah, and the actual kalimah itself    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1602;&#1583; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609;: "&#1573;&#1606;&#1605;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;" &#1608;&#1605;&#1593;&#1606;&#1575;&#1607;: &#1604;&#1575; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and Allaah, the Exalted said, "<b>Indeed Allaah is a single ilaah (deity)</b>" (an-Nisa 4/171), and its meaning is "<i>There is none which has the right to be worshipped except Allaah (alone)</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
So there you have it, al-Baqillani, has spoken with the classic understanding of Tawhid which consists of Tawhid ar-Ruboobiyyah, Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and Tawhid al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, and even though he has not expressly used these terms, in his explanation, the whole of Tawhid is comprised in the meanings that these three terms represent, which al-Baqillani has used to express what faith in Allaah means and requires.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Meaning of the Kalimah</font>    <P>
It is worthy to single out attention to the statements of al-Baqillani, in explanation of Tawhid:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1605;&#1593;&#1607; &#1573;&#1604;&#1607; &#1587;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1581;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1573;&#1610;&#1575;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...there is not with Him an ilaah besides Him, and nor anyone who has the right of worship, except Him alone</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1605;&#1593;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1581;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1607;&#1610;&#1577; &#1587;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... there is none alongside Him that deserves [the right] of ilaahiyyah besides Him.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is how the kalimah has been explained by the Ulamaa' of Tawheed, and this is the Tawhid of the Messengers, and this is unlike the classification given by those <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who came later such as ash-Shahrastani and others who explain Tawhid as:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'> &#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1601;&#1610; &#1584;&#1575;&#1578;&#1607; &#1604;&#1575; &#1602;&#1587;&#1610;&#1605; &#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1601;&#1610; &#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1586;&#1604;&#1610;&#1577; &#1604;&#1575; &#1606;&#1592;&#1610;&#1585; &#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1608;&#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1601;&#1610; &#1571;&#1601;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1607; &#1604;&#1575; &#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1603; &#1604;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah, the Exalted is one (waahid) in His Essence, He has no divisibility (therein), and one (waahid) in his eternal Attributes, there is no equal to Him therein, and one (waahid) in His actions, there is not partner to Him therein.</blockquote>    <P>
And this explanation does not go beyond Tawhid ar-Ruboobiyyah and the affirmation that He has attributes. And this is what the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> remained upon till this day of ours. With the infusion of Gnostic Sufism into the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab a few centuries after al-Baqillani (d. 403H), coupled with this deficient understanding of Tawhid, the way was paved for directing worship to others besides Allaah.    <P>
As for those who presented the classification of Tawheed upon affirmation of ar-Ruboobiyyah, al-Uloohiyyah and al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, then they include <u>Ibn Hibbaan al-Bustee</u> (d. 354H), <u>Ibn Battah al-Ukbaree</u> (d. 387H), <u>Ibn Mandah</u> (d. 395H) and <u>Ibn Waleed at-Turtooshi</u> (d. 520H), and they all precede Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab by centuries. <P>
