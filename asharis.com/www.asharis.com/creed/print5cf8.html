<div class='sidebar'>This is the fourth part of a series. Please be sure to read <a href=index2670.html?kagzi>Part 1</a>, <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>Part 2</a> and <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>Part 3</a>, each of them have an introduction containing background information which is essential reading. There are five parts in total, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>Part 4</a>, <a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>Part 5</a>. </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Paper Background: Predication, Immutability, the Ten Categories</font>    <P>
We already covered this in the <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>Part 2</a>, but since it is crucial to understanding the matter, we are reproducing it here. The author discussed the issue of predication and immutability. <i><b>Predication</b></i> is simply to assign a quality, attribute or property to a thing. And <i><b>immutability</b></i> means the inability to change, to not undergo any type of change. Now <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> spoke a lot about the issue of predication, and this was a linguistic discussion, however, this was integrally tied to his syllogistic logic, by which the truthfulness of propositions is evaluated. A proposition is simply to say "A is B", such as "the tea is hot." You have probably heard of this before, its like this:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>All A's are B's<BR>  X is an A<BR>  Therefore X is a B</blockquote></div>    <P>
So since the truth and falsehood of propositions was integral to attaining knowledge to <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the issue of predication in the language, as in assigning qualities and  properties to things, was discussed in detail by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. Likewise, he also laid down what are known as his Categories, which is known as <b>al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b> (substance and incidental attribute) or <b>al-Maqulat al-Ashar</b> (the ten categories). The intent of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> here was to <u>comprehensively categorize</u> everything that can take the place of a subject and a predicate in a proposition. In the proposition "<i>the tea is hot</i>", the "<i>tea</i>" is the subject and "<i>is hot</i>" is the predicate. So he came up with ten categories and everything in the universe is either a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (jawhar, jism) or nine incidental attributes, and incidental attributes are found only in substances. All of this <u>created the framework</u> upon which his logic and philosophy could be built. These ten categories are presented below:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The first category deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (a'raad, also referred to as "accidents") which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol></div>    <P>
Once this is clear, what we need to understand is that these aspects of Aristotle's philosophy already affected those amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians before it affected the Muslims. And so what we are going to do here is look at the theology of a Jew and a Christian before Islam came (we will look at the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in a separate article altogether). One is <b><a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a></b> (20BC-50CE) was a Jew from Alexandria who was present around the time <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (alayhis salaam), and the second is <b><a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a></b> of Hippo (d. 430CE), a Christian. Now, you will see a stark resemblance between the language of their theology and the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, in fact its identical. the ilm al-kalaam, of the Ahl al-Kalaam is not so original. Rather, it's simply the second-hand, used and abused toy of the past nations (Sabeans, Jews, Christians). Unfortunately, when it came into the hands of the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), they took it and lapped it up like a kid does a ice-cream, not realizing that there has been many a nation, or scholastic whose already "<i>been there, done that</i>." So pay attention, we will be discussing predication, immutability and negating Aristotle's ten categories from Allaah - which is essentially what the deen of the Mutakallimin is founded upon - as opposed to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, which is:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>To affirm for Allah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him without <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (which include tafwid), takyif, tamthil, tahrif (which includes ta'wil) and tashbih, and there is not any tashbih in anything that the revealed texts affirmed for Him by consensus of the Imaams of the Salaf.</b></div>    <P>
We can now continue where we left off in the <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>previous article</a> discussing the use of the conceptual tools of predication and the ten categories (al-maqulat al-ashar, al-jawhar wal-'arad) of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> by <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria (d. 50CE) and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo (d. 430CE). In the <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>previous article</a> we saw what is more or less an identical treatment of theism between <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a>, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, and the Mutakallimin from Islam, with identical language. We also pointed out that the route and reason through which these factions (a Jewish Scholar, a Christian Scholar and the Mutakallimin) came to use these conceptual tools were different, even if in the end result, their theological language was the same. For the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, they inherited the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (the origination of bodies) through the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who took it from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. And this was entered in to the Ummah by al-Ja'd bin Dirham who took it from the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of Harraan, and likewise he took the saying of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created from the Jews (whose theology was already affected by the conceptual tools of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and who were already saying that the Torah is created).    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, the Jewish Mutakallim, Using Aristotle's Conceptual Tools To Negate Hawaadith (Events) From Allaah</font>    <P>
The author of the paper said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-h.gif border=0>    <P>
The issues of Allaah's chosen actions (<i>sifaat fi'liyyah, af'aal ikhtiyaariyyah</i>), that Allaah is doer of whatever He wills, is the <u>underlying issue</u> being discussed here, and <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> preceded the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> by about 900 years and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by about 750 years in this matter, using the same language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad.    <P>
There are a number of issues to think about here, all of which are raised by the above paragraph, from them:    <P>
<blockquote>How the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> tried to treat the problem of Allaah's actions so as to avoid "events" (hawaadith) in Allaah's essence. So they said that the fi'l (action) is the maf'ul (the result of the act) and there is not in any reality a fi'l (act) established with the faa'il (doer).     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> The actions of Allaah are not like our actions, and we are establishing that <u>there are three separate matters</u>, the faa'il, the fi'l and the maf'ul - and Imaam <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> refuted this Mu'tazilee, Kullaabee (and Ash'ari) principle when he brought evidences from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to show that Allaah distinguished between Himself, his act of creating and the actual creation itself (in his book <i>Khalq Af'aal al-Ibaad</i>). So Ahl al-Sunnah affirm "actions" for Allaah and that they are established with His essence, without that meaning that when Allaah performs actions, they must be like ours. </div>    <P>
But this is how the Mutakallimin tried to deal with Allaah's attributes (the Mu'tazilah) and actions (Kullaabiyyah Ash'ariyyah). Hence, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> said <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> is an act that takes place in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it is not an act established with Allaah Himself.     <P>
<u>Another approach</u> that was taken was to say that the problematic attributes of action are in fact eternal. Hence, love, pleasure, anger are eternal attributes like life, knowledge, power and so on. And this was to avoid ascribing "events" to Allaah, so these are not tied to Allaah's will and power any more. This was the approach of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>.    <P>
<u>Another approach</u> was to make some of those attributes of action synonymous with an eternal attribute like wish (iraadah). So the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> said <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> and anger are simply Allaah's intent to reward and punish respectively. This was the approach of <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
All of this was to avoid <u>sequential activity</u>, to deny that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, because that would mean that these actions are hawaadith (events) and this would clash with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (arguing that the bodies of the universe are originated because they have events, contingencies). The motive for the Mutakallimin in this was that they did not consider it possible for their proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be falsifiable, they considered it to be the absolute truth, and thus they took these approaches towards the revealed texts and opposed the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Salaf.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>However in the revealed texts, Allaah states that He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> <u>after</u> creating the heavens and earth, and that He created <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>before</u> He created the Preserved Tablet, and that He created the heavens and earth fifty-thousand years <u>after</u> writing down all the decrees, and that He ordered the Angels to prostrate <u>after</u> creating Adam, and that He will arrive and come on the Day of Judgement and that His speech to Moses is other than His speech to Muhammad which are other than His speech on the Day of Judgement to the Believers, or to the inhabitants of Hellfire and so on.     <P>
<blockquote><b>And none of this means He is originated, since whether or not a thing is originated or not <u>is based upon whether it was preceded by non-existence</u>. Not upon whether attributes or actions are established with it. But this was <u>the false premise</u> upon which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> based their proof for the origination of bodies [they took this from the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, <a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>they are covered in the next article</a>] and so they had to remain true to its lawaazim (binding necessities) which the  <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> did (reject everything), and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> did (reject everything but affirm names only on the surface), but the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took the path of contradiction affirming some attributes and denying others, and then inventing <u>ludicrous principles</u> when unable to counter-argue through pure reason, in order to justify that stance such as <i>al-'arad laa yabqaa zamaanayn</i>, the gist of which is that Allaah's attributes are eternal, never perishing, but as for the attributes in all created things, they are constantly perishing and being recreated at every indivisible instant of time. Thus, if we say that the smallest indivisible unit of time is one thousand trillionths of a second, then according to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, the color of your keyboard, the hotness of your tea, and the attributes of everything in the universe have perished one thousand trillion times and have been recreated one thousand trillion times in just one second. And this was to argue against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as to why they (the Ash'arites) affirm attributes for Allaah, when they are nothing but <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) according to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. </blockquote></b></div>    <P>
Returning to the issue, a man is originated <u>not because</u> he is hearing, seeing, speaking (i.e. because he has attributes) or that he has actions which he performs which are different to each other (i.e. because he has actions), but rather, <u>because he was preceded by non-existence</u>. Thus everything that emanates from him or is found in him, of attributes and actions, takes that same ruling. As for Allaah, then He possesses attributes and performs actions, and His actions are not all performed pre-eternally, as some of the Mutakallimin claim (the Maturidiyyah), for this would necessitate upon them to speak with the eternity of the universe or something from it.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is because there are certain actions Allaah has spoken of which cannot have taken place except with the existence of His creation, and we can give two prominent examples, first the saying of Allaah:    <P>

<blockquote>Allaah has indeed heard the saying of those who said, "Indeed Allaah is poor and we are rich"! (Aali Imraan 3:181)</blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote>Indeed Allaah has heard the statement of she (Khawlah bint Tha'labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad) concerning her husband (Aus bin As-Saamit), and complains to Allaah. And Allaah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Seer. (Al-Mujadilah 58:1)</blockquote>    <P>
From these verses Allaah has affirmed, <u>in the past tense</u>, and with the particles "qad" (denoting completion of an act) and "laqad" (denoting completion of an act with emphasis) - that He heard (sami'a) the saying of she who disputes and of the saying of the Jews, and also affirmed <u>in the present tense</u> that He hears (yasma'u) the discussion (of she who disputes).    <P>
Thus if one tries to affirm all the actions Allah has affirmed for Himself as being pre-eternal actions, then they must require the creation, which means the creation had to exist eternally with Him. The entire <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is filled with examples of such a nature, and it is not possible to sustain such a position (that all Allah's actions are a single action in pre-eternity) as it necessitates a broad rejection of much of the speech of Allaah and His Messenger.     <P>
<b>Sidepoint:</b> As for the saying of the Maturidiyyah who claim to affirm actions for Allaah and that "Allaah's actions are not created" then what they mean by this is that all of Allaah's actions are lumped together into one attribute called takwin (formulation, creation) which is eternal. This was just a rational attempt to try and reconcile between the proof of huduth al-ajsaam and the affirmation of actions for Allaah and in holding this view, they simply took the same approach as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> did with the attributes (all are synonymous with the essence) or as the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> did with the actions [like <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, pleasure, anger, love] (all or actions that take place in the creation, or are synonymous with iraadah, or are eternal like life, power, knowledge]. So the Maturidis simply said Allaah does have actions, but they are all a single action called takwin, and it is one eternal attribute of His essence. The aim of all of them was to find ways to remain consistent with this proof of huduth al-ajsaam.</div>    <P>
Hence, <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> was created before the Preserved Tablet.

And all of these are actions established with Allaah's essence, and Imaam <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> refuted the principle of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in his Kitab al-Tawhid in the Sahih by proving from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that there is <i>fi'l</i> (act), <i>faa'il</i> (the doer of the act) and <i>maf'ul</i> (that which results from the act) as a refutation of those who denied Allaah has actions established with His essence. And in reality, it is not possible resolve the whole argument of the eternity or origination of the universe [between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the Mutakallimin - which arose because the Mutakallimin denied Allaah's chosen actions upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam] except by affirming <u>Allaah has actions tied to His will and power</u> and this is what is plain and manifest in the Book, the Sunnah and the irrefutable consensus of the Salaf - unfortunately rejected by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah - all for the sake of what fundamentally originates from the 'aql of a pagan disbeliever, worshipper of the stars and idols who corrupted the deen of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians, let alone the deen of the Mutakallimin.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo, the Christian Jahmee, Mu'tazilee on Tarkib (Composition), the Attributes and the Essence</font>    <P>
Later in the paper we see:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-i.gif border=0>    <P>
In this passage we see the issue of <b>tarkib (composition)</b> used by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to deny Allaah has attributes which are additional to His essence. When the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, particularly <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) saw the flaw in the proof of huduth al-ajsaam and its underlying premises, he incorporated this proof in order to argue against Ahl al-Sunnah on the issue of al-'uluww and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
Also we see in this passage the approach of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in trying to deal with <b>the attributes</b> and <b>multiplicity</b> in Allaah's essence. They had one of two approaches, <u>the first</u> is to claim the attributes are synonymous with Allaah's essence, as in they are Allaah's essence (and that is what Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> is saying above). <u>The second</u> is to say that His attributes are whatever is external to His essence. Thus, His mercy is only the manifestation of mercy in creation, not that He has mercy as an attribute, and likewise with the other attributes. So they used a combination of these two approaches to deny Allaah's attributes as attributes of the essence. We see in the above the Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> is taking first approach that all of Allaah's attributes are His essence.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> borrowed both of these approaches from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in relation to Allaah's chosen actions. Thus, Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is something separate, created, and did not originate with Allaah as speech (qawl). Then they innovated the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> as their way of affirming <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in such a way so as to counter the arguments of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Baatil (Allaah only has the innovated attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee) to defend baatil (Allaah does not speak according to His will and power). Likewise, we see this approach in their saying that Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> is actually an act that takes place in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, not that it is an action of Allaah. And likewise when they made the attributes of pleasure, anger, love to be synonymous with Allaah's wish (iraadah). So the methodology used by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in relation to the attributes, was borrowed by the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> in relation to the actions.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes</font>    <P>
We can now make some closing notes regarding this specific paper which has spanned three parts (see the <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>first</a> and <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>second</a>):    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> The <u>conceptual tools</u> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in particular, such as his theories of predication and his ten categories (<u>al-jawhar wal-'arad, al-ajsaam wal-a'araad, al-maqulat al-ashar</u>) had already affected the theology of nations prior to Islam, such as the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians. We see language and approaches used by the likes of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus (d. 50CE) and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> (d. 430CE) which are identical to the language of the Mutakallimin and their particular methodological approaches. Except that the Mutakallimin never set out to use Aristotle's conceptual tools as may have <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>. Rather, they were forced into thinking and speaking about Allaah in that manner because they adopted the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies) to prove  the universe is originated. This proof was devised by the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a>, as remnants of them still believed in the universe being created.  This came to al-Ja'd bin Dirham with his interactions with them and likewise his interactions with Jews from whom he took the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and that Allah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. As we have indicated, the Jews were already upon that <u>theology of negating <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and hawaadith</u> (in other words, they already had "tajahhum" and "i'tizaal" with them) - that's the reason why they said the Torah is created - and this is what al-Ja'd bin Dirham  brought into the Ummah, and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> took it from him and popularized it.    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> What entered into the ummah is nothing but the used and broken toys (originally made in Greece) that the Jews and Christians had been playing with aforetime, <u>between 500 to 900 years earlier</u> (in the case of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and Augustine), but these Mutakallimin (of this ummah)  thought that these toys were the best thing since the horse-wheel-cart, and thought they could aid the religion with them, not knowing that the Jews and Christians had already preceded them in getting their hands on these toys. And how appropriate is the saying of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam) at this point, "<i>You shall certainly follow the ways of those who came before you.</i>.."    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> came, incorporated the notion of the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>) into it to refine and simplify the proof, and upon all of this they unleased the tribulation of the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created. It was upon the 'aql of a pagan disbeliever, worshipper of stars and idols, and "<a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a>" amongst the Jews (Philo and others, then later, Abaan, Talut, Labeed) [and Christians], that these Mutakallimin unleashed this calamity upon the Ummah until <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> stood in the face of these heretics and subdued them, having to endure the afflictions through four different leaders, over many long years.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> When the people abandoned the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and they lost respect in the hearts of the people and the rulers no longer supported them, along came <u>Ibn Kullaab and his faction</u>. He debated with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, aided something of the truth, but they confused him on the issue of the sifat fi'liyyah, in particular as it relates to the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. So he was forced to agree with something of their usool and had to negate all of Allaah's chosen actions, those tied to His will and power. However, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> did not believe this proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be the ultimate truth, nor that it was obligatory, and this is why he was close in most of his views with Ahl al-Sunnah. <b>The only distinguishing feature was his denial of Allaah's chosen actions</b>. Then when <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, he took the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and although as a Mu'tazili he believed huduth al-ajsaam to be the foundation for the entire religion, in his post-Mu'tazili days he considered it an innovation.  Unfortunately,  when <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H) came, and he is the person who really formalized the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab, he opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and laid down this proof for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, taking it wholesale from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. These were <u>two very unfortunate incidents in history</u>, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> getting confused by the usool of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, after debating them with pure reason, and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> opposing <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in the issue of this proof, which unfortunately, laid down the path for the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> to  be forced to recede into the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (by having to remain consistent with all of its lawaazim, binding necessities), even if <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> himself was closer to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and had much better views on <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. However, whatever Allaah decrees and whatever He wills He does. The above also explains <u>the amazing perspicacity of Imaam Ahmad</u> (rahimahullaah) in his severe rejection against the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, al-Karaabeesee, and al-Muhaasibee. He knew that the door they opened is simply a small crevice, a crack, that would eventually lead, over time, to the people being drawn back into that kufr which is the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, and how insightful he was indeed - see the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Scholars themselves admit this is what they believe (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>here</a>, <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>here</a>, <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>here</a>, <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> and <a href=indexf452.html?bxzbp>here</a>) in agreement with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. It is for this reason <u>he is the greatest of the Imaams of the Sunnah without dispute</u>, and it is for this reason that today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> make veiled attacks upon him through a variety of deceptive approaches which are too long to mention here.    <P>
<b>FIVE:</b> We see how the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> inherited [through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah] the 'aql, the conceptual tools, in their theology, of a pagan disbeliever, worshipper of stars, despite being opponents to his followers like al-Farabi and <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> who were following the beliefs of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> of the eternity of the universe, rejection of resurrection and rejection of prophethood. However, even though they fought these zindeeqs on these subject areas, they actually concurred with them in that the true and real language for describing truthfully what Allaah is and is not, lies in this language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad and not in what Allaah and His Messenger revealed, which was only for the dumb commoners, so as to not to make them flee from faith. This viewpoint is explicit in both <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (see <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a> and <a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>here</a>) and they simply followed <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> in that (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>), having  got diseased by his books <i>al-Shifaa</i> and <i>al-Ishaaraat</i>.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Next in this series, we will address the theology of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a>, and see the same theology based upon negation of attributes, which is the foundation of the speech of al-Ja'd bin Dirham, al-Jahm, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and later the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, and is the foundation of the ilm al-kalaam, which is speech about al-ajsaam and al-a'raad.</div>    <P>
