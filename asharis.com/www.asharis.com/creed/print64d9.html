<p><font class='titleHeadline'>His Lineage, Birth and Death</font>    <P>
He is Abu al-Hasan Alee bin Ismaa'il bin Abi Bishr Ishaaq, and is lineage traces back to the companion Abu Musa <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu). He was born in 260H and it has also been said, 266H and 270H. He died in 330H according to the strongest of opinions.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Various Stages of His Life</font>    <P>
Abu Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> went through a number of stages in his life, some of them are agreed upon by the Scholars and in others there are some differences of opinion.    <P>
<b><u>The Stage of I'tizaal</u></b>    <P>
Al-Asha'ri was brought up in the household of Abu Alee al-Jubaa'ee and ended up becoming an Imaam for the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, aiding and arguing for the correctness of their madhhab.    <P>
Ibn Asaakir in his "Tabyeen" (p.131) quotes from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> in one of his books that he wrote:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We wrote a large work regarding the Attributes which we called 'Kitaab ul-Jawaabaat Fi as-Sifaat 'an Masaa'il Ahl iz-Zaigh wa ash-Shubuhaat', in which we criticized a  (previous) book of ours which we had written a long time ago in which there was a validation of the madhhab of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - there not being a book being authored for them like it! Then Allaah, the Sublime, made the truth clear to us, and so we turned back from that (I'tizaal) and we criticized it and made its misguidance clear.</blockquote>    <P>
The Imaam, Abu Naasir as-Sijzee (d. 444H) wrote in his Risaalah on al-Harf was-Sawt, quoting from one of the Maalikee fuquhaa that:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Ash'aree remained for forty years upon I'tizaal and then he made tawbah, turning back from the furoo' (subsidiary matters) but remaining established upon the usool (foundational matters), meaning the foundational matters of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> upon which they built their negation of the Attributes, such as the evidence of al-a'raad (non-essential, incidental attributes of essences) and others.</blockquote>    <P>
<b><u>The Second Stage</u></b>    <P>
There are a number or explanations from the scholars regarding precisely what happened in the stage after I'tizaal and there are a couple of sayings regarding this:    <P>
<ul><li>That after abandoning I'tizaal <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> only had one more stage which was his following of Abdullah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab, and in this stage he held views that were in between those of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and those of the Salaf.    <P>
<li>That <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> desired to reconcile between the fuquhaa (jurists) and the muhadditheen (scholars of hadeeth) (as one group) and the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (Ahl ul-Kalaam) (as another) - on account of the enmity that existed between them. Meaning, between those who affirmed the Attributes and those who negated the Attributes. So when <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> saw that (the enmity) he brought his own madhhab in which he took a path in between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the People of Hadeeth.</ul>    <P>
This view is the supported by Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> who says that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> remained a Kullaabi (follower of Ibn Kullaab), as well as Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Abi al-Izz (the explainer of at-Tahawi's creed).    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah said in Majmoo' ul-Fataawaa (16/471):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and his likes are a barzakh (intermediate phase) in between the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. They took from them (the Salaf) correct, sound speech and from them (the Jahmiyyah) intellectual principles they thought to be correct whereas (in reality) they were corrupt. And amongst the people were those who inclined towards him from the Salafi angle, and amongst the people are those who inclined towards  him from the innovatory <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> angle, such as Abu Mu'aali [al-Juwaynee] and his followers.</blockquote>    <P>
And he also said in Dar' ut-Ta'aarud (2/16):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the issue of al-af'aal al-ikhtiyaariyyah (those actions that are tied to will, choice) being performed by Him, then <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and others negated them, and they built their saying on the issue of the Qur'aan upon this. As a result of this, and other [affairs], the people spoke about them on this subject with what is well-known in the books of the people of knowledge, and they ascribed innovation and the remnants of aspects of I'tizaal to them.</blockquote>    <P>
And he also said in Majmoo' ul-Fataawaa (8/424):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And that for which the Imaams of the Sunnah used to (show) rejection against <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> was the remnants of Tajahhum (the madhhab of Jahm Ibn Safwaan) and al-I'tizaal, such as the belief in the correctness of the (the use of the philosophical ideas of) incidental attributes and (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), composition of bodies (tarkeeb ul-ajsaam), and rejecting that Allaah can be described with attributes that He wills and chooses, and whatever is similar to that from those matters that became difficult upon those who were more knowledgeable of the Sunnah, Hadeeth and sayings of the Salaf and the Imaams than <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, such as al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee and Abu Alee ath-Thaqafee, and Abu Bakr bin Ishaaq as-Subghee.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Scholars Who Spoke of al-Ash'ari's Return To the Truth</font>    <P>
Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> said in Siyar (15/86):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I have seen four works authored on the usool (foundations of the religion) of Abul-Hasan in which mentions the principles of the madhhab of the Salaf with regard to the Attributes ,and he said therein: "They are to be passed on as they have come", then he said, "And this is what I speak with, and which I hold as my religion, and they are not to be interpreted (with ta'weel)".</blockquote>    <P>
And he also said in Tadhkirat ul-Huffaad (2/709), when he gave the biography of Zakariyyaa as-Saajee:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from him (as-Saajee) did Abul Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> al-Usooli take the formulation of the statement of the Ahl ul-Hadeeth and [that of] the Salaf.</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> also speaks of the influence of as-Saajee upon <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, saying in Majmoo ul-Fataawaa (5/386):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Zakariyyaa bin Yahyaa as-Saajee, Abul Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took from him whatever he took from him of the foundations of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Hadeeth, and much of what he quotes in the book "Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen" is from the madhhab of Ahl ul-Hadeeth</blockquote>    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah says in Majmoo ul-Fataawaa (3/288):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And he took the usool of hadeeth from Zakariyyaa as-Saajee in Basrah, and when he went to Baghdaad he took other affairs from the Hanablees of Baghdaad, and that was his final affair as he and his companions have mentioned in their books.</blockquote>    <P>
And there are a number of others who have spoken in this regard, including Ibn Katheer, Nu'maan al-Aloosi, Muhibb ud-Deen al-Khateeb. And from the clearest of evidences of what has been said above is al-Ash'aris final book "<a href=reports/the-aqeedah-of-abu-hasan-al-asharee-in-the-latter-part-of-his-life.html>al-Ibaanah</a>".    <P>
And Ibn Asaakir, who is an Ash'ari, went to some exaggeration to state that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> were in complete agreement. Whilst Ash'ari did adopt the madhhab of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> at the end of his life, because his knowledge of the madhhab of the Salaf was only in general detail at that point in time, he was not in complete agreement with all the specifics of the madhhab of the Salaf, and thus, there still remained, even in his final stage, signs of the influence of his past.    <P>
Ibn Asaakir says in "Tabyeen Kadhib al-Muftaree" (p. 163):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So reflect, may Allaah have mercy upon you, this belief that he clarified and explained, and acknowledge the excellence of this Scholar, Imaam who explained and clarified it ... And make clear the excellence of Abul-Hasan and acknowledge his justice and listen to his description of Ahmad with excellence and his acknowledgement (in that regard) so that you may know that they were in agreement in creed, and undivided in the foundations (usool) of the religion, and the madhhab of the Sunnah.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Essence of What Happened with <a href="tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></font>    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah said in Majmoo' ul-Fataawaa (12/199), giving an account of what happened with al-Ash'ari:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...rather, he aided many issues well-known to Ahl us-Sunnah, and in which they were opposed by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, such as the issue of ar-Ru'yah (seeing Allaah in the Hereafter), and [Allaah's] Speech, and affirmation of the Attributes and other such things. However, his insight into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (theological philosophy) was detailed whilst his insight into the Sunnah was general, and for this reason he agreed with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in some of their foundations (usool) on account of which they remained (adhering to what was) in opposition to the Sunnah. And he believed that it was possible for him to unite between those foundations and between aiding the Sunnah, as he did in the issue of ar-Ru'yah, the Speech (of Allaah), and the Attributes mentioned in the narrations and other such things. And those who opposed him from Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Hadeeth and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> said:  He is contradictory, those [affairs] in which he agreed with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, contradict those  [affairs] in which he agreed with Ahl us-Sunnah ...</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
Abu Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> was leader in I'tizaal, and spent forty years upon this. After this he took an intermediate path between I'tizaal and the way of the Salaf but eventually tending in most affairs, to the usool of the madhhab of the Salaf. And he has written works which testify to this.    <P>
The contemporary followers of Ash'ari are not true followers of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, but in fact followers of the second stage of his life in which he adopted the views of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. They also follow the influences of the Jahmee and Mu'tazilee school of thought that remained with <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, and which were then given further support by the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> such as Abu Mu'aali <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> with their heavy involvement with <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (theological philosophy). As such today's Ash'aris are better characterised as Kullaabites, or <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> - as they <b>DO NOT</b> follow what <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> died upon.    <P>
<b>Refer to the book:</b> "at-Tamyeez Fee Bayaan anna Madhhab ul-Ashaa'irah Laysa Alaa Madhhab us-Salaf al-Azeez" of Abu Umar Haaee bin Saalim al-Haaee from which the above was summarized with some adaptation.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Stance of the Ash'aris in Relation to the Above</font>    <P>
Today's Ash'aris take two approaches in attempting to flee from the implications of the above: a) To claim that <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> wrote his last books out taqiyyah (deception) out of fear for his life! And b) To claim that the Hanbalees fabricated things in his books to give the appearance that he was upon their madhhab.    <P>
And they go to great lengths - <u>bending over backwards and ending up on all fours</u> - to try to establish the latter claim. But they are not able, and will never be able, to reject Abu Hasan al-Asha'ris repudiation of his Mu'tazilee and Kullaabi past and his abandonment of the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. All of this is clearly manifest in his books and as documented historically by the Scholars and Historians.    <P>
