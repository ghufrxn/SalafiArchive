<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Darbas al-Shaafi'ee, a Qadi of the Ayyubi Dynasty Renders These Contemporary Pusillanimous Academic Fraudsters as "<a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a>"!</font>    <P>
We explained in a <a href=index2046.html?cmwje >previous article</a> that historically, <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> have not been a uniform, monolithic sect, and that when the word "Ashari" is used it can refer to a number of different categories. It is extremely important to grasp this fact, because it lifts the veil from much of the frauds perpetrated by the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> against historical fact, and it clears a lot of the confusion that is found in discussions. Here are the different types of Ash'aris:    <P>
<ul><li> The very early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> (al-Ashari, <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a>, al-Baqillani)   <li> Those who held fast to what is in al-Ibaanah, did not oppose it, and labelled themselves as "Ashari"  <li> Those who were clearly influenced by al-Ibaanah (<a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>)  <li> Those who retreated to the way of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (al-Baghdadi, al-Juwaynee) including those mentioned next:  <li> Those who mixed kalam with zandaqah (philosophy) and tasawwuf, such as <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (that's why western orientalists love them so much, it aids in the destruction of Islam), <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>   <li> Those who are alleged to be <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> upon flimsy pretexts and they are free of it such as Abu Uthman al-Sabuni and,   <li> Those in the later times who were brought up in an era in there was nothing but the Ashari creed, and they grew up influenced by it in some areas, even if they did not speak with its foundations (usul) and they are the likes of Ibn Hajar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>. Even amongst these, some can be said to be <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (<a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>) and others were merely influenced by their way (Ibn Hajar).</ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> <a href='tags/ibn-darbas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Darbas</font></a> al-Shafi'i (d. 659H) [studied with al-Qasim  bin Asakir, the son] who wrote a book called <i>al-Dhabb an Abi al-Hasan al-Ashari</i>, in which he refuted a bunch of <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in his time, who are equivalent to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of our time, who ascribed to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a> but denied he wrote the book or claimed he wrote it whilst being a "Hashawi" - this is upon the view that after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> he became a Hashawi, wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, and then later he wrote al-Luma' and reverted to the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> - some <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> give this particular version of history, which is incorrect in any case, since al-Luma' was written after he left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as indicated by <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> in <a href='tags/tabyin-kadhib-al-muftari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari</font></a>.</div>    <P>
So the point here is that these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of our times are not original and they are not bringing anything new. Their ancestory is well-documented in history, and it was the <b>Ibanah-Asharites</b> (<a href=index2046.html?cmwje>see this article here</a>) who exposed them and refuted them.    <P>
Before continuing with the quotation from <a href='tags/ibn-darbas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Darbas</font></a>, it should be pointed out that it is likely that Salah al-Din al-Ayubi was an <b>Ibanah-Ashari</b> [he studied with <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> (d. 571H)] except that there will have been influences from other Asharite orientations, since "Ashariyyah" has never been a uniform madhhab, and for this reason, this "Ashariyyah" will not have been free from kalam influences. In any case, they will not have denied the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> based on what is found in Ibn Asakir's citation from <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> in <a href='tags/tabyin-kadhib-al-muftari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari</font></a>, and this was the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (and al-Bayhaqi). This renders spurious the claim of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih made by the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as Ash'aris which was rebutted by al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>see that rebuttal here</a>) in his book al-Tamheed.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Darbas al-Shafi'ee (d. 659H) Exposes Todays <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Almost 800 Years Ago</font>    <P>
The author, Ibn Darb&#257;s, said:     <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-darbas-jahmites.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And amongst them is Ab&#363; Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#703;Al&#299; al-Baghd&#257;d&#299;, the resident of Makkah, may All&#257;h guard it. I saw a manuscript of the book al-Ib&#257;nah with his writing from its beginning to its end. And at the end of it was what has just been mentioned. It was in the possession of our Shaykh, the Im&#257;m, the head of the Scholars, the Faq&#299;h, the &#7716;&#257;fidh, the &#703;All&#257;mah Ab&#363; al-&#7716;asan bin Mufa&#7693;&#7693;al al-Maqdis&#299;. I prepared my own manuscript from it and compared it after I had made another copy from what I found in the book of the Im&#257;m Na&#7779;r al-Maqdis&#299; at the Bayt al-Maqdis, may All&#257;h protect it. And one of our companions presented it - in the precincts of Bayt al-Maqdis - to one of those with high ranking <b>among the Jahmiyyah</b> who affiliate themselves, spuriously, to Ab&#363; Hasan al-Ash&#703;ar&#299;. He rejected it and argued against it saying, "We have never heard of it, and nor is it one of his works." And another one strove to work his monotony in trying to put an end to the doubt through his shrewdness, so he said, after moving his beard somewhat, "Perhaps he wrote it when he was a &#7716;ashaw&#299;." So I do not know which of his two affairs are more strange. Whether it is his ignorance of the book despite its fame and the abundance of those who mention it in the authored works from amongst the Scholars, or whether it is his ignorance of the condition of his shaykh against whom he fabricates a lie by ascribing himself to him, [and his ignorance] of [what is] well-known in the ummah - to both its scholar and ignoramus alike - regarding [al-Ash&#703;ar&#299;] being upon i&#703;tiz&#257;l before his repentance. </blockquote>    <P>
Refer to Ris&#257;lah F&#299; al-Dhabb &#703;an Ab&#299; al-&#7716;asan al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; (pp. 130-131) with tahqiq of al-Faqeehi (1984), p. 131. and it has also been printed by Da'irah al-Ma'arif al-Uthmaniyyah in Hyderabaad al-Dikn in India, (1948), p. 6.    <P>
From the above we note:    <P>
<ul><li> There were found, 800 years ago, those who denied the authorship of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> or claimed it was authored when he was a "Hashawi" - upon their belief that after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> he became a Hashawi, wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, and then left that to take the way of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>.     <P>
<li> These are the people referred to as "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" by <a href='tags/ibn-darbas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Darbas</font></a> and they are the ones he is refuting on this matter. This species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, unfortunately, never became extinct, and we still have their likes today, as dumb as they are, in the persons of the likes of <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, Abu Bilal, <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a> and others peddling the same academic frauds as their predecessors of old.  </ul> <P>
