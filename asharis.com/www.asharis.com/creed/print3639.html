<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In the <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>first part</a> of this series we established <u>two different approaches</u>, that of the Sunnah and aathaar brought by the Messenger (alayhis salaam), and that of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, whose <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <i><b>al-ajsaam wal-jawaahir wal-a'raad</b></i> (bodies, substances and their incidental attributes) was borrowed from the <b>pseudo-Sabean idolators</b> and which previous nations had indulged in and used to formulate their particular version of theism. For this reason, stark resemblance is seen between the language of the <b>Mukatallimin of Islam</b> and the <b>Hellenized Jews</b> (an example of which is <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>), the <b>Hellenized Christians</b> (an example of which is <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo - see <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>) and the <b>pseudo-Sabeans</b> (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>) in describing their Lord, which is mostly founded upon a series of negations (negative theology) to avoid describing Allaah with all or some of what His creation is described with. This is not what the Prophets, Messengers or revealed Books were sent with. However, on account of this departure from the Prophets, Messengers and revealed books, it became a hallmark of the kalaamists to accuse the people of Hadith, Sunnah and Aathaar of being <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Recap of Framework</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Further, we separated out twelve factions spanning across these two approaches, and they are:    <P>
<ul><li> The people of Sunnah, hadeeth and aathaar, who are <b>the Salaf</b> and their Imaams.    <P>
<li> Those <b>exaggerating in ithbaat</b> by tashbih which is saying "life like my life, hearing, like my hearing, knowledge like my knowledge, seeing like my seeing, face like my face" and so on. This is ascribed to Muqaatil bin Sulayman (d. 150H)    <P>
<li> Those exaggerating in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> by <b>affirming fabricated narrations</b>, leading to ascribing things to Allaah what He is free of. This is manifested in <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> (d. 453H)    <P>
<li> Those attached primarily to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, hadeeth and their sciences, but who agreed with the conclusions of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> and <b>merged the conclusions of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with the revealed texts</b> (and hence spoke with something of <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid), but they never delved into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> itself as a foundation.  These are <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> (d. 453H), <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar.</ul>    <P>
Then those who were operating upon <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> as a foundation, which became the spring and fountain of their theism:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The Jahmiyyah</b>, who innovated <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> into the Ummah by operating upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (arguing for the origination of bodies through the presence of attributes in them) which they took from the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>,  and then began denying Allah's names, attributes and actions to remain consistent and innovated tahrif (labelled as ta'wil) of the revealed texts to take them away from their meanings, so as not to clash with the proof.    <P>
<li> <b>The Mu'tazilah</b> who inherited this approach from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and who refined this proof of huduth al-ajsaam.    <P>
<li> <b>The Raafidee Mutakallimah Mujassimah</b> who also operated upon <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and the same proof of huduth al-ajsaam and believed in a Lord as a human body with flesh and limbs.     <P>
<li> <b>The Kullaabiyya</b>h who argued with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and fell prey to their doubts on Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>) upon the premise that is fundamental to the proof "<i>whatever is not devoid of hawaadith (events) is itself <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated)</i>" and as a result denied a portion of what Allaah is described with and took certain approaches towards it, similar to what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took towards the attributes. But they affirmed the sifat dhatiyyah khabariyyah (those attributes Allaah's essence is described with through revealed texts).    <P>
<li> <b>The Karraamiyyah</b> who called to <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>, being led to that conclusion by the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and claimed Allaah can acquire attributes he never had before.    <P>
<li> <b>Abu al-Hasan Al-Ash'ari</b>, who is a group on his own for reasons that were explained.    <P>
<li> <b><a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a></b>, who is a group on his own for reasons that were explained.    <P>
<li> <b>The Later Ash'aris</b> who began to recede into the ways of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (besides merging <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with falsafah).  </ul> </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Four Groups to Pay Attention To</font>    <P>
Particular note should be given to the two non-kalaam groups who exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (represented in <u>Muqaatil bin Sulaymaan</u> to whom tashbih is ascribed and <u><a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a></u>) and the two from the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups (<u>the Raafidee Mujassimah</u>, and <u>the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>). It is important to separate all of these and understand the reality of their sayings, views, opinions and the nature of their error. This will allow you to appreciate <b>the great pseudo-Ash'ari swindle</b> of accusing the people of Sunnah, hadeeth and aathaar of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>.    <P>
In this article, <b>Part 2</b> of the series, we commence an outline of the factions that concern us, who are <b>a)</b> <u>Ahl al-Sunnah</u> and the <u>early Kullaabi Ash'aris</u>, <b>b)</b> the <u>Rafidi Mujassimah</u> and <b>c)</b> the <u>Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>. This will be provide more detailed background, in addition to the framework in <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>Part 1</a>, to help us deconstruct the pseudo-Ash'ari swindle.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ahl al-Sunnah and Followers, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and Followers, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and Early Followers</font>    <P>
We are looking at a cross section here, because there are both the people of the pure Sunnah, hadeeth and aathaar and those of the condemned 'ilm al-kalaam in this group, and they are agreed upon the affirmation of certain affairs, which are the 'uluww of Allaah Himself over His creation (in addition to 'uluww of rank and status and power and domination) and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah (face, hands, eyes, love, pleasure, anger and so on). However, those <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> which are tied to Allaah's will and power (like love, pleasure, anger) were not totally denied, only the aspect of will (mashee'ah) in relation to them were denied, and they were made eternal attributes like life, knowledge, power. This was the approach of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, whilst the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took the approach of denying them altogether and interpreting them with something else.    <P>
We have in fact documented statements in affirmation of <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah in other articles as it relates to the early Kullaabis and As'haris, so we can simply make certain points or link to relevant articles on this site.    <P>
<blockquote><b>First Point:</b> Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, their way is plain and manifest, it is not possible for any pseudo-Ash'ari swindler who misguides the common "aspiring to be Ash'ari" <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, to deny that their way was <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of everything that has come in the revealed texts with denial of takyif and tamthil and tashbih and tahreef and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>. There statements are abundant in this regard, and very clear and apparent. They affirmed all His names, attributes, and actions. The battle between them and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> was one of <u>meanings</u> not a battle over texts devoid of meanings. So whoever said the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were accusing Ahl al-Sunnah of being "Mushabbihah, Mujassimah" on the basis of pure letters making up words devoid of meanings is in error, a serious error. Rather, when the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> saw Ahl al-Sunnah affirming names implying meanings, attributes implying meanings and actions implying meanings, they accused them of being <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. This is because they themselves were operating upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to demonstrate the universes is originated, which argues that <u>the presence of meanings</u> in bodies (i.e. their attributes and actions such as color, taste, smell, motion, rest, combination, division, height, width, depth and so on to all the genuses of attributes found in the creation), shows that they are originated. Then to remain consistent they had to reject that the texts in the Book and the Sunnah relating to Allah's attributes indicate meanings which to them were <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (that is, attributes) and hawaadith (that is, actions). Hence, their allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih against Ahl al-Sunnah and their innovation of tahreef (called ta'wil) of the texts which Ahl al-Sunnah rejected from them. This is why we see statements from them stating, "<i>Pass them on as they have  come</i>", "<i>without tafsir</i>", "<i>without sifah</i>", "<i>without ma'naa</i>", all of this was a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and their innovated sayings aimed at changing the original meanings that the texts came with. All of this is historical fact and cannot be denied. The psuedo-Ash'ari swindlers at the higher level who misguide the average Muslim who simply wants to follow the truth know this very well. History is not on their side. This is why they absolutely hate the second and third centuries of Islaam, and they will not go anywhere near it.    <P>
<b>Second Point:</b> That <b><a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a></b> (d. 240), <b>al-Muhaasibi</b> (d. 243H), <b>al-Karaabeesee</b> (d. ~245H), <b>al-Qalaanisee</b> (who are the true and real forerunners and founders of what became known as the true early "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>") all affirmed the attributes of hand, face, and eye(s) as attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) of the essence (dhaat) of Allaah. Likewise <b><a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></b> (d. 324H) himself (see <a href=index0a89.html?cljbd>this article</a> and <a href=indexb9e5.html?xyodn>this one</a>), and <b><a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a></b> (d. 380H), and <b>al-Baqillaani</b> (d. 403H) (see <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>this article</a> and <a href=indexdac3.html?tlyai>this article</a>), and <b><a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a></b> (d. 458H) (<a href=indexbd8e.html?ezymy>see here</a> and <a href=indexc1db.html?djmma>also here</a>) and this is corroborated by the likes of <u>Abu Mansur al-Baghdaadi</u> (d. 429H), <u><a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a></u> (d. 478H), and <u><a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u> (d. 631H) (<a href=index4be3.html?ljaow >see here</a>). Even <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H) affirmed these attributes as attributes of the essence (he stated that it is not possible to deny these as attributes of the essence in the way they have been reported, even if he permitted <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> in general) and likewise <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> (d. 548H) alludes to the same affirmation in his book <i>Niyaayat al-Aqdaam</i>. These affirmations from those early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> were alongside their refutations of the allegations of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih coming from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and you would do well to ponder over this saying of <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>full quote is here</a>), and pay careful attention to the reasoning:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if someone said: What has led you to deny that His Face and Hand is a limb when you do not understand hand as an attribute, and face as an attribute except [in the form of a] limb? It is said to him: <b>That is not necessitated, just like it is not necessitated when we do not understand a living, knowing, able (being) except to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that we, us and you, should judge Allah with the same</b>.    <P>
And just like it is not necessitated when He is established by His own Essence (qaa'iman bi dhaatihi) that He is <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and body just because we, and you, do not find anything established by itself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi) in what we (outwardly) observe except that it is like that (i.e. <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Substance</font></a> and body).    <P>
And the answer to them is likewise if they say: It becomes necessary that His knowledge, life and speech and all of His attributes belonging to His Essence (dhaat) are non-essential incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), genuses, or occurrences (hawaadith), or changes, or coalesce (merge) in Him, or are in requirement of a heart, and they adduced the existence (wujood) [that they observe] as argument [in this regard].</blockquote>    <P>
Now this itself is taken directly from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, who wrote something identical in <i>al-Ibaanah</i>, (see Al-Ib&#257;nah (ta&#7717;q&#299;q, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Ma&#7717;m&#363;d, Egypt, 1977, pp. 136-137):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Issue:</b> And it is said to them: What has led you to reject that All&#257;h, the Exalted meant two hands by His saying, "<b>With my two hands (biyadayya)</b>" (38:75) and not two favours? If they say: Because if <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand) is not [with the meaning of] favour (ni&#703;mah) then it is but a limb (j&#257;ri&#7717;ah).    <P>
It is said to them: Why have you judged that if hand is not favour, then it is but a limb? ... They said: <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), when it is not favour in what is observed, it is but a limb. It is said to them: If you are working [on the basis] of what is observed [in creation] and you judged All&#257;h by way of it, then likewise, we do not find any living thing in the creation except as a body, flesh and blood. So judge All&#257;h with the that [too], exalted is All&#257;h from that.</blockquote>    <P>
We also see <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> rejecting the ta'wils of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (<a href=indexbd8e.html?ezymy> see here</a>), which were unfortunately taken up by other <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and it became the standard doctrine in their ever-evolving school. Their refutations of the deniers were really an extension of what the Salaf were upon against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and is found in the statements of the likes of <b>Nu'aym bin Hammaad</b>, and <b>al-Tirmidhee</b>, and <b>Ishaq bin Raahuyah</b> and others, all of whom said that there is no tashbih in anything that Allaah has described Himself with, which means there is absolutely <u>no tasbhih through mere affirmation of the meanings indicated by the texts</u>. See al-Tirmidhi quote consensus on this matter <a href=indexdf36.html?icwge>in this article</a>. Otherwise these statements of the Salaf are rendered meaningless and their intellect becomes questioned for making such declarations (upon a pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmnite reading of that period in history).     <P>
The aim is to illustrate that this was <u>a battle of meanings</u>, otherwise it makes no sense for the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to accuse Ahl al-Sunnah of being <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and we see this clearly proven in these statements of these early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a>, and we don't even need to quote from any of the Imaams of the righteous Salaf, despite their statements being in the hundreds, if not thousands in regards to this issue. The Salaf and early Kullabis, Ash'aris <u>affirmed meanings</u>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in turn imposed upon those affirmations [of meanings] coming from Ahl al-Sunnah, <u>the takyif of what is found in the creation</u> [treating them to be the <u>haqaa'iq, realities</u>, associated with those meanings affirmed  for Allaah, the Exalted] and upon this, accused them of tashbih and <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>. This observation of historical fact leads to the next point which further corroborates it, [leaving no pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmi <u>falsifier of history</u> any refuge at all]:    <P>
<b>Third Point:</b> Now this is crucial to understand here, which is that the only real difference between the people of the pure Sunnah, hadeeth and aathaar (<u>the righteous Salaf</u>) and a faction from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (<u>Ibn Kullaab, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, al-Baqillani</u>), and those who were attached primarily to hadeeth, were not <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> fundamentally, but accepted the conclusions of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (<u><a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a></u>) is that the Salaf made <b>specific affirmation (<a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>) and general negation (of likeness, resemblance)</b>. Whereas those operating upon <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, or influenced by its conclusions made <b>specific affirmation along with specific negation</b>. To illustrate, these are their sayings:    <P>
<ul><li><u>The Salaf</u>: We affirm life, knowledge, hearing, seeing, face, hands, eye(s) [in their meanings] for Allaah without tamthil, takyif or tashbih [in their realities] [and thereafter remain silent].    <P>
<li> <u><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a></u> (or those influenced by them): We affirm life, knowledge, hearing, seeing, face, hands, eye(s) [in their meanings] but [in their realities] face is not a form, and hands are not limbs and eyes are not pupils.  </ul>    <P>
So general negation is replaced with specific negation involving takyif. Now even if the specific negation may be correct in meaning, <u>from a methodological point of view</u>, it is not the way of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah, and the Salaf to make such specific negations, <b>since takyif in negation is erroneous, as is takyif in affirmation</b>. So this really is a subsidiary issue after they are united in affirming these as attributes for Allaah's essence, without <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and more importantly <u>without tafwid</u>, in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Tafwid was not really innovated as a way and wrongly ascribed to the Salaf until <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> came along and took the way of the  Ash'aris towards the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.     <P>
<b>Fourth Point:</b> From the above, we see <b>the spuriousnenss of the claim that the Salaf were upon tafwid (of the meaning)</b>, since there was no <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> denying the mere existence of letters making up the words found in the texts relating to the attributes. Rather, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were fighting against what is beyond the mere existence of letters making up words, <u>which are meanings</u>, since words indicate meanings. However, when some of the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> like <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u> (d. 478H) saw the falsehood in making <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> because it entails speaking about Allaah without knowledge, and essentially lying upon Allaah, they resorted to tafwid in order to remain consistent with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. Then, decontextualizing, or misinterpreting those statements of the Salaf made in the second and third centuries (i.e. negating <i>tafsir</i>, <i>ma'naa</i>, <i>sifah</i>, <i>kayf</i>) made overwhelmingly against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the one hand and limitedly against the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> on the other, they claimed the Salaf made tafwid. Wrongly, those who came after, the likes of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar, who were not <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, but agreed with their conclusions [since that was the intellectual era into which they were brought up and raised in the circles of knowledge] and <u>merged</u> those conclusions with the Book and the Sunnah which was their real occupation. In this manner, they were led to wrongly believe that tafwid (and ta'wil) was the way of the Salaf. And thus it is from the <u>conniving</u> of the pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmites present today that when they wish to misguide someone away from the way of the Salaf, or to scaremonger them, they will start by throwing statements of the latecomers like <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar and others, and they start by quoting ijmaa's (consensus) [of their kalam views pertaining to the attributes] when this is only a consensus amongst them, the Mutakallimin, as found in their own books (of the Ash'aris and Maturidis), about their own doctrinal school, it is not <u>an actual ijmaa'</u> of the Companions, the Taabi'een and the Righteous Salaf of the first three centuries, because the actual ijmaa' is on one side of the fence and the claimed ijmaa' is on the other. This is again why these people are averse to the first three centuries, their theology can never, ever, ever be corroborated from it. It is also for this reason, that they try to erode people's attachment to the Salaf by attacking ascription to the Salaf. It's a hostile era for them, they don't want people to catch on, and see what their game is really about, and to see that they actually have NO connection to the Salaf and nor to <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and nor to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Why Did <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> Affirm The <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>?</font>    <P>
This brings us to this question now, and the answer is as follows.     <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">All the Mutakallimun based their theology upon the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> - arguing for the origination of bodies through the presence of what they call <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes) and <i>hawaadith</i> (events) in them. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> <u>did not distinguish</u> between <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and hawaadith, they referred to everything as <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (to mean attributes and actions). And they said whatever is not devoid of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> is originated, a body. Hence they negated everything from Allaah, attributes and actions. However <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> <u>distinguished between <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> [what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> use to refer to Allah's attributes and chosen actions] and hawaadith [what the Kullabiyyah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> use to refer to Allaah's chosen actions]</u>, and then they further justified exclusion of Allaah's <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> from the <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) by saying the <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> do not last two instants of time [all attributes in the creation are therefore constantly destroyed and recreated at every smallest instant of time], hence they are only "incidental attributes" in the creation, but as for Allaah, His attributes do not perish, so they are not called <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> but <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>. Thus, whatever are from His permanent attributes (which include face, hands, eyes) are affirmed as such. Further, both <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (in his Kullabi period) <u>never considered the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory</u>, nor the only way to demonstrate Allaah's existence, they acknowledged there were other ways. Because of this, they did not see any clash between this particular proof (amongst proofs) and affirmation of Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (being above the creation) and His attributes such as face,  hands, eye(s) and the likes. Hence, they would refute the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> very strongly on these issues and they would say "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a jism</i>", an "<i>Allaah has a face, hands and eyes, and they are not limbs</i>", and they made these specific negations in countering what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were making binding upon them that they have affirmed a body and limbs for Allaah (by these affirmations). So they saw no problem in these affirmations. However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> believed there was <u>no other proof</u> except huduth al-ajsaam to prove Allaah's existence, hence they said the entirety of belief in Allaah must conform to it, and hence, the revealed texts must be interpreted (i.e. distorted) in order to conform to this proof. This is why they held the views that they did, denying Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, His being seen in the Hereafter with the vision of the eyes, His speaking to Moses, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being His speech and so on, because this would render Him a body. Thus they innovated the <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> (whose instances these very same early Kullabis and Ash'aris refuted strongly).     <P>
Hence, we see the battle between <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but their battle involved the condemned <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> as a result of which they submitted to the validity of something from the false foundations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> underlying their proof of  huduth al-ajsaam, and therefore they denied actions are established with Allaah through His will. And this battle of theirs was after the wider context of the battle of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but that battle was pure Sunnah verses pure <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, in which manifest truth was plain and clear from manifest falsehood.    <P>
However, what happened with the Ash'aris who came after is that they unfortunately treated this proof, like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <u>to be obligatory</u>, and <u>the only way</u> to prove Allaah's existence, and because they adopted this view, opposing <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, they were subsequently forced to recede - over time - into the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, in order to remain consistent with it. Thus, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> we see them denying 'uluww, and denying the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. So they increased in <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and gravitated towards the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. All of their theological writings and polemics are centred around patching up the inconsistencies that were subsequently pointed out to them. So they were forced to choose between discarding the proof and following the way of the Salaf entirely, or to maintain this proof and increase in <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> to remain consistent. They chose the latter and developed their school upon finding ways to patch up this proof, which could only be through increased <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and invention of new views, explanations, rationalities. This is their <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. In choosing this path, they gravitated towards the views of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (having united with them on the view that the whole of Islam depends upon this proof) and therefore their enmity towards these groups waned (as it did towards the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> when they saw no problem in merging kalam with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> to strengthen their theology), and <u>their enmity shifted</u> instead towards the  people of Hadeeth, Sunnah and Aathaar, and this is where we are today and have been for many a century.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion and Summary</font>    <P>
In this article we have established the views of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf and a faction of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, who despite the two different approaches (one true, the other false) were united in certain areas, and the reasons for that have been explained. This means that the diagram of allegiance and loyalty is as follows:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/fence-divide-salaf-later-as.gif border=0>    <P>
The Salaf (including the four Imaams), <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their early followers are on the side where <u>the grass is greener</u>, and the later <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> (and the Maturidis) are on the other side with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <u>animal fodder</u>, and they are all collectively throwing the same accusations against the other side of the fence, being united upon that, sharing in their accusations  and their <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> bullets (hand = qudrah, ni'mah, 'uluww = rank, status, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> = isteelaa and so on). Indeed, we ask Allaah not to make our hearts blind through deliberate rejection of the truth when it stares right in the face [like it is doing right now, after the above]. Ameen.    <P>
This lays another milestone, another slab, or another stake in our progression in deciphering the great pseudo-Ash'ari, neo-Jahmi swindle. Next we will start looking at the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> proper.    <P>
