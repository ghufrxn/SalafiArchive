<p>All praise is due to Allaah and may the prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> have attempted to slander <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> by imputing to him the saying that Allaah is "<a href="tags/composite.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">composite</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/divisible.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">divisible</font></a>", based upon their feeble and crippled intellects mixed with the corrupt intentions and their lack of honesty, integrity and justice towards the opponent. And we have explained in other articles that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explicitly negates that Allaah is "<a href="tags/murakkab.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">murakkab</font></a>" (<a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>) or "munqasim" (<a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>) due to the fact that He is "as-Samad", which signifies His complete oneness, unity and impossibility of being subject to "tarkeeb (composition)" and "inqisaam (divisibility)". And there are abundant texts in this regard from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. Thus, <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> and other such similar things are negated from Allaah, upon their established, known meanings according to the language of the Qur'aan and the language of the Arabs.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Ibn Taymiyyah: Divisibility and Separability Are Impossible For Allaah</b><BR><a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>Click Here To See Part 1</a></div>    <P>
As for the Deniers (of the Attributes) - the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> - then they have their own devised meanings for these terms such as "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and so on.    <P>
<ul><li><u>The Philosophers</u>, who affirm one who is "waajib ul-wujood" (that whose existence is necessary) claim that naming or describing the necessarily existent with any additional meanings is "composition" (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) - thus they accuse all the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) as being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (rendering Allaah to be a body) - because they have declared Him <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>, by implying multiplicity of meanings to Him. This is because the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> affirmed "al-Khaaliq" and "al-Qaadir" for Allaah - they had to when push came to shove - and they negated everything else. And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> affirm the Names, and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> affirm some of the attributes. Therefore, because they all affirm something besides mere existence for Allaah, they are all guilty of declaring Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>, according to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
<li><u>The Jahmites</u> accuse the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of declaring Allaah to be <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> because they have affirmed Names for Allaah.    <P>
<li><u>The Mu'tazilah</u> accuse the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> of having declared Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> because they have affirmed attributes for Him.    <P>
<li><u>The Ash'ariyyah</u> accuse Ahl us-Sunnah of having declared  Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> because they affirm for Allaah whatever has come in the texts of Attributes.  </ul>    <P>
And in all of these accusations, they are working upon meanings for these terms "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" which are not known in the language, rather these meanings and definitions are from their own inventions and fabrications.    <P>
So for example, a man who is described as generous, kind, loving, and patient is said to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> - and he can never be described as "one (waahid)" according to these people. In other words, the mere existence of "distinction" and "otherness" within an entity renders it "not one". This is pure sophistry and falsehood, and Allaah, the Most High, has rendered this futile (as we will see in what follows), in His Book.    <P>
Thus, all of these factions work upon meanings for these terms that are unknown in the language and which actually oppose the language of the Qur'aan and the language of the Arabs. Then upon these devised meanings, they accuse those who affirm the Attributes to have declared Him to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>.    <P>
And it is this same underlying argument that the chief orator of the pro-Jahmite creed from the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H), has used to deny that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and to accuse those who say that He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> of having declared Him <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>. Rather, they say He is al-Ahad and as-Samad and He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without the false necessities fabricated in the mind of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and his likes - who claim that if Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then as <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is mighty, He too must be mighty, and since <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> has a distinct right side and left side, then the same must be the case for Allaah, and this must mean that Allaah has "different areas", and because this is impossible, Allaah cannot be upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and saying that He is means He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a>.    <P>
So these are the fabrications of their own minds, which are false necessities they have made binding upon the sayings of Allaah in His Book, and upon the sayings of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the sayings of the Companions, and the sayings of the Imaams of the Taabi'een, and then those after them, and the generality of the Salaf - which is that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, separate and distinct from His creation, and they declared the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as disbelievers for rejecting this, amongst other things.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Taymiyyah on Allaah's Ahadiyyah and Samadiyyah And A Refutation of Contempary Jahmee Baleeds Accusing Him Of Saying that Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> and <a href="tags/composite.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">composite</font></a></font>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>" (3/487-491):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-487-491.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The translation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>What makes this clear is that His Name al-Ahad negates that there is a likeness (mithl) for Him from anything from the things, for it (the Name al-Ahad) negates the false <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resemblance). And His Name as-Samad negates that separation (tafarruq) and divisibility (<a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>) - and whatever that comprises of composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) and corporeality (tajassud, something being a body)-  are permitted for Him. And this is because He, the Sublime, described Himself with as-Samadiyyah, just as He described (Himself) with al-Ahadiyyah, and He, the Sublime, "...<b>there is nothing like unto Him</b>..." in all of His Attributes. Rather, He is perfect in all His qualities just as nothing resembles Him in them, then He is also perfect in as-Samadiyyah, as He is perfect in al-Ahadiyyah.    <P>
And "al-waahid" (i.e. a single entity) from the creation can be described as being "one (waahid)", as He said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> ...And if she is one (<u>waahidah</u>) ... (an-Nisaa 4:11) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And (a single entity) can also be described as "al-ahad" restrictedly, or unrestrictedly, as in His saying:  <blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b>     <P>
...So let one of us (<u>ahadunaa</u>) take his place... (Yusuf 12:78) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
and    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> ... When one of them (<u>ahuduhum</u>) is brought news of a female (i.e. daughter)... (Nahl 16:58) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
and    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> ...And there is none (<u>ahad</u>) that is co-equal to Him... (Ikhlaas 112:4) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And (the single entity from the creation) can also be described as as-Samad, and as Yahyaa bin Abi Katheer said    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Angels are Samad (have no interior and require no food), and the humans are Jawf (have interior and require food).</blockquote>    <P>
and just as the poet said:    <P>
<div align=center><i>Let the announcer (of deaths) hasten with the (announcing) of the best of Bani Asad. With Amr bin Mas'ood and with as-Sayyid as-Samad.</i></div>    <P>
And as (the poet) said:    <P>
<div align=center><i>And you are as-Sayyid as-Samad</i></div>    <P>
And thus, when there is the meaning of oneness (al-wahdah) and the meaning of samadiyyah in the servant alongside (the fact) that he is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) amongst the bodies, then it is known that the existing thing being considered a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) does not prevent it from (also) being (at the same time) "<u>waahid (one)</u>", and that it is "<u>one (ahad) of</u>" the bodies, and that it is "samad" - in a similar way to it's being a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) not preventing it from being living (hayy), knowing (aalim), able (qaadir).    <P>
However, the servant does not have in any of his attributes the perfection which Allaah rightly deserves (in His Attributes), and not even close to that. For Allaah, the Most High, when He is described as being "waahid" (one) and "samad" (with no interior, perfect in all his qualities) and "aalim" (knowing), and "qaadir" (able) then in all of that lies the extremity of perfection in which nothing from amongst the things has any likeness to that in anything.    <P>
However, when the meanings that they (the Mutakallimoon) have mentioned, which they have considered to be "kathrah" (numerousness), and "adad" (number) and "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) are established for every existing (thing) - and this does not prevent [entities from] the creation [being referred to as]  "waahid" (one) - then how is that impossible, that the Deity to whom there is no likeness should also be "ahad" (one)?!</blockquote>    <P>
What <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> means is that the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (and the Philosophers) consider the affirmation of multiple meanings (attributes) for a single entity to be composition. However, Allaah has referred to people in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as "waahid" and "ahad" and "waheed", yet these are people described with attributes such as life, hearing, seeing, speech and so on. So <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying, if Allaah has referred to such entities as "waahid (one)", then how is it impossible for Allaah - alongside being described with attributes (which the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> deny to varying degrees) - to be describe with "ahad (one)".    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And this is made clear through the ninth angle: Which is that these meanings - which the heart knows that one of them are not the (same) as the other, is an unescapable matter, as has become known in all suppositions. And to negate this is to negate every existing thing, and it is the extremity of sophistry.</blockquote>    <P>
And what he means here is that the meaning of the attributes are different, so the heart knows "hearing" is other than "seeing" which are other than "knowledge" and so on. To deny this is pure sophistry. However, to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, this is considered "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) - that multiple meanings exist in a single entity.    <P>
