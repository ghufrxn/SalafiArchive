<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
In previous articles we detailed the attempted heinous intellectual fraud that was perpetrated by the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> going under the label of "Ash'aris" in their attempt to distinguish between the attributes of (<u>face, hands, eyes</u>) and (<u>hearing, seeing, knowledge, will, power, life, speech</u>) as it relates to Allaah, the Most High. You can read the details of that here: <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>the first part</a> and <a href=index321f.html?nkcmd>the second part</a>. In fact, we were kind enough <a href=indexb1e4.html?hwmnj>to craft a repentance for these people</a>, out of enjoining al-birr wat-taqwaa (piety and righteousness). To date, and its been thirty days since we exposed their intellectual fraud, we have had no response.     <P>
Thus this is a little reminder for them inshaa'Allaah:    <P>
<u><b>Firstly:</b></u> It is haraam to lie upon Allaah and His religion, and it is from the greatest of major sins. And it is also haraam to persist upon something that amounts to, in the end, a lie upon Allaah and His religion, even if it originated from one whom you deem to be a scholar, for he may have erred in that, but once the error is clearly highlighted, to persist upon that error amounts to lying against Allaah and His religion, with knowledge and intent. And Allaah has repeated His saying, "<b>And who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allaah ...</b>" many times in His Book (6:21,6:93,7:37,10:17,11:18,29:68,61:7) and anyone who claims that Allaah, or His Messenger (alayhis salaam), or Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan or Alee (radiallaahu anhum), or the Muhaajiroon, or the Ansaar, or the Companions in their entirety, or the Taabi'een, or those who followed them, or the Imaams, such as Abu Hanifah, Malik, Shaafi'ee, Ahmad, or any of the Salaf prior to 300H, or any of the early Kullaabi Ash'aris (such as <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, al-Qalaanisee, Ibn Mahdee at-Tabaree, al-Baqillani, al-Bayhaqi) <b>distinguished</b> between the attributes of (<u>face, hands, eyes</u>) and (<u>hearing, seeing, knowledge, will, power, life, speech</u>) - then he has invented a lie against Allaah, and has invented a lie against His religion, and has invented a lie against the Messenger (alayhis salaam) and against Abu Bakr, and Umar and Uthmaan and Alee, and the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar (radiallaahu anhum ajma'een) and the Companions as a whole and against the Taabi'een and against the Imaams of the Salaf of the second century, and the Salaf as a whole up to the third century, and against the early Kullaabi Ash'aris, and he  has uttered an enormous slander against all those who affirm these attributes of face, hands and eyes for Allaah without <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed - and his reckoning is with Allaah!    <P>
<b><u>Secondly:</u></b> It is haraam for you to associate yourself with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, and then to follow other than his creed, and at the same time to portray to the people that you are following <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>. This is fraud. And its a slander upon <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> for you to portray to the people that the creed you are on, is the creed of <u>Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari</u> (d. 324H) - for he was upon the Kullaabi creed of affirming Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> with His Essence, and affirming the attributes of face, hands and eyes <u>without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and without tafweed</u>. And slandering another Muslim with something he is free of, and which he does not hold as his religion before Allaah is haraam and a major sin - for by propounding your <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> creed of rejecting Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> in favour of the sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Kafirs like <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>), and in claiming the affirmation of face, hands and eyes for Allaah, without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed is <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, then you have slandered the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-asharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'aree</font></a>, free is he from you <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who tarnish his good name. For after abandoning the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, he adopted the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) and from this creed was to affirm <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> and His attributes which are the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a>, inclusive of face, hands and eyes. And this is what the likes of <u>Abu al-Abbaas al-Qalaanisee</u>, and <u>Ibn Mahdee at-Tabaree</u> (d. 380H), and <u><a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></u> (d. 403H), and <u>Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi</u> (d. 458H), the early Kullaabi Ash'aris, were upon - they affirmed these attributes (of face, hands, eyes) without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and without tafweed. And all of these scholar refuted and annihilated the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, that hand (<a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a>) means qudrah, or ni'mah (power, favour), and they affirmed that these are attributes of the essence, without asking how. <a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>See this section</a> for the articles detailing all of that.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for the depraved <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of today (posing as "<a href="tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a>"), then to them, these are  not attributes of Allaah, and they go as far as to claim it is "deception" to claim they are attributes - and refuge is from Allaah from such blindness in both vision and insight! <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>See their blindness here</a>.</div>    <P>
<b><u>Thirdly:</u></b> It is haraam for you to slander Muslims who affirm their belief in these attributes (face, hands, eyes) and their likes, with accusations of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, your predecessors in that being none other than the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - whom the early Kullaabi Ash'aris refuted, and they refuted them specifically upon this claim of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>.     <P>
Here, take a look at none other than perhaps the most instrumental, and important person in the actual formalization and existence of the Ash'ari madhhab itself, <u>al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani</u> - take a look at him smiting your faces and your lips, exposing your fraud, and throwing you in that same ditch along with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> you claim to oppose! In his book "<u>at-Tamheed al-Awaa'il</u>", (p.298), after bringing the proofs to affirm the attributes of face, hands, eyes for Allaah, and after rebutting the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, he then rebuts the accusation of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> that also came from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baqillan-attributes-tajseem.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if someone said: What has led you to deny that His Face and Hand is a limb when you do not understand hand as an attribute, and face as an attribute except [in the form of a] limb? It is said to him: <u>That is not necessitated</u>, just like it is not necessitated when we do not understand a living, knowing, able (being) except to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that we, us and you, should judge Allah with the same.    <P>
And just like it is not necessitated when He is established by His own Essence (qaa'iman bi dhaatihi) that He is <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and body just because we, and you, do not find anything established by itself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi) in what we (outwardly) observe except that it is like that (i.e. <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Substance</font></a> and body).    <P>
And the answer to them is likewise if they say: It becomes necessary that His <u>knowledge</u>, <u>life</u> and <u>speech</u> <b>and all of His attributes belonging to His Essence (dhaat)</b> are non-essential incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), genuses, or occurrences (hawaadith), or changes, or coalesce (merge) in Him, or are in requirement of a heart, and they used the existence (wujood) [that they observe] as argument [in this regard].</blockquote>    <P>
And a read of the speech of Abu Bakr <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), another early Ash'ari, on this subject would be advised (<a href=indexbd8e.html?ezymy>see here</a>)!    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of today, then they either make ta'weels of these attributes with <u>the very ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah</u>, or they speak with the tafweed they innovated, through which they abolish the dhaahir of the revealed texts, and then claim Allaah knows best what the meaning is, and that the only thing they know is that there are a series of letters in the revealed texts which combine to make up the words "yad" or "wajh" and so on, and that they affirm these words exist in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (and that's their affirmation!) but Allaah knows best what they mean. Then, they claim this was the way of the Salaf! And when it is the case that even the early Kullaabi Ash'aris did not speak with tafweed for these attributes - then the Salaf are free of it in the first degree. However, when the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) saw the futility in <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and realized that it essentially amounts to uttering lies against Allaah, no matter how you try to justify it, they took tafweed as the effective means to deal with all those texts that conflicted with their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", those texts which in their view amounted to ascribing Allaah with "<a href="tags/araad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">a'raad</font></a>" (incidental attributes) and "hawaadith" (events, occurrences). Then they began to compile statements from the Salaf through which they made the claim that the way of the Salaf was tafweed, which is in reality ascribing ignorance (tajheel) to the Salaf. And you should know that from their fraud is that the reason why they need to make tafweed of revealed texts is to protect that Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-Arad, as Imaam Ibn Suraij as-Shaafi'ee (d. 306H) called it, and to protect their corrupt, flawed intellectual proof for demonstrating the universe is created from invalidation. <b>And the Salaf were not upon that baatil (falsehood) such that they needed to resort to tafweed</b>. So take note of this and we shall expand upon their fraud regarding "tafweed" in the future inshaa'Allaah with what leaves no doubt, by Allaah's permission, that tafweed is simply a mechanism for these <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> to deal with those texts that conflict with their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", after the way of "<a href="tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> proved to be inconsistent and ineffective, and then to make cover for themselves they went hunting for the sayings of the Salaf that would allow the imputation of this madhhab to the Salaf.</div>    <P>
<b>So we repeat our request for you to announce your tawbah and to abandon the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that you are peddling whilst fraudulently making out to the people that this is the deen of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and the early Kullaabi Ash'aris!</b>   <P>
