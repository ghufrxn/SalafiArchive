<font class='titleHeadline'>Cunning Raafidee Games the Ash'aris</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In <i>Minhaj al-Sunnah</i> (tahqeeq Muhammad Rashaad Saalim, 3/352-353), Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> cites the argument of Raafidee Ibn al-Mutahhir:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/cunning-rafidee-kalam-nafsee.jpg width="500" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have held the view that Allaah commands and prohibits us from eternity whilst there was no created being (present) with Him, saying, "<b>O Prophet, have taqwa of Allaah</b>" (33:1), "<b>O you who believe, have taqwa of Allaah</b>" (2:278), "<b>O mankind, have taqwa of your Lord</b>" (4:1). And if a man sat in a vacant, empty place without a servant being present with him and said, "<i>O Saalim, stand</i>", "<i>O Ghaanim, eat</i>", "<i>O Najaah, enter</i>" it would be said (to him), "Who are you calling out to?" and he replied, "<i>To servants that I wish to buy after twenty years from now</i>", then every sane (intelligent) person would impute foolishness and idiocy to him, so how then is it befitting from them that they ascribe (issuing commands and prohibitions) to Allaah in eternity? </blockquote>    <P>
Before we see <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> put the donkey in his place, it is important to provide some background to the above so the reader can appreciate what is going on. We have three points below, 1) a general historical note on <u>the Kalam Dynasty</u> (a bunch of families), 2) a specific historical note about Allaahs' speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and  3) the connection of this to the quote above.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Crucial Facts and Historical Review </font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>First: The "Kalam" Dynasty:</b> The conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> had affected and influenced the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in their theology. In their writings and heritage can be found what later become known as "<b><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>" amongst the Muslims (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>study this series</a> on <b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Ash'aris</b>). This heritage came to the Muslims through <b>al-Ja'd bin Dirham</b>, <b><a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a></b> (heads of the Jahmiyyah) and was transmitted subsequently through the <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, <u>Rafidah</u>, <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Maturidiyyah</u> and <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u> to the rest of the Ummah. This conceptual baggage is that of <i>jawaahir</i> (substances), <i>ajsaam</i> (bodies) and <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes). Using this terminology all these <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups were clinging to an alleged rational proof called "<u>hudooth al-ajsaam</u>" which argues that the presence of <i><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></i> (attributes) or <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes) or <i>hawaadith</i> (events) in the bodies and entities making up the universe proves they are originated and due to the claimed premise of <i>the impossibility of an endless chain of events in the past</i>, all bodies must have a beginning, proving the universe is originated and therefore has a Maker. When they argued this case, and made this argument to be something which the very truthfulness of the deen of Islaam rests (<u>a gross error</u>), they had to be consistent and make sure their theology (how they describe Allaah) remains consistent with the demonstration of this proof, leading them to their <b>Aristotelian Tawhid</b>, the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> characterized through the conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. In other words, Allaah is not a <i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i> (body), not a <i><a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a></i> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), not an <i><a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a></i> (incidental attribute), does not have a <i><a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a></i> (direction), is not in a <i>makaan</i> (place), does not have <i>fi'l</i> (action) and so on. Thus, their deity became spoken of exactly like the "<b>first cause</b>" identified by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in his <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> treatise (whose conceptual baggage they had used in the process) and which is reduce to an "<u>immaterial, unembodied, immutable</u>" being - a shorter way of saying a being from whom <u>the ten categories</u> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> are denied.    <P>
<hr size="1" color="#ababab">  <img src=assets/images/aristotle-right.gif align=right style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" border=0><u>These are the ten categories of Aristotle:</u> <b>Substance (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</b> referring to all the entities (bodies, beings, things) that make up the universe. Then every one of these bodies has nine incidental attributes through which it is characterized and they are:  <b>Quantity (al-kam)</b> - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on. <b>Quality (al-kayf)</b> - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on. <b>Relation (al-idaafah)</b> - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on. <b>Place (al-ayn)</b> - where it is. <b>Time (mataa)</b> answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>. <b>Position (al-wad')</b> - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other.  <b>Action (yaf'al)</b> acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing. <b>Affection (yanfa'il)</b> a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon, affected by other than it. <b>Having (al-mulk)</b> - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on.    <P>
Aristotle identified the "first cause" of the universe through an argument involving motion and rest, and on the basis of this classification of what is observed of bodies in the universe (the ten categories), he ended up with a deity that <i>in short</i> is summarized as "<u>immaterial, unembodied, immutable</u>" and <i>in more detail</i> as follows, as is found in his <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> 12 treatise:    <P>
"<b><i>The unmoved mover is infinite, since it causes infinite motion. It follows that it is also without magnitude, since an infinite force cannot reside in a finite magnitude (and there can be no infinite magnitudes); having no magnitude means that the first mover is indivisible, having no parts</i></b>", (now you know where the Mutakallimin get their statements such as "God does not occupy space, God does not have spatial extension" and so on). This unmoved mover is, "<b><i>eternal, unmovable and separate from sensible things</i></b>" (meaning cannot be perceived with the senses, and this is what <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought into the Ummah), and he also says, "<b><i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence. The reason that God can have no magnitude is that God produces motion through infinite time, which means that God must be infinite, since an infinite effect requires an infinite cause; but there cannot be such a thing as an infinitude magnitude. As being a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> without magnitude, God is without parts and, therefore, indivisible (magnitudes are divisible)</i></b>", and here in the next statement we see the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, where in <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> 12, we read "<b><i>the primary essence has no matter, which means that there can only be one God, since it is matter that differentiates one form or definition into many manifestations of that one form or definition.  Since God has no matter, then God is one not only formally or in definition, but also numerically</i></b>" and here is something else which is a parallel to the theology of the Mutakallimin, straight from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, "<b><i>It has been shown also that this primary essence cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible. But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of place</i></b>." This last statement alludes to what the Mutakallimin are upon of denying what they call <i>hawaadith</i> for Allaah, the denial of those matters tied to Allaah's will and choice which they call "events" and "changes" but which to Ahl al-Sunnah are Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>), a sign of His utmost perfection.    <P>
<b>Once this is clear, you will know exactly where the Ash'aris and Maturidis are coming from and where their theology is really derived from.</b>  <hr size="1" color="#ababab">    <P>
Using this Aristotelian conceptual baggage forced them to deny what Allaah described Himself with in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> of <u>names</u>, <u>attributes</u> and <u>actions</u>, and likewise what the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) described Him with, and this is when the rejection of certain major symbols of the Islamic aqidah appeared starting from the early 1st century hijrah. The error of these people is that they likened Allaah to His creation in the sense that whatever logical and rational necessities applied to the entitiese and bodies in the universe were assumed to also apply to Allaah's essence. Without this "bridge" between Allaah and the bodies that make up the universe, the theology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> has absolutely no foundation. In other words, they are saying: <b>Whatever rational and logical necessities apply to created bodies also apply to Allaah, such that if it is said that a created entity is said to be "above", it must necessitate it is a body, because direction implies embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>), and since Allaah is equivalent to all the created bodies in these rational necessities, then if it is said Allaah is "above" then it must necessitate embodiment for Allaah's essence as well, just like it does for created bodies. </b> So you can see here, that this vile repugnant <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> is in the very basis and foundation of their entire theology, and from this starting point, they are led to <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation) of attributes for Allaah. In other words, in order for their theology to exist and have any basis, they have to make this false analogy for Allaah, the Sublime. So from the major symbols of of Islamic belief they started to deny as a result of all of this:    <P>
<b>Denial of Allaah being above His Throne</b> (because direction implies place which implies occupation of space which implies spatial extension which implies embodiment which is kufr because it invalidates the proof for the origination of the universe). <b>Denial of Allaah being seen in the Hereafter</b> (because for something to be seen it must be in a direction, and direction implies place which implies occupation of space which implies spatial extension which implies embodiment which is kufr because it invalidates the proof for the origination of the universe). <b>Denial that Allaah speaks</b> because speech has instances which constitute events (<i>hawaadith</i>) that would render Allaah a body, hence the various approaches taken towards denial of speech for the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u> families and pretence of affirmation of it for the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Maturidiyyah</u> families. Because this whole approach is opposed to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and is founded upon the conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, it naturally follows that those people traversing upon this path will split into groups and excommunicate each other, because whatever is not from Allaah will comprise much conflict, splitting and differing (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1593;&#1616;&#1606;&#1583;&#1616; &#1594;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607;&#1616; &#1604;&#1614;&#1608;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610;&#1607;&#1616; &#1575;&#1582;&#1618;&#1578;&#1616;&#1604;&#1575;&#1614;&#1601;&#1611;&#1575; &#1603;&#1614;&#1579;&#1616;&#1610;&#1585;&#1575;&#1611;</span>), "<b>Had it been from other than All?h, they would surely have found therein much contradictions</b>" (4:82). And this is where domestic problems and abuse began to appear in the "<b>Kalam  Dynasty</b>", which is made up of the following major families: <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, <u>Rafidah Mujassimah</u>, <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u>.  Irreconcilable differences appeared amongst them and in-fighting was inevitable - some of them became <b>Mu'attilah</b> and some of them became <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b> - all on account of the same <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they had entered into. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <u>the pioneers</u>, were totally consistent with the requirements of this Aristotelian <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and the proof of <i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i> they built upon it and denied everything for Allaah. Hence, no names, attributes or actions because affirming any of this would render Allah a body which would then invalidate their proof that the universe is originated, because everything we see in the universe has names, attributes or actions. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> <u>turned effeminate</u>, lacking the boldness of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and outwardly affirmed names, whilst denying attributes and actions (labelling them as <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i>). The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> <u>turned effeminate</u> in relation to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and though they affirmed some attributes they followed <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in <u>his denial that Allaah has actions tied to His will</u> (as in Allaah speaking and acting as and when He wills), as this implies events (<i>hawaadith</i>) which would clash with their proof of <i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i>. So when these domestic problems appeared in the household, fights broke out, and they got a little nasty. They all differed with each other as to <b>what can and cannot be affirmed for Allaah, the Exalted, without invalidating the underlying proof (<i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i>)</b> upon which their entire theology rests. Hence, the different degrees to which they denied <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions, and the extent to which they were prepared to distort the Book of Allaah using the slogan of "<i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>", an approach that was not entirely satisfactory and consistent (because naturally they would have to argue with each other about which specific texts require <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and why, and what specific <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is it, and what is the evidence for it) and hence the later ones innovated the approach of "<i>tafweed</i>" and tried spuriously to ascribe it to the Salaf. It is from here that their vile perception towards the revealed texts emerged, namely that Allaah and His Mesenger were forced to use "<i>anthropomorphic</i>" language for the benefit of the <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>dumb commoners</a> who were not sophisticated enough to grasp the true language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (i.e. the language of Aristotle), and thus the Messenger very carefully and selectively spoke about Allaah's attributes and the job was then later left to the Mutakallimeen to define the true and real <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>  using the correct language for it (meaning Aristotle's language). This is something that you will find in the writings of the kafir <u><a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a></u> (d. 439H) (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>), <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u> (d. 505H) (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>) and <u><a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a></u> (d. 606H) (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>see here</a>).    <P>
<b>Second: The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Allah's Speech:</b> Now, one of the  major symbols of Islamic belief to be impacted by this Hellenized theology is the issue of <u>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Allah's speech</u>. Whilst united that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created these Kalam families had internal schisms based upon the level and extent of their negation (<a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>). So the pioneers, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, they said: Allaah does not have any attributes, including speech, as it is an <i><a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a></i> (incidental attribute) and ascribing it to Allaah would render Him a body. Since, Allaah does not have speech, then this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is just something created, its not His speech. Then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who turned a little effeminate and weren't so bold and brave as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, they said: Allaah does have speech, but it is not an attribute of His essence (hence He is not a body), rather, His (attribute of) speech is what He creates in others of speech and hence we say "the speech of Allaah", just like we say, "the Messenger of Allaah", "the House of Allaah" and so on. So this was the Mu'tazili family's solution to keep in line with that conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a>. Then along came <b><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></b> and he was in a sticky situation. He debated a great deal with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. He wanted to affirm speech, but could not escape the arguments of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against him, which is that if Allaah speaks (<u>according to His will</u>), or does any act according to His will, then He is subject to events (<i>hawaadith</i>), and must be a body. So <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> sought a way to deal with this, and, upon some alleged poetry of a <u>Trinitarian Christian</u> called <b><a href='tags/al-akhtal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Akhtal</font></a></b> (<a href=index519a.html?flvgl>see here</a>), he simply played around with the definition of <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> (speeech) in Arabic, and claimed that <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> is only the meaning in the self, and not the actual <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> and words, and this was labelled as "<i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>". From here, he said that Allaah does have speech, but it is just one single eternal meaning present with the self of Allaah (like the other attributes of knowledge, life). So Allaah's speech now became one eternal meaning, and was not tied to Allah's choice and will. Then he said that <u>the Arabic Qur'an</u> is not the eternal attribute of speech but a created citation (or expression as the Ash'aris later said) of the uncreated meaning present eternally with Allaah's self. In this way, he found a response to the arguments of the Mu'tazili family. He found a way to affirm the attribute of speech without it necessitating events (hawaadith). This was the creed that was taken and adopted by the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi families. However, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> came back with a vengeance and slapped this doctrine into intellectual oblivion (<a href=index2cfa.html?zjxdz>read this article</a>: <b>How the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Slapped the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Into Intellectual Oblivion and Made Mockery of Their Intelligence - Between The Multiplicity of Attributes and the Doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Nafsee</b>).     <P>
<b>Third: Implications on This Which Leads us to the Cunningness of the Raafidee:</b> So far, we have shown the historical development of the position taken by the Ash'aris and Maturidis regarding Allaah's speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Now the implications of this is that since the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> contains commands and prohibitions, then the solution provided by the Ash'aris and Maturidis (borrowed from the Kullaabiyyah) means that Allaah was issuing commands and prohibitions to a non-existent creation, because if they claim that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is part of a singular eternal undivisible attribute in the self of Allaah which they refer to as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, then everything that is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, of all the stories, all of Allaah's speech that Allaah ascribes to Himself and likewise commands and prohibitions, it was in "pre-eternity", in the absence of those being commanded and prohibited.   </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Cunning Rafidee Mocks the Intellects of Ash'aris (and Maturidis)</font>    <P>
<blockquote>The scene is now set for us to understand the  nature of the Raafidee mocking the intellects of the Ash'aris and before we go any further, keep in mind that the Raafidah, since the latter part of the second century, they gradually adopted the school of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the attributes of Allaah, essentially, they married into the Kalam family, and this is why you find this particular Raafidee, <a href='tags/ibn-al-mutahhir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Al-Mutahhir</font></a>, having beef with the Ash'aris, because he is a Mu'tazili in doctrine. So lets revisit the quote again:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have held the view that Allaah commands and prohibits us from eternity whilst there was no created being (present) with Him, saying, "<b>O Prophet, have taqwa of Allaah</b>" (33:1), "<b>O you who believe, have taqwa of Allaah</b>" (2:278), "<b>O mankind, have taqwa of your Lord</b>" (4:1). And if a man sat in a vacant, empty place without a servant being present with him and said, "<i>O Saalim, stand</i>", "<i>O Ghaanim, eat</i>", "<i>O Najaah, enter</i>" it would be said (to him), "Who are you calling out to?" and he replied, "<i>To servants that I wish to buy after twenty years from now</i>", then every sane (intelligent) person would impute foolishness and idiocy to him, so how then is it befitting from them that they ascribe (issuing commands and prohibitions) to Allaah in eternity? </blockquote>    <P>
The matter should be clear. In light of the background and history above, it should be clear, he is mocking the <i>'uqool</i> (intellects) of the Ash'aris, he is mocking their solution to the problem of avoiding affirming <i>hawaadith</i> (events) for Allaah, and he is coming from the angle that affirming attributes for Allaah is shirk, because the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> deny all attributes, and so he is mocking these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> for the way in which they tackled this problem of the attribute of speech. He is saying that you have likened Allaah to a man who has no servants, and he sits alone issuing commands, "Zayd do this", "Abdullah do that", "Khaalid do this" and then when he is asked "Who are you addressing" he says "I am ordering my servants who I intend to buy thirty years from now" and through this he is mocking their belief that there was no creation and Allaah was issuing commands and prohibitions.     <P>
Now we can illustrate this more clearly by taking a passage from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and illustrating the type of argument the Raafidee is using and which actually has some validity :    <P>
<blockquote>Let's take Surah al-Baqarah (2:67 onwards) - and let's assume the correctness of the doctrine of "<b><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></b>" of the Kullabi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi families from the "<u>Kalam Dynasty</u>". Allaah, the Exalted says: (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1614;&#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1618; &#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614; &#1605;&#1615;&#1608;&#1587;&#1614;&#1609; &#1604;&#1616;&#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607;&#1614; &#1610;&#1614;&#1571;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1585;&#1615;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618; &#1578;&#1614;&#1584;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1576;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1577;&#1611;</span>) <b>[Remember] When Moses said to his people, "Indeed Allaah commands you to slaughter a cow...</b>" So Allaah exists, no creation, no Moses, no Jews, and no cow to slaughter in existence alongside the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> from eternity. And Allaah uses the particle "<i>idh</i>", along with a verb in the past tense "<i>qaala</i>" referring to Allah, the Exalted, stating about Moses who (in the perfect tense) said that Allaah "commands", so the command had obviously been communicated to ... yes... a non-existent Moses, who was conveying it to the non-existent Jews. So then the non-existent Jews kept asking as yet non-existent questions, being pedantic, what type of [non-existent] cow and how old and what color and so on. So Allaah says, in the past tense, that the [non-existent] Jews said to [the non-existent] Moses: (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1575;&#1583;&#1618;&#1593;&#1615; &#1604;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1617;&#1603;&#1614; &#1610;&#1615;&#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1616;&#1617;&#1606; &#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1607;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;</span>) <b>They said, "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!"</b> And the [non-existent] Jews repeated this [non-existent] question three times, and [the non-existent] Moses responded three times with [what was from eternity the non-existent saying of a non-existent Moses]:(<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1610;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1604;&#1615;</span>) <b>He (Moses) said: "He (Allaah) says...</b>" So [upon the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> doctrine] no Moses, no Jews, no cow, the non-existent Moses had supplicated three times to Allaah the Exalted and Allaah the Exalted had responded three times to a non-existent Moses explaining the nature of the non-existent cow that ought to be slaughtered by the non-existent Jews. And Allaah said about the non-existent Moses, "<i>qaala</i>", meaning "He (the non-existent Moses) said..." - that's in the past tense, that "<b>Innahu yaqoolu</b>", referring to Allaah Himself that "<b>He (Allaah) is saying ...</b>". So to get this right, Allaah the Sublime said in pre-eternity <u>in the past tense</u>, that a non-existent Moses had said (qaala, in the past tense) that Allaah is now saying (<i>yaqoolu</i> in the present tense) regarding what the non-existent Jews had said (<i>qaaloo</i>) in the past tense ... And after all of this to-ing and fro-ing in the past and present tense and between the non-existent Moses and the non-existent Jews, the Jews eventually did slaughter the non-existent cow: (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1606;&#1614; &#1580;&#1616;&#1574;&#1618;&#1578;&#1614; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1614;&#1602;&#1616;&#1617; &#1601;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1615;&#1608;&#1607;&#1614;&#1575; &#1608;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1610;&#1614;&#1601;&#1618;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span>) <b>They said (to Moses), "Now you have brought the truth." So <u>they slaughtered it</u> though they were near to not doing it.</b> So Allaah says in the past tense, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1615;&#1608;&#1607;&#1614;&#1575;</span>), that these non-existent Jews, slaughtered the non-existent cow, and the final part of the verse, "<b>though they were near to not doing it</b>" establishes that the non-existent act had certainly been completed by non-existent Jews and a non-existent cow.     <P>
Now if it is claimed that all of this is simply Allaah's "knowledge" that resides with His self of the events that are to transpire when He creates the creation, then this would invalidate the attribute of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" because this now is simply the attribute of knowledge (<i>ilm</i>). And as such <u>the difference between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'aris</u> simply becomes <u>one of wording only</u>, because the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say we believe Allaah has knowledge and wish (ilm and iraadah) <i>but they are synonymous with His essence</i>, and the Ash'aris say Allah has <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, and when forced to explain the <i>akhbaar</i> (information) and <i>awaamir</i> (commands) in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they are forced to treat them as <i>ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>iraadah</i> (wish) respectively, and so in reality, there is no attribute of "<b>kalam</b>" with Allaah, it is just His knowledge and wish. And for this reason, <u>the honest, truthful ones</u> from amongst the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, readily acknowledge this and here are some articles you can read to verify yourself: <b>Imaam ul-Haramayn <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created - We Just Differ on a Matter of Wording Which Is On Account Of What Can We Call Allaah 'Mutakallim' (One Who Speaks) - (<a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>see here</a>). <b>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti</b>: We (The Ash'aris) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are United that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Is Created And What the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Call 'Knowledge (al-Ilm)' and 'Will (al-Iraadah)', We Simply Call 'al-Kalaam an-Nafsee' - (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see here</a>). <b>Fakhr ud-Deen <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the (Recited) <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created And Our Dispute Is One of Wording Only - (<a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>see here</a>).

And this, O dear reader, is the type of fooling and playing around which is necessitated by the people of falsehood who speak with innovated sayings in belief that none of the Salaf ever spoke with - and we seek refuge in Allaah from what their sayings necessitate, and lofty and exalted is Allaah from all of that with a lofty exaltation!

Here <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is defending the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> view, <u>even though it is false and misguided</u>, relative to the Mu'tazili view, because to affirm that the Lord speaks with <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>, as the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> believe, and may address a non-existent being whose existence is yet to come is closer to reason than affirming a Lord that does not speak at all or a Lord that has no attributes, or a Lord who is ascribed attributes which He creates in others. After this passage, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> further addresses the argument of this Raafidee against the Ash'aris by demonstrating that <b>even though it is falsehood</b> (i.e. the Kullaabi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> doctrine of <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>), it can still be explained in a way to remove the claimed absurdity, making it far better than the position of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who deny speech is attributed to Allaah's self.   </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes</font>    <P>
<blockquote>With the Raafidah on one side and all other factions on the other, the Raafidah use aberrations (errors in belief) found with those besides them as a tool to justify their own madhhab of rejecting the imaamship of the three caliphs and other foundations of their belief. However, the Raafidah are <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and hence, their attempts to argue for the correctness of their doctrine of Imaamah regarding Alee (radiallaahu anhu) through the mistakes that are the mistakes of the Ash'aris, who though misguided, are not as misguided as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, then this is from the reasoning and intellect of a donkey. Meaning, that he faults the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> doctrines which even if false are closer to reason than the doctrines of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to which he subscribes, so he uses that which is less misguided (even though he holds something even more misguided on the same issue) and then uses it as an argument for the <u>non-related doctrine</u> of the Imaamah of Alee (radiallaahu anhu)! All people can see the stupidity of this Raafidee reasoning.    <P>
Also, and more importantly, notice how <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> defends the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> against the Raafidah (<a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>) and in general, Ibn Taymiyyah's works in the field of the names and attributes are from the angle that <b>the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> made great errors in arguing for the foundations of the religion</b> and this allowed the enemies of Islaam, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, to assault them and the Islamic creed when they saw errors and what opposed reason in the polemics of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and so <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> entered the field to aid an army that is disadvantaged and in strife, so he pointed out the flaws in the arguments of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, showing they used faulty goods, showed them how to use the best goods (weapons) from the Book and the Sunnah, and also demolished the weapons of their enemies and the enemies of Islaam, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and annihilated their claims of eternal matter, negation of the reality of prophethood and other issues of debate.    <P>
<b>Despite this, these people today, the Ash'aris, are very ungrateful (and ignorant)</b>. They are really <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u> and not followers of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, because they are not upon the doctrines of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>  he held at the end of his life and found in his books <i>al-Maqaalaat</i>, <i>Risaalah ilaal Ahl al-Thughar</i>, and <i>al-Ibaanah</i>.  Rather in many cases they are upon the doctrines of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in opposition to what <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, al-Qalanisee and many others from the early Kullaabis and Ash'aris.  </blockquote> <P>
