<div class="articleContent">






<p>The foundational principle of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah is their proof for the rational demonstration of the createdness of the universe, which in turn proves the Creator. This is the basis of their religion. For more details on this, <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>you need to read this article</a>.    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in his book "an-Nubuwwaat" - a refutation of al-Baqillani on some of his views on the subject of Prophethood and Miracles - so he said in Volume 1, page 255 (tahqeeq by at-Tawiyaan):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the intent here is that these (people) they made this to be the foundation of their religion and their faith, and they made inspection (an-nadhar) of this evidence to be an obligatory consideration upon every single person (mukallaf), and (they held) that anyone who does not look into this evidence, then either his faith is invalid, and as such he is a disbeliever - based upon the view of one faction amongst them - or he is sinful upon the saying of others, or he is a blind-follower who has no knowledge of his religion, but his blind-following will benefit him, and he will become a believer through it, without being disobedient.    <P>
And all three sayings are futile, because they branch off from a foundation which (is itself) futile - which is that (to them) the inspection, reflection (an-nadhar) which is the foundation of the religion, is this inspection of this evidence (i.e. their rational demonstration through <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> and hudooth).  The scholars of the Muslims know by necessity that the Messenger did not call the creation to this reflection (nadhar), and nor (call them) by this evidence, neither the generality of the creation, and nor the specific ones amongst them. Thus it is impossible for this to be a condition for faith and knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
What is this evidence? It is the evidence that demonstrates the created nature of the universe through the use of basic underlying notions (borrowed from the Greek philosophers) such as Aristotle's <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), and the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> theory (the indivisible particle). And it is called "<b><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></b>", a specific and intricate rational demonstration of the createdness of the universe that these people made binding. We have covered this elsewhere and you should <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>go through this article</a> where it is mentioned in more detail.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style="font-size:21px;line-height:28px;">The foundational principle of the deen of the Mu'attilah (Negators of the Attributes) is the rational demonstration of "<b><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></b>" (the createdness of bodies) by way of their being subject to "a'raad and hawaadith" (incidental attributes and events) and most of their other usool branch off from this foundation - and in this the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are united with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (the latter two being the source of this approach) - they only differ on subsidiary issues, after their agreement on the basic principle.</font></div>    <P>
And this became the foundational principle of the entire religion to these people (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) - and around this foundational principle did they build their formulation of their creed - and thus they fell into what they fell into. And when they say "Usool ud-Deen", the foundations of the religion, this is what they mean by it - the rational validation of their faith, and in this they have simply "borrowed" or been influenced by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - with subsidiary differences that they argue upon.     <P>
The verifier (of "an-Nubuwwaat") brings some quotations from the Ash'arite <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (<a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>) in the notes and a quote from Abu Mansoor al-Maaatureedee:    <P>
From al-Maatureedee in "at-Tawheed" (p. 129):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is no path to knowledge of Him, except through [the method] of the [rational demonstration of the] universe providing evidence for Him...</blockquote>    <P>
And what they mean here is their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology, what they have laid down as being the rational demonstration of the createdness of the universe.    <P>
And Abu Hamid al-Ghazaalee in "Tahaafut al-Falaasifah" (p.197):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...So it has become clear that anyone who does not believe in "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", then there is no basis for his belief in the creator, fundamentally (i.e. at all)...</blockquote>    <P>
And as-Saawee says in "Sharh Jawharat ut-Tawheed" (p.61):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... And the truth that is to be depended upon is that he is a believer, but sinful by abandoning reflection (an-nadhar)...</blockquote>    <P>
He means a person who does not inspect and look at this rational proof of theirs by way of the createdness of bodies through the demonstration of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events, occurrences).    <P>
And <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> makes this "nadhar" (argument by way of rational evidence through inspection) to be the first obligation, and he declares it obligatory upon each person to know the specifics of this rational demonstration, as occurs in his book "al-Insaaf" and also in "at-Tamheed".    <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (another prominent Ash'ari Scholar) holds it to be obligatory as indicated in the book "ash-Shaamil Fee Usool ud-Deen", as does Abu Ishaaq al-Isfaraa'eenee in the book "Sharh  ul-Maqaasid".     <P>
And Abdul-Qahir al-Baghdadi, another prominent Ash'ari scholar makes the rational and intellectual inspection to be a condition for the validity of a person's faith.    <P>
He says in "Usool ud-Deen" (p.269):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> From [being] a condition of the validity of faith - in our view [meaning the Ash'ariyyah] - is preceding knowledge with the intellectual foundations in Tawheed, Hikmah and 'Adl, and (in) establishing the Prophethood and Messengership, and belief (in) the Sharee'ah of islaam...</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (al-Imaam ul-Haramayn) says in "ash-Shaamil Fee Usool id-Deen" (p. 115):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Observation (an-nadhar) and inference (al-istidlaal) that lead to acquaintance of Allaah, the Sublime, are two obligations...</blockquote>    <P>
And what they mean by inspection and deduction of evidence is their rational demonstration, through their rational proof of <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>.    <P>
This view is held by the  majority of the Ash'arite <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> - and there others who do not hold it to be obligatory or a condition of the validity of faith, but it is a position held by the majority of them.    <P>
And some of them speak of the disbelief (kufr) of the one who does not go into this inspection and deduction of evidence, whilst having had time to do that.     <P>
Al-Juwaynee says in "ash-Shaamil fee Usool id-Deen" (p. 122):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/juwaynee-nadhar-kafarah.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... And if time passed by - from the time that religious obligations applied to him - in which he had the capacity for an-nadhar (inspection and deduction of proof, rationally) leading to knowledge, and he did not inspect, despite there being no preventive barriers and he passed away after the time in which this was possible for him - then he is put alongside the disbelievers...</blockquote>    <P>
So some of them went to extremes as you can see.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, when they say that inspection and deduction of evidence is obligatory (an-nadhar wal-istidlaal), they include both Sharee'ah and intellectual forms of inspection and deduction of evidence, but in practical terms, what they mean is the rational intellectual arguments that they have devised, as this is what forms the foundational basis of their creed, and this is clear from all their books in that they consistently bring the issues of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) (which is what their rational demonstration is based upon) as introductory and fundamental issues underlying their creed.     <P>
Then they have a range of differences amongst themselves on this foundational issue, differing on issues such as is it fard 'ayn upon everyone or not, and is their method of <a href='tags/nadhr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>nadhr</font></a> and <a href='tags/istidlaal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istidlaal</font></a> the only way to arrive at knowledge (of Allaah) and of the correctness of Propethood, and is a person sinful or not for not using it and so on.    <P>
And if the Sharee'ah method had been sufficient, they would not have needed to use <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, and <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>. And they cannot claim that this method of theirs is from the Sharee'ah since the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) never called to it, nor did any of the Companions, nor any of the Taabi'een, nor any of the Salaf - rather its origin lies in the Imaams of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and whoever took it from them.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani's Refutation of the Ash'aris on This Issue</font>    <P>
Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani documented this view of the Ash'aris and refuted it with just a single verse and hadeeth. <a href=index2047.html?osliq>You can see that here</a>. And Abu Ja'far as-Simnaanee, a prominent Ash'ari, turned away from the above view of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> as <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> explains, and he held on to this verse and hadeeth as proof to show that the ma'rifah (innate knowledge) of Allaah is in the fitrah already, and thus a person with intact sound fitrah does not need the rational demonstration that the Mu'tazilites and <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> concocted. And Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani quotes the saying of as-Simnaanee (Fath ul-Baree 13/97):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...<b>one of the issues of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that remained in the (Ash'ari) madhhab</b>...</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imaam an-Nawawee's Refutation of the Asha'rite <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> on This Issue</font>    <P>
Commenting on the hadeeth, "<i>I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah (alone) and until they believe in me and what I have brought</i>..." (Saheeh Muslim), an-Nawawee says in his Sharh of Saheeh Muslim (1/210-211):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nawawee-nadhar-radd.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> In (the hadeeth) is a clear evidence for the madhhab of the muhaqqiqeen (those verifying what is correct) and the majority amongst the Salaf and the Khalaf that when a person believes in the religion of Islaam with a firm and resolute belief devoid of any doubt, that this is sufficient for him, and he is a believer amongst the Muhawahhideen. [And that] it is not obligatory upon him to learn the evidences of the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> and knowing Allaah, the Exalted, through them. [This being] in opposition to the one who made it obligatory and made it a condition of a person being from the the people of the qiblah [and who] claimed that he does not have the ruling [applicable to] the Muslims except through this. And this madhhab is the saying of many of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and some of our associates, the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (<a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>), and it is a manifest error...</blockquote>    <P>
So it is apparent that the Ash'aris simply "borrowed" (again) from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, or were influenced by them in their foundations. And this is why it is said, the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are the effeminates (eunuchs) of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - being neither here nor there. And amongst themselves they differ in the details of this foundational principle of their madhhab - the issue of an-nadhar wal-istidlaal and their rational demonstration through "<b><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></b>". <P>
