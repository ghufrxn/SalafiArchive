<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Prominent Later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> (d. 895H) on <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) and the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Shaykhs Warning From His Books And His Mentioning of Poetry From Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> With His Isnaad Regarding <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> And One Of His Books!</font>    <P>
As-Sanusi (d. 895H) is one of the later <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> who has some works that are held in high regard by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and which are study manuals for them. In this article, we want to highlight that many <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> warned from the books of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> because in attempting to refute Ahl us-Sunnah in their belief that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above His creation, <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> unscrupulously gathered together the doubts and arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - just to prove that point - even if it meant that the arguments he used would invalidate his own (<a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a>) creed in other areas. For this reason, he was criticized and rebuked and his books warned against by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who came after him.    <P>
Here is the cover to his book "Sharh al-Kubraa", which is an Egyptian print dated just before 1900, just before the turn of the 20th century:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sharh-as-sanoosiyyah-al-kubraa-cover.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
On page 22-23 of this book <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> says about Fakhr ud-Din ar-Razi:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sanussi-on-razi-sharh-kubraa.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it could be plausible that the reason for his supplication with this is what he knew of his condition of craving to memorize the opinions of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the People of Desires and propagation of their doubts and his strengthening their citation alongside his weakness in determining the reply to many of them - based upon what is apparent from his authorship. And they pilfered him (i.e. won him over) in some beliefs, and he departed (getting) close to their abominable desires. For this reason, the Shaykhs warn from looking into much of his authorship.    <P>
The Shaykh Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Muqri at-Tilmisani (may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him) said, "Whoever ascertained the speech of Ibn al-Khateeb (i.e. ar-Razi) will find him stronger in corroborating the doubts than in separating from them (i.e. in repelling them), and in this there is what is not hidden (of the warning against his books). My Shaykh, Abu Abdullah al-Iblee recited poetry to me, saying: Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibraheem az-Zamuri recited poetry to me, saying: Taqi ud-Din <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> recited some poetry of his to me, saying:    <P>
<div align=center><i>"Muhassal Fee Usool ud-Din",  and his "Haasil"<BR>  And his "Tahseel", it is knowledge without religion<BR>  The foundation of misguidance is in manifest falsehood<BR>  For whatever is in it, then most of is the inspiration of the devils</i></div>    <P>
He (as-Zamuri) said: And in his hand he (<a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) had a  staff and he said, "If I reached Fakhr ud-Din I would have beaten him on his head with my staff" End (of quote). </blockquote>    <P>
Here we have a prominent figure of the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>  saying that the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> Shaykhs warned from the books of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> due to his being confused and mixed up with the doubts of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and he even brings, with his isnaad, some poetry from Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> about one of the books of ar-Raazee, "Mahsul Fee Usool ud-Din", and also alluding to two other books (of ar-Razi's students) through the words "Haasil" and "Tahseel". And the poetry of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> means that anyone acquiring and going through the book of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, and the other two books, will simply gain knowledge but lose his religion, and most of what is in them is plain falsehood and inspired by the devils.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As-Sanusi (d. 895H) quoting with his isnaad from Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> some poetry in reprimand of the authorship of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and today we see unscrupulous Jahmee Baleeds slandering and reviling <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> based upon the arguments devised by <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> which the latter has borrowed from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - the very same ones for which <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> goes on to rebuke him for (see article links at the end).</div>    <P>
The point being here that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, in his book "Asaas ut-Taqdees" which <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> refuted, brought the doubts of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and in particular he has employed elements of the proof through composition (at-tarkeeb) which is what the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> use to establish a Maker for the universe, however this same proof is used to negate any and all attributes for Allaah, because they claim they necessitate the present of distinguishable parts (ajzaa') within the Essence, and thus render Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>For more on this subject you can refer to these articles: <a href=index11b6.html?iwemr >here</a> and <a href=indexc0fc.html?xoqtx>here</a> and <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>here</a>.</div>    <P>
For the record it should be pointed out that <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> being an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and propounding a creed based upon the notions of "al-jawhar wal-'arad" would not agree with much of the creed of the Salaf,  the Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, and thus his quotation from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in this context only shows the great reprimand with which <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> was subject to and not that <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> was in agreement with Ibn Taymiyyah's creed of affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence which is the creed of the entirety of the Salaf (al-Qurtubi: <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>see here</a>) and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (<a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>see here</a>). <P>
