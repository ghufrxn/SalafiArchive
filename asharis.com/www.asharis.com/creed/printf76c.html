<p>All praise is due to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds and may the prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger, to proceed.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
In many previous articles we have explained that <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> concocted an intellectual, rational proof to demonstrate the existence of a Creator to some Indian Materialist Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> called the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> who had confused him initially. His intellectual proof was based around bodies (ajsaam) being created because of the qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith) in them, and he was the first to utilize this proof, albeit in a cruder form than did the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who simply refined it, cleaned it up and tried to fill the holes in it through incorporating the notion of <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle) into it, and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> simply "borrowed" it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
It was on account of the intellectual proof that <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> devised that he was forced to speak with the following, amongst many other things:    <P>
<ul><li><u>That Allaah did not speak to Moses</u> - because it would mean an event in Allaah's Essence, and thus making Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying His proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That the Qur'aan is created</u> - because if Allaah spoke it, it would be an occurrence or an incidental attribute, thus rendering Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying his proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter</u> - because if He could be seen, it would be in a direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>), as things are only see in direction, and this would make Him a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus falsifying his proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah is not above the heaven</u> - because this would necessitate direction, and anything in direction must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus Allaah would be a body, and thus the proof would be falsified.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah cannot be described with anything that the creation is described with</u> - because all descriptions that we see are only found in bodies (ajsaam), thus Allaah cannot be described with anything, otherwise it would necessitate that He is a body.  </ul>    <P>
And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> much of their sayings and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> too were involved in debates with the Indian Materialist Philosphers. There occurs in the book  "Buhooth Fil-Milal wan-Nihal" (3/437), that debates with these Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, was something that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon also, the author speaking about the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And then the period of ar-Rasheed came (170H-193H) and history narrates about their vigour during his time, to such an extent that there were none who argued with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> besides them.</blockquote>    <P>
Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf (d. 235H), who was one of the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, refined this proof and formalized it, and then all of the other <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took it from al-Allaaf, and it became integral to the madhhab. As <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> was a Mu'tazili for most of his life, he was upon this, and the Ash'aris introduced some new concepts into it such as "al-'arad laa yabqaa zamaanayn" (an incidental attribute does not last for two instances of time) - in order to make up for the deficiencies in this proof, and in order to allow them to justify, from a rational point of view, the affirmation of (some of) the attributes, in opposition to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who accepted none.     <P>
And this proof can be seen in the work of al-Baqillani (d. 403H), "at-Tamheed", who is said to be the codifier of the early Ash'ari madhhab, as well as in all major Ash'arite textbooks.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Objective of This Article</font>    <P>
Our aim in this article is to simply document from primary Mu'tazili sources that <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (d. 235H), a head of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, was the very first one to use a formalized refined version of Jahm's crude version of the proof of the createdness of the universe against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. From this we will then see that the deen of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> is based around this same intellectual proof, with some minor differences in its subsidiary details, and as such, the only true and real difference between the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is on the subject of <b>what can and cannot be denied for Allaah in order to make sure that the intellectual proof is not invalidated</b>. Thus the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> denied that Allaah is described with Attributes, because to them, this invalidates the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", and the Ash'aris found a way to affirm, rationally (not textually), some of the attributes, and they modified their intellectual proof to accommodate this.     <P>
In reality, they simply adopted the deen of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and tried to concoct a rational explanation and justification of why affirming some attributes does not invalidate the intellectual proof, so they could find some means to argue against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Thus their speech that time (zamaan) too is broken down into indivisible units, and that "al-'arad laa yabqaa zamaanayn" (an incidental attribute) does not last two instances of time) - inshaa'Allaah we can make this the subject of another article, because it allows us to see how and why the Ash'aris affirmed some attributes as opposed to others, how they justified it, and how they avoided invalidating the intellectual proof, by adding some other principles to what they inherited from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In fact, this is the true and real underlying difference between all of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) - which is arguing about what can and cannot be denied for Allaah in order to keep the intellectual proof protected from invalidation. And thus all of them are Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, having <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and tajahhum to varying degrees. As for their refutations of each other, they are only on subsidiary issues.</div>    <P>
But as for the base and foundation, they all took it from <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a>, through succession, <u>and they are all agreed upon it</u>. And this is the Ilm ul-Kalaam that the Salaf condemned, and this is the Ilm ul-Kalaam that gave rise to the sayings that the Qur'aan is created and that Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter and there is no deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and so on.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar al-Mu'tazili on the <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> and The Proof of <a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></font>    <P>
Here is the cover to al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar's "Sharh Usool ul-Khamsah":    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qaadee-abdul-jabbar-usool-khamsah-cover.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is page 96, and he is speaking about the ways of establishing the createdness of the universe to prove Allaah's existence, having mentioned two already connected to ajsaam (bodies) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (their incidental attributes), he then says:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qaadee-abdul-jabbar-usool-khamsah-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the third angle, and this is the evidence that is depended upon, and the first one to seek evidence through it was Abu al-Hudhayl [al-Allaaf], and the other Shuyook [of the Mu'tazilah] followed him in that.</blockquote>    <P>
And then he summarizes it, saying, (and whatever is in square brackets are explanatory additions by us):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>That bodies (ajsaam) are not devoid of occurrences (hawaadith), and they never precede them, and whatever is not free of something new arising within it (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>) by having preceded it, it is necessary that it [too] is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (newly-arisen, created).    <P>
And this evidence is based upon four presumed claims:    <P>
<ul><li> The first: That within bodies there are four meanings, and they are: combination (ijtimaa), separation (iftiraaq), motion (harakah) and rest (sukoon) [these are referred to as akwaan, states of being].  <li> The second: That these meanings are newly-arisen (muhdathah) [meaning exist after having not existed]  <li> The third: That the body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) is never devoid of them [meaning the newly-arisen occurrences, which are the four akwaan]  <li> And the fourth: That since [they body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)] is never devoid of them, and nor does it precede them, then it is binding that it is newly-arisen (i.e. created) just like them [the four akwaan].  </ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> on the Proof of <a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></font>    <P>
All the major textbooks of the Ash'aris contain the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" upon the manner of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. This is a list of their major textbooks:    <P>
<ul><li>The books of al-Baqillani (d. 403H), "at-Tamheed" and "al-Insaaf"  <li> The book of Abdul-Qahir (Abu Mansur) al-Baghdadi (d. 429H), "Usool ud-Deen"  <li> "al-Farq Bayn al-Firaq" of Abdul Qahir (Abu Mansur) al-Baghdadi (d. 429H)  <li> "al-Ghunyah Fee Usool ud-Deen" of Abu Sa'd an-Neesabooree (d. 478H)  <li> "ash-Shaamil Fee Usool ud-Deen", of <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)  <li> "al-Irshaad" of <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)  <li> "Mahsul Afkaar il-Mutaqaddimeen wal-Muta'akhkhireen"  <li> "Lum' al-Adillah" of Abdul Malik <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)  <li> "al-Iqtisad fil-I'tiqaad" of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H)  <li> "Nihayat ul-Aqdaam" of ash-Shahrastani (d. 548H)  <li> "al-Arba'een fee Usool ud-Deen" of ar-Raazee (d. 606H)  <li> "Asaas ut-Taqdees" of ar-Raazee (d. 606H)  <li> "Ma'aalim Usool ud-Deen" of ar-Raazee (d. 606H)  <li> "al-Mawaaqif" of al-Eejee (d. 756H)  </ul>    <P>
Here we just want to give an example from al-Baqillani (d. 403) who was the first of those who ascribe to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> to put it down and codify it in his books. You should remember that the <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were the pioneers of this proof - and the Ash'aris simply "borrowed" it and refined it a little more. The Ash'ari creed is in fact just a mixture of the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> coupled with the attempts of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240) to reconcile those usool with the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah - be not in doubt about that, for it is the sure truth, and this has been and will be further demonstrated on this site in other articles.    <P>
Al-Baqillani writes in his "at-Tamheed", (pp. 41-43):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/al-baqillani-tamheed-hudooth-ul-ajsaam.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: Speech Regarding Affirmation of the Emergence of the Universe</b>    <P>
All of the universe, its high and its low, does not exit from [being] one of these two types, I mean, substances (al-jawaahir, meaning particles) and incidental attributes (al-a'raad), and in its entirety, it is newly-arisen (i.e. created), and the evidence for its emergence is what we have [previously] covered regarding the affirmation of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes found in bodies).    <P>
And the incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) are newly-arising occurrences (hawaadith), and the evidence for their emergence is the termination of motion (harakah) at the onset of rest (sukoon), because if (motion) was not terminated upon the onset of rest, then would have both been present in the body at the same time, and this would have necessitated that it is both moving and at rest at the same time, and this is from those things whose corruption (i.e. falsehood) is known by necessity.    <P>
And the evidence for the <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a> (bodies being newly-arisen, created) is that they do not precede the occurrences (hawaadith, meaning motion and rest), and are not found prior to them, and whatever does not precede that which is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (newly-occurring, created), then it is also mudhath just like it, since it will not be devoid of the [hawaadith] being present alongside it (its existence), or after its (existence), and both situations necessiate that it is newly-arisen itself.    <P>
And the proof that the body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) is not permitted to preceded the hawaadith (occurrences, meaning motion and rest, or combination and separation), is that we know by necessity that when it is present, then either is (individual) parts (i.e. the particles that constitute it) are touching and combined, or are distinct and separate. This is because there is no third situation between them being in contact or being separate, thus it is necessary that it cannot be correct for them to precede the occurrences (hawaadith, i.e.combination and separation) themselves. And whatever does not precede the newly-arisen occurrences, it is necessary that it itself is newly-arisen, since, when it is the case that the (body) is only present alongside the presence of these [occurrences] or after them, then whichever of the two affairs is established, it is necessary to judge by it for the createdness of bodies.</blockquote>    <P>
Al-Baqillani is simply following on with what was pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (as did all the Ash'aris - although Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself, after abandoning the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, declared this method to be an innovation) - and it was on account of this proof that they were forced to negate, to varying degrees, what Allaah described Himself with.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanation of the Above</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who preceded the Ash'arite <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> by up to two centuries - were much involved in debates with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and atheists that were found in the lands to which Islam spread. And as these groups did not affirm revelation, then these <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (those who indulged in this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) sought a proof by which they could argue for    <P>
<ul><li>the createdness of the universe, as opposed to it being eternal  <li>the existence of a creator therefore,  <li>and thereby the possibility (imkaan) of prophethood, and  <li>the possibility of resurrection. </ul>    <P>
And doing this <u>without</u> having to refer back to the revealed texts at all. meaning it had to be a purely intellectual proof, from beginning to end. As these things are the most basic foundations in leading a person to belief in a creator and what follows on from that, they sought a rational proof that would allow them to achieve this, and they thought that this has to be the most important fundamental basis of the religion itself,and this is what they call Usool ud-Deen, its their kalaamist theology based around these subjects.    <P>
Jahm bin Safwan used a crude form of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", demonstrating that because bodies have qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), this is a proof that they are newly-arisen, created. And there were many atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in the Muslim lands who were conversant with and who were upon the Philosophy of the Greeks and of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in particular and his classification of the universe into <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) and nine categories of incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), and together these were known as "al-maqaalaat al-ashar" (the ten sayings) to the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> who adopted this.     <P>
So the likes of Jahm (and the Mu'tazilah) utilized these notions to devise a proof against those atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took up this proof first used by Jahm, but they saw flaws in it and they introduced other elements into it, so they took the theory of "the indivisible particle" (al-jawhar al-fard, al-juz alladhee laa yatajazza') of <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (d. 370BC), another Greek Philosopher, and so they said that all bodies (ajsaam) are made up of indivisible particles and that  their incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) are present at the level of of this indivisible particle. And the Ash'aris took this from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> but differed with them on subsidiary issues and they invented other concepts which they used to incorporate into this intellectual proof, on account of which they argued against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. But with respect to the underlying root and foundation, they are all agreed upon its concepts - and this the spring and fountain of their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> - and which led them to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed.    <P>
So now we have the basics laid down, let us see through this rational explanation, and it works something like this. Let's take pebble and a pebble is what is defined as <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>), however, it is said to be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), since a body (according to some of the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> - they differ amongst themselves) is whatever is made up of at least two indivisible particles - so we have a pebble that is made up of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and we refer to it is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). Now this pebble has width, height, depth, texture, color, hardness and so on. These are incidental attributes of this pebble. And anything that is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) is surrounded by space, it exists in space and location, and in relation to other things it has direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>).    <P>
So according to their reasoning, all bodies (whatever we see around us in the universe) have undergone temporal incidental attributes. These are what are called (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) also called more formally as "accidents". And similarly bodies also have occurrences, or events (hawaadith) taking place in them, so say for example someone speaking, that's an event, an occurrence, something that happened after it did not. Or a leaf being at rest, then going through motion on so that's motion, an event, an occurrence. And these "accidents" also occur at the level of the smallest indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), and indivisible particles are subject to combination, separation, motion and rest, which are also <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events).    <P>
So you get the picture, all bodies have incidental attributes (like the height, skin color of a human) and those attributes which are temporal such as having a headache, or feeling sad for example - these are all called "<a href="tags/araad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">a'raad</font></a>" - those things which are temporary or non-essential. And there are other which are events, occurrences, things that take place after not having taken place in that body. So <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (occurrences) are proof - to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - that bodies are created, and this is their basis for demonstrating the createdness of the universe.    <P>
Now, not all bodies have the same <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes), that's why <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> mentioned all the different categories of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> that bodies have. And to give some examples: color, shape, taste, smell, heat, cold, wetness, dryness, texture, number, space, location, direction, width, height, depth, motion, rest and so on.    <P>
So - according to the refined version of the intellectual proof - all bodies have collectively a wide range of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes), but at the level of the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) - which the entire universe is made up of - according to them - <u>they needed to make the argument by way of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> that are common to every body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</u>, to every thing basically.    <P>
And so there are two sets of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> that they decided to use in developing the rational foundation for "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>":    <P>
<ul><li>combination (al-ijtimaa') and separation (al-iftiraaq) and  <li>motion (al-harakah) and rest (as-sukoon).</ul>    <P>
This means indivisible particles coming together after being separated, or separating after being combined, or being at motion after rest, or rest after motion. What this means is that, at the most basic level, we can use either of these two pairs of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> in our argument. We don't need to worry about color, wetness, dryness, depth and so on, because that is not true of all bodies, or particles. But what is common to them all is either of these two pairs of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes).     <P>
So this is what al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar, the Mu'tazili and al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, an early Ash'ari are talking about in what we have quoted from them above. They are talking about the finer detail in the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" that they are all united upon and which led them to reject, to different degrees, Allaah's Attributes. And the originator of this proof, or the first to use it was <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary and Conclusion</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are upon the Usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as it relates to the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", they simply inherited this from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> before them), and they made some minor modifications to it and improvised it a little with some new principles, to fill in the gaps and holes. The proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" is what unites all of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah), and a large part of their creed is tied to it and determined by it.    <P>
The proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" is a corrupt and false proof that actually proves the opposite of what it is set out to prove, and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> were wise to this, and so when they saw the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> use this proof, the door was opened up for them to attack the deen with strength and vigour. <P>
