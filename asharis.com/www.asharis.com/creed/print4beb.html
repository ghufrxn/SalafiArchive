<p>In his tafseer of the verse in Surah al-A'raaf (7:54), "<b>Then He ascended over the Throne</b>", <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> says:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qurtubi-salaf-istiwaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Translation of al-Qurtubi's Statement</font>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Most of the past (the early) and later [theologians] said, 'When it is necessary to purify the Creator (al-Baaree), the Sublime, from having direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>) and demarcation (tamayyuz), then from the requirements and necessary consequences of this, in the view of the generality of the past scholars and their later leaders, is to purify the Creator (al-Baaree) from having direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>). In their view, He is not in the direction of above. This is because to them, when Allaah is designated with direction, this would necessitate that He is restricted to a place (makaan) and a confine (hayyiz). (Subsequently), a place and a confine necessitate (for Him) (such) movement and stillness that is related to distinction (tamayyuz), transformation (taghayyur) and new occurrences (<a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a>) . <u>This is the saying of the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (mutakallimoon, the people of kalaam)</u>.    <P>
And the very first Salaf (may Allaah be pleased with them) never used speak with the negation of direction (al-jihah) and nor did they express that (negation). Rather, they, and all of them, spoke with affirmation of it (al-jihah) for Allaah, the Exalted, just as His Book spoke with it and His Messengers informed of it. <b>And not a single one of the Righteous Predecessors (as-Salaf us-Salih) denied that He ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, in reality (haqeeqatan)</b>. And <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> has been specified (with al-Istiwaa) because it is the greatest of His creations. <u>And they (the Salaf) [stated their] ignorance of the how (kayfiyyah) of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, for there is no one who knows its reality</u>. Imaam Malik said, may Allaah have mercy upon him, "Al-Istiwaa is known..." - meaning, in the language - "...and how (it is) is unknown, and asking about it is an innovation". And Umm Salamah, may Allaah be pleased with her, said the same. And this much is sufficient (on this issue) and whoever wishes more then he can refer to the relevant places in the books of the Scholars.</blockquote>    <P>
So it is clear from the above that <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> mentions that the way of the Salaf was different to the way of the mutakallimeen (<a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>), and that the Salaf never spoke with what the (later) <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> spoke with, and they affirmed that Allaah made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> in reality (haqeeqatan) - and that they only denied knowledge of how He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> - and he (<a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>) brought the saying of Imaam Malik within this context, indicating that the meaning of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> is known - and as he (<a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>) is speaking about the position of the Salaf, when <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> says "in the language" when quoting the famous statement of Imaam Malik, then that means that the Salaf understood what <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> meant and they affirmed it upon that meaning.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note: </b>Al-Qurtubi's use of the word "al-jihah" is not from the way of the Salaf, and those upon their way - since "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" is neither affirmed nor denied in the texts. And the way of the Salaf towards all such words is that the meanings behind them are investigated - in terms of what is intended. And thus, if by "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" it is meant that Allaah is confined within a space - as is typical of things in the creation - then this meaning is false, and if by "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" it is meant that Allaah is above the seven heavens, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, separate and distinct from the creation and thus it being impossible for Him to be enclosed by what we understand as space, then this meaning is correct. <u>And this is what Qurtubi means</u> when he says, "<i>And the very first Salaf (may Allaah be pleased with them) never used speak with the negation of direction (al-jihah) and nor did they express that. Rather, they, and all of them, spoke with affirmation of it (al-jihah) for Allaah, the Exalted, just as His Book spoke with it and His Messengers informed of it</i>" - as is clear to anyone who is free from desires ... and there is not a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari who reads the words of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> except that he is forced to acknowledge this ...  </div>    <P>
And in this, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (considered an Ash'ari) is just and fair in that he mentions the unequivocal position of the Salaf and contrasts it to that of the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>. And just as clear is what he mentions in his book "al-Asnaa" where he also discusses <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>as we have covered in a separate article</a>:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qurtubi-salaf-uluww-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And the translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the most clear of these sayings - even if I do not speak with it or choose it - is what the [Qur'anic] verses and Narrations manifestly (indicate) <u><b>that Allaah, the Sublime, is above His Throne</b></u>, just as He informed in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger, without asking how, <u><b>separate and distinct from all of his creation (baa'inun min jamee'i khalqihi)</b></u>. This is the sum of the madhhab of the righteous predecessors (as-salaf as-saalih) in that which the trustworthy narrators (ath-thiqaat) have transmitted from them.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is the same as what he said in his tafseer regarding <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> - that what is apparently manifest in the Book and the Sunnah and what the Salaf were clearly and manifestly upon was that Allaah is separate and distinct from His creation and that He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> in reality (haqeeqatan) and that He is above the creation.    <P>
And all of this is in addition to al-Qurtubi's ascribing to the most prominent amongst the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (that is <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself, and <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and also Ibn Fawrak) the affirmation of Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, with His Essence (bi dhaatihi) and that He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, in reality (haqeeqatan) as opposed to metaphorically. <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>You can see that article here</a>. <P>
