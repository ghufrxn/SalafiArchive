<p>The Ash'ari <a href='tags/competition-corner.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Competition Corner</font></a> at <a href=index.html>Asharis.Com</a>, is intended to foster better understanding about the Ash'arite creed and its underlying foundations. This is our second quiz question. If you feel really confident about your <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and want to give it a test, or you are looking to "polish up", why not participate? Details of how to do so are after the quiz question.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Competition Corner - Did Allaah Speak With Anything That Negates His Truthfulness?</font>    <P>
Take a look at the following verse:    <P>

<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Indeed Allaah has heard the statement of she (Khawlah bint Tha'labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad) concerning her husband (Aus bin As-Saamit), and complains to Allaah. And Allaah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Seer. (Al-Mujadilah 58:1) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
From these verses Allaah has affirmed, <u>in the past tense</u>, and with the particles "qad" (denoting completion of an act) and "laqad" (denoting completion of an act with emphasis) - that He heard (sami'a) the saying of she who disputes and of the saying of the Jews, and also affirmed <u>in the present tense</u> that He hears (yasma'u) the discussion (of she who disputes).    <P>
<b><u>Background Context to The Question</u></b>    <P>
Now recall that the Ash'ari creed is that <u>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is eternal (qadeem)</u> - and this is not the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah, it is the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> whom <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> followed and there is no one who said this before <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H), the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allaah's knowledge and Allaah's knowledge is eternal and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, whilst from His knowledge, is something that Allaah spoke as and when He willed. But the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> said that "the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is eternal"  and that  Allaah spoke it in eternity, once, without succession sequence (of its letters and words), and that Allaah <u>does not</u> have actions tied to His will and power which means it is not possible for Allaah to have instances of speech that can be said to be other than each other. As an Ash'ari you should be clear on these issues, and you should know them like the back of your hand. And you should also know that the reason why actions for Allaah tied to His will and power have to be rejected because it conflicts with and opposes that intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" which was used first against the Indian Atheists by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) and later refined by <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (d. 235H) and then taken up by al-Baqillani (d. 403H) and the rest of the Ash'aris in general in their books.     <P>
And because this argument uses the presence of qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and actions (to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, hawaadith, meaning events, occurrences) to argue that they are bodies (ajsaam) that are "haadith", meaning to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, created (makhlooq), and therefore the universe is created - then when the Atheists said to them in return, "Fine, now described your Lord to us", the likes of Jahm and <u>the Jahmiyyah</u> had to deny everything for Allah in the revealed texts otherwise it would falsify their proof. So from those things were that Allaah never spoke to Moses (an event, occurrence that would mean Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, body) and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not Allaah's speech, that Allaah does not have speech and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is something created. So <u>the Mu'tazilah</u> took up the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and said that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, it was created in the Preserved Tablet or Jibreel, and likewise Allaah created His speech in the tree when He spoke to Moses, and that this can be said to be "Allaah's Speech" (Kalaamullaah), just like it is  said, "Baytullah", regarding the Ka'bah and "Rasoolullaah", regarding the Messenger, and "Naaqatullaah" regarding the She-camel and so on.     <P>
And then <u><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></u> came along and said that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, but it is not the speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of Allaah that is uncreated. That <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", and he was the first to innovate this saying and also the saying that the <u>Qur'an itself is "qadeem"</u>. So the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said the speech of Allaah which is uncreated is the singular, indivisible meaning that is present with His self from eternity, and as for the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have it is a quotation (hikaayah) of that meaning. So <u>Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari</u> used to sit in the circles of the Kullaabites and he heard this saying of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" and he adopted it, except that he said it is an expression (ibaarah) and not a quotation (hikaayah). And so this Kullaabi doctrine became the deen of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in this issue - and the origins of it all lie in the creed of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who were first to say that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, which is recited, memorized and heard is created - and this is saying of all of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - <u>except that those who became known as the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of the later times are the greatest in their deception in trying to cover up the reality of their saying</u> -  and that is the subject of another article. So their intent in all of this is to avoid falsifying their "intellectual proof" of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - and thus <u>they had to deny that Allaah has actions tied to His will, and as it relates to Allaah's speech, that Allaah speaks when He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills</u> - as this would mean, according to their metaphysical proof, that Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) subject to events (hawaadith).    <P>
<b><u>The Question</u></b>    <P>
Now dear Ash'ari, if you are still with us, then here is the question of our quiz:    <P>
<blockquote>Did Allaah speak untruthfully in those two verses? Meaning, that since Ash'aris believe that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is eternal (qadeem), it is from Allaah's eternal speech which is the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, are there things in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that amount to untruths? Because if the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> existed eternally with Allaah, yet Allaah says, "<b>Allaah has indeed heard the saying of those who said</b> ..." and "<b>Allaah has indeed heard the saying of she that disputes</b> ..." and neither she that disputes or those who said what they said existed from eternity alongside this speech which existed with Allaah's self and later expressed (according to the Ash'aris) in the words we now have with us in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is memorized, recited and heard, and as quoted in the two verses above. <b>In short, are their lies in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>?</b> Considering (upon the Ash'ari creed) that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an expression of a meaning present with Allaah's Self from eternity. What is the answer to this? And how can this matter be resolved? And what is the solution?</blockquote>    <P>
<b>The answer must come from an Ash'ari perspective. In other words what would be the response to this from the Ash'ari madhab and its textbooks?</b>    <P>

<b><u>Let's Increase the Stakes</u></b>    <P>
We haven't had any participation from budding Ash'ari Kalam Atomists and highly-powered Ash'ari defenders of the intellectual realm of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". So we are going to raise the stakes a little.    <P>
If we don't see any effort on behalf of the Ash'aris to defend their "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" in the form of responses with satisfactory answers to the above question, then the following presumption will be regarded as the standing truth, until it is rebutted:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Every Ash'ari who holds on to the doctrine of Kalam Nafsee (that Allaah's Speech is only the "singular meaning" that resides within Himself from eternity) is claiming, by necessity of this belief, that Allaah spoke lies and that there remains what amounts to lies in <u>the expression (ibaarah)</u> of the  <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, this "expression" being the "created" <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to the Ash'aris. And we seek refuge in Allaah from such an enormity, lofty and exalted is Allaah from what the oppressors presume, with a great and lofty exaltation.</b></blockquote>    <P>
This statement stands and <u>remains as truth</u> until a satisfactory answer is given to the quiz question above. <b>Hint:</b> Start looking for the cell phone numbers of your Kellers and Foudahs and the other big Jahmee guns.    <P>
<u>Saturday, 10 October 2009 17:21:00</u> No takers. Disappointed.    <P>
<b><u>Looks like we need to increase the stakes a bit more</u></b>    <P>
In addition to the two "lies" above (according to the doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" of the Kullaabi Ash'aris), lets increase the stakes more to see if we can get a response. So we say:    <P>
Hey look, here's another "pack of "lies" - according to the Ash'arite doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>":    <P>

<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> [Remember] When Moses said to his people, "Indeed Allaah command you to slaughter a cow..." </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Well, no Moses, no Jews, and no cow to slaughter in existence alongside the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> from eternity. And Allaah uses the particel "idh", along with a verb in the past tense "qaala" referring to Moses who said that Allaah "commands", so the command had obviously been communicated to ... yes  ... a non-existent Moses, who was conveying it to the non-existent Jews. So then the non-existent Jews kept asking questions, being pedantic, what type of [non-existent] cow and how old and what color and so on. So Allaah says that the [non-existent] Jews said to [the non-existent] Moses, in the past tense:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran' lang='AR-SA' align='right'><blockquote style='text-align:right;'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1575;&#1583;&#1618;&#1593;&#1615; &#1604;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1614;&#1603;&#1614; &#1610;&#1615;&#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1617;&#1616;&#1606; &#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1607;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> They said, "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!" (2:68) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And the [non-existent] Jews repeated this [non-existent] question three times, and [the non-existent] Moses responded three times with [what was from eternity the non-existent saying of a non-existent Moses]:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran' lang='AR-SA' align='right'><blockquote style='text-align:right;'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1610;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1604;&#1615; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> He (Moses) said: "He (Allaah) says..." </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So [upon the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Nafsee] no Moses, no Jews, no cow, the non-existent Moses had supplicated three times to Allaah and Allaah had responded three times to a non-existent Moses explaining the nature of the non-existent cow that ought to be slaughtered by the non-existent Jews. And Allaah said about the non-existent Moses, "qaala", meaning "He (the non-existent Moses) said..." - that's in the past tense, that "Innahu yaqoolu", referring to Allaah that "He (Allaah) is saying ...".     <P>
So to get this right, Allaah said in eternity in the past tense, that Moses had said (qaala, in the past tense) that Allaah is saying (yaqoolu in the present tense) regarding what the Jews had said (qaaloo) in the past tense ...    <P>
And after all of this to-ing and fro-ing in the past and present tense and between the non-existent Moses and the non-existent Jews, the Jews eventually did slaughter the non-existent cow:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran' lang='AR-SA' align='right'><blockquote style='text-align:right;'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1606;&#1614; &#1580;&#1616;&#1574;&#1618;&#1578;&#1614; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1614;&#1602;&#1617;&#1616; &#1601;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1615;&#1608;&#1607;&#1614;&#1575; &#1608;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1610;&#1614;&#1601;&#1618;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> They said (to Moses), "Now you have brought the truth." So <u>they slaughtered it</u> though they were near to not doing it. (Al-Baqarah 2:71) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So Allaah says in the past tense, "<u>fa dhabahoohaa</u>", that these non-existent Jews, slaughtered the non-existent cow, and the final part of the verse, "though they were near to not doing it" establishes that the act had certainly been completed - i.e. in eternity (upon the creed of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Nafsee) - with non-existent Jews and a non-existent cow.     <P>
<b>And this, O dear reader, is the type of fooling and playing around which is necessitated by the people of falsehood who speak with innovated sayings in belief that none of the Salaf ever spoke with - and we seek refuge in Allaah from what their sayings necessitate, and lofty and exalted is Allaah from all of that with a lofty exaltation!</b>    <P>
As for Ahl us-Sunnah, they say: Allaah has never ceased to be one who speaks (mutakallim) and further, He speaks when He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills, and this conforms to the clear and manifest evidences and indications in the Book and the Sunnah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>By the way, these verses from al-Baqarah are not like those verses regarding Allaah saying that <u>He heard she who disputed and heard the Jews who said what they said</u>. There is a  slight difference. But the intent here behind using this example is that the response the Ash'aris bring to this passage in al-Baqarah (and all similar passages) it would necessitate that they revert to and adopt the saying of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and one of their contemporaries (thanks al-Buti) reveals it very nicely (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see here</a>).</div>    <P>
  Dear Ash'ari,as you can see now, <u>the stakes are high</u>, so you need to get on that cell-phone quick, start sending out those broadcasts to your email lists, get onto the forums and blogs of all those highly-charged <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Atomists, and start finding an answer real soon ... and if saving the Ash'ari creed and defending the realm is not enough of an incentive, how about we throw in a free copy of Imaam Bukhaaree's "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad"?    <P>
<u>Sunday, 11 October 2009</u> No takers.    <P>
