<div class="articleContent">






<p>Let it be known that the earlier Ash'aris affirmed that Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence and they also affirmed some of the Attributes such as Allaah's Face, Hands, Eyes - in a manner that befits Him, without <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, or <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>. And this is because Abdullah bin Sa'eed bin Kullab (d. ~240H) who is the true author of what later became the creed of the earlier Ash'aris - had a strong inclination towards the hadeeth and aathar and he affirmed Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, as well as having many other affirmations in respect to Allaah's attributes.     <P>
Abu Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took the bulk of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> in the intermediate stage of his life (after his I'tizaal). And the other Ash'aris such as al-Baqillani, Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a> and others were subject to this influence and for this reason you find that they affirm Allaah beign above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence and affirming the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah such as Face, Hands and Eyes, without <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> or <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>See this section: <b>The Creed of the Early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> Differs From the Later (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> Series</b> - (<a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>here</a>)</div>    <P>
The later <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> starting from Imaam ul-Haramayn <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) onwards  simply reverted back to many of the views of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites, and they developed the Ash'ari madhhab towards a direction far away from what the earlier Ash'aris were upon, tending more towards the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites. And thus we see the likes of Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Raazee (d. 606H) becoming the chief orator, spokesman and champion of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> belief of negating there is a Lord above the heaven and a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
And as a further explanation of this:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background Notes</font>    <P>
Those affected by the creed of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) play games when faced with the issue of Allaah's existence external to the created universe, and some of them are led to make statements whose inherent contradictions they cannot see, such as affirming that "Allaah is above the Throne", but at the same time, "He is not in direction". When the strength of argument that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the Heaven, <u>with His Essence</u> dominates and subdues them, so they are forced to acknowledge it, but then go on to say "without direction", which in essence, implies non-existence, thus invalidating their saying "Allaah is above the Throne".     <P>
Their intent by negating "direction" is on account of what they have made to be the foundation of their creed, - the proof of the createdness of the universe through the presence of incidental attributes in bodies. And as location is an incidental attribute of created bodies, then in keeping with their intellectual proof, Allaah cannot be described with it, otherwise it would falsify the intellectual proof. Therefore, they are forced to deny Allaah being above the heaven (which to them is location and direction), along with many other attributes (the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'liyyah). This is why they express rejection of "direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>)" - its all about keeping their intellectual proof (of demonstrating the universe is created) from being invalidated.     <P>
<b>This is what the entire issue is about, from its beginning to its end.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>On a side note: The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> stood laughing and gobsmacked at the brazenness of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> when they also claimed "Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter" and then qualified it with "But not in any direction" - this being pure sophistry. They tried to flee from the creed of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this regard, but brought that which is impossible. So they affirmed the Ru'yah in one sentence to flee from its deniers, and then negated it in the other sentence fleeing, as they claimed, from <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Underlying Truth of the Entire Affair</font>    <P>
If you want to understand the deen of the Mu'attilah (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah) then the following gets right down to the crux of it all - what is below is directed towards the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> but it applies to all of them, because their spring and fountain is the same - they just differ with each other on how to handle the texts of the revelation that contradict their "rational proof".    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Important Key Issue:</b>    <P>
You should note here an extremely important point which is that when they say, "<i>Intellectual proof does not accept it</i>" in relation to what is apparent from the texts such as Him being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the heaven, or described with certain attributes, what they really mean by this statement is:    <P>
<blockquote> Allah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or Him being described with <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to His Will) flatly contradicts and invalidates our intellectual proof for the createdness of the universe. This proof allows us to establish a creator, and therefore the possibility and truthfulness of the prophethood and the possibility of resurrection - <u>and thus this intellectual proof is the basis of the entire religion, because without it we cannot affirm the veracity of revelation or of prophethood</u>.     <P>
And in light of that, Allaah being described with incidental attributes invalidates our proof, because we have argued against the atheists with this proof, by showing that bodies are not free of incidental attributes, and that this proves their createdness. For this reason, everything that has come in the revealed texts (of Allaah being described with attributes and actions) that falsifies our proof must be figuratively explained, if not denied altogether. And as the intellectual proof is decisive (qat'ee), then whatever is in the revelation that contradicts it, must be figuratively explained away, if not denied altogether, and thus we speak with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed - these being the routes through which we defend and protect our rational proof.    <P>
Thus, we can't describe Allaah with incidental attributes - such as loving, hating, anger, pleasure, and ascending (<a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>) and descending (<a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>) and so on - for the reason that those atheists will look at us and almost die of laughter - because of our use of a rational proof that in itself falsifies the existence of the very One whose existence we are trying to prove, because the nature of our proof is such that it necessitates the Creator (being described with attributes, actions and being above the heaven) is also a created body - and in that case we have no answer to the atheists.</blockquote>    <P>
It is for this reason that all their speech regarding Allaah is dominated by the terms "<b><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></b>" (body), "<b><a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a></b>" (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), "<b>arad</b>" (incidental attribute) "<b>tahayyuz</b>" (spatial occupation), "<b><a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a></b>" (direction), "<b>makaan</b>" (location) and so on. Since these are the terms they have made to be the basis of their demonstration of the createdness of the universe (because of bodies being space-occupying things that are not free of incidental attributes) - then they are forced to negate these terms for Allaah the Exalted, in order not to invalidate their proof. And whatever they find in the revealed texts of Allaah being described with attributes or actions that contradict their intellectual proof - it is subject to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (or the entirety of it is subject to tafweed).    <P>
<b>That is what is really going on</b> - and you need to be wise to this and understand truly where these people are coming from, even if they themselves do not understand where they are coming from - as is the case with the vast majority of the Ash'aris who are ignorant of what their creed is based upon, and who delve and dispute in these affairs.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Revisiting the Difference Between the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> and the Later Ones Regarding their Position on Allaah being Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (and Hence the Issue of Createdness)</font>    <P>
The Ash'aris claim that attributing direction to Allaah necessitates He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and therefore kufr (disbelief) and this argument of theirs returns back to what they made to be the foundation of their religion of the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - the createdness of the universe, and their notions of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) and body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), occupation of space (tahayyuz) and so on. So anything that is in a direction or that can be pointed to, must be occupying space, and anything that occupies space must, by their definition, be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> - therefore Allaah cannot be above the creation with His Essence.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>Take a look here</a></b>, and see how Abu Nicomachus <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, elucidates that anything in location, must be a body - and then ask yourself from where did these Ash'aris learn about their manner of speaking about Allaah?</div>    <P>
To them, the universe is made up of space-occupying indivisible particles (al-jawaahir al-fardah), and a body is whatever is composed of two or more of these indivisible particles - and all bodies have incidental attributes which included location and direction. Thus, location and direction necessitates <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (something being a body) - and since they made these foundations to be the basis for proving the createdness of the universe, and hence a creator, and since they made the truthfulness of the Messenger and the possibility of the resurrection to be dependent upon this proof - they had to maintain its sanctity and therefore denied everything in the texts that would contradict and nullify this proof, and hence they denied Allaah is above the heaven, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.     <P>
And it is because of this that they say, "<i>Affirming direction for Allaah is kufr</i>" which translates as:    <P>
<ul><li>Affirming direction for Allaah necessitates He is in a location  <li> And if He is in a location, it necessitates He is occupying space  <li> <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>And if He is occupying space</a>, He must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) - <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>thanks</a> <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>...  <li> And if He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), then He must be created  <li> And thus, this invalidates our proof for the createdness of the universe, and we cannot prove the existence of a Creator  <li> And this makes it impossible to argue for the possibility of prophethood and the possibility of resurrection  <li> And since we cannot now rationally prove any of that to the atheists, it follows that affirming direction for Allaah is kufr (because it negates all those things which are the very foundations of our religion - the createdness of the universe, the existence of a Creator, the possibility of prophethood and the possibility of ressurection)  </ul>    <P>
In short, this is the equation:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the heaven = Kufr in the existence of a Creator, kufr in the prophethood and kufr in the resurrection.</b></div>    <P>
Now, the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, as we have pointed, out held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>with His Essence</u> and is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) - and even though they elaborated upon the same proof (for the createdness of the universe) - they could not deny Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, because of the strength of evidence and because it was known to be the deen of the Muslims, despite the emergence of the sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who were at that time scorned, debased, disgraced and humiliated. So they (the early Ash'aris) said, "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>and is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</u></i>". It was well established and was irrefutable and was manifestly known that the belief of all the Muslims (save the Jahmites) was that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the heaven. So the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> had to accept it, but they added their innovated term of negation "<i>but he is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</i>" - as a disclaimer and as a means to protect their intellectual proof.     <P>
This also shows that to the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, does not necessitate Allaah being a body. The <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> however, they negated Allaah being above the heaven unrestrictedly and absolutely, and they argued that Allaah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates that He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) - and one of the chief spokesman of this is <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) who unscrupulously utilized many of the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (who are supposed to be his disputants) in the process.    <P>
All of the above is the manifest truth and can be amply demonstrated (from their own books), and it will be demonstrated inshaa'Allaah through the content that will be added to this website in the future by Allaah's permission.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Way of the Salaf Towards the Deniers of Allaah Being Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, Above the Heaven</font>    <P>
Let us look at how the Salaf were wise to the likes of al-Jahm bin Safwaan (ex. 128H) and his associates and Bishr al-Mareesee (d. 218H) and his associates and how they held and treated them - noting that this is what all of today's (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris are upon. It would be a good idea <a href=index7863.html?upfkv>to read this article</a> to understand why al-Jahm bin Safwaan decided to become the flag bearer of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> in the Ummah.    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>" (3/522-526):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-522-526.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When that is known, then the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> openly proclaimed the issue of the Qur'aan, that it is created, and they openly proclaimed that Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter, but they did not proclaim to the generality of the believers and their scholars [their] rejection that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that He is "neither within the universe nor outside of it". But the Scholars used to know this about them through inference and insight (through scrutiny) - just as the Hypocrites were known from their tone of speech. Allaah, the Most High said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks, but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!

So Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, swore the Hypocrites are known by their tone of speech.    <P>
And this is just like what Hammaad bin Zayd (d.179H) said, the Imaam who was from the greatest of the Scholars of the religion ...</blockquote>    <P>
Then he quotes the saying of Hammaad, which is reported by al-Bukhaaree in "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" of al-Bukhaaree (p.31) and by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", and also by Ibn al-Qayyim in "Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah" (2/214):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Qur'aan is the Speech of Allaah, Jibreel descended with it. They (the Jahmites) are not attempting except to (say) that there is no deity above the heaven.</blockquote>    <P>
Then he quotes the saying of Hammaad bin Zayd (d.179H) also which is reported by Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 41) and by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", and also by <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p. 146)    <P>

And then what has been said by 'Abbaad bin al-Awwaam al-Waasitiyy (d. 185H), as has been reported by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> in <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.88), Ibn al-Qayyim in "Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah) (2/216) and Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 65):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I spoke to Bishr al-Mareesee and his associates, and I saw that the final (part) of their speech ends up with them saying there is nothing above the heaven.</blockquote>    <P>
And then he quotes what has been said by Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee  (d. 198H) as narrated by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", and Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 147), and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> also referenced it to "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" of Ibn Abee Haatim:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is not amongst the people of desires [those] more evil than the companions of Jahm [bin Safwan]. They are revolving around [the issue] of wanting to say that there is nothing above the heaven. I consider, by Allaah, that they are not to be married into, and nor should inheritance (be given to them or taken from them).</blockquote>    <P>
And he quotes again from Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee (d. 198H), referencing this to "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" of Ibn Abee Haatim:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The companions of Jahm wish to say that there is nothing above the heaven, and that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. I consider that their repentance is sought, so either they repent or they are killed.</blockquote>    <P>
And he quotes from 'Aasim bin 'Alee and which has been reported by Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 191):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I debated a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, and it became clear that he does not believe that there is a Lord above the Heaven.</blockquote>    <P>
And also from 'Alee bin Aasim, and which has been reported by al-Bukhaaree in "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" (p. 32):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Those who are say "Indeed Allaah has a son" are not greater (disbelievers) than those who say "Allaah does not speak".</blockquote>    <P>
And he quotes from him ('Alee bin 'Aaasim) again, as narrated by al-Bukhaaree in "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" (p. 32) and Ijtimaa Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah of Ibn al-Qayyim (2/216):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Beware of al-Mareesee and his companions, for indeed their speech is the starting point of heresy, and I spoke to their teacher, Jahm, and he did not affirm that there was a deity above the Heaven.</blockquote>    <P>
And 'Alee bin 'Aasim is the father of 'Aasim, who is Abul Hasan 'Aasim bin 'Alee bin 'Aasim bin Suhayb al-Waasitee.    <P>
After this, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And this is how I found this from him in the book "Khalq Af'aal il-'Ibaad" of al-Bukhaaree, and the first (narration) was narrated by Ibn Abee Haatim from 'Aaasim bin 'Alee bin 'Aasim in the book "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah"...</blockquote>    <P>
Then after a few pages <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And much of the likes of this is (found) in the speech of the Salaf and the leading Scholars. They used to refute what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> manifested of negating the Ru'yah [seeing Allaah in the Hereafter], and [speaking with] the creation of the Qur'aan, and they used to mention what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> used to concceal from what was even greater than that, that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and they (the Salaf) would make this to be the eventual outcome of their saying, that being a negation of the Maker, and rejection of the Creator. Since they (the Jahmites) did not used to openly proclaim this amongst the Believers, just like they used to openly proclaim the issue of the Speech (of Allaah) and the Ru'yah. This is because [Allaah being above the Throne] was firmly established in the hearts of the Muslims on account of the necessary innate fitrah (instinctive knowledge) upon which they were created, and on account of what had come to them from the Messengers of clear proofs and guidance, and on account of what the people of faith had agreed upon regarding that - and towards which the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were not able to manifest any opposition:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger  after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. (An-Nisa 4:115) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So this explains that acknowledging that Allaah is above the universe through both the intellect and the religion, is greater by a great deal than acknowledging that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter and that the Qur'aan is not created.    <P>
And when the likes of this gang (of people) in whom there is Tajahhum (i.e. the doctrines of al-Jahm bin Safwaan) whatever there is, such as ar-Raazee and his likes, affirm that Allaah will be seen (in the Hereafter), then for them to affirm that Allaah is above the universe is more befitting and appropriate. For verily, there is no question posed about the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (Allaah's aboveness) except that what is even greater than it can be posed about the issue of ar-Ru'yah.</blockquote>   <P>
