<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanation of The Chestnut Tree</font>    <P>
Inshaa'Allaah if you have been following all the various articles on the site, the above illustration should be fairly clear. Much of what is explained below is found in many other articles on this site. Here, we want to bring it together, using the above illustration as a framework and we want to:    <P>
<ul><li> Mention something about each of the factions  <li> Give a commentary on the above illustration through the two examples of the creed of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that a) the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> not being the uncreated Speech of Allaah and b) Allaah not beeing seen in the Hereafter.</ul>    <P>
<b><u>Jahm bin Safwan (ex. 128H) and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - The Roots (Beginnings)</u></b>    <P>
Jahm bin Safwan debated the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> (Indian Atheist Philosophers) who were Materialists and also believed in the transmigration of souls (that souls move from one being to another). In many areas where Islam had spread there were found people who were upon and were conversant with the Philosophy of the Greeks and of Aristotle's <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> in particular (<a href=indexab1a.html?iowfm>learn more about that here</a>). Jahm tried to prove a creator by demonstrating the createdness of the universe through the presence of qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith) in bodies (ajsaam). When they said "You can't perceive your Lord, so how can he exist", and "Describe your Lord to us", he got confused, and abandoned the prayer for forty days because he did not know who or what he was worshiping. He then, devised an answer to the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> which was that just like your souls occupy your bodies without you perceiving them with any of the senses, then Allaah is likewise, He is in everything and everywhere but without being perceived by the senses, and nor is He described with anything.    <P>
The answer of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> contained the following foundations:    <P>
<ul><li> Allah is in every place and in everything  <li> But at the same time not perceived by the senses  <li>And not described with anything that the creation is described with (the innovation of ta'teel)  <li>Making the intellect decisive over the revealed texts, on the basis that his intellectual proof is the ultimate truth around which all else revolves  <li> Explaining away the revealed texts (the innovation of ta'weel) to prevent them clashing with the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"  </ul>    <P>
And this innovation of Jahm gave birth to <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> and <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a> on the one hand (Allaah indwelling within His creation) and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> on the other (negating Allaah Names, Attributes and Actions from Allaah) - as well as the innovation of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (figurative interpretation) in regards to <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> and Attributes, and considering the intellectual proof to be decisive over the revealed texts.    <P>
As a result of this Jahm was forced to take the following positions (amongst others):    <P>
<ul><li><u>That Allaah did not speak to Moses</u> - because it would mean an event (haadithah) in Allaah's Essence, and thus making Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying his (Jahm's) proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah did not take Ibraaheem (alayhis salaam) as his Khaleel</u>, because "khullah" (friendship) is an incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), and an occurrence (haadith) - since Ibraaheem has not existed eternally, so if Allaah took Ibraaheem as a Khaleel (an-Nisaa 4:125) it would mean Allah is subject to <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and occurrences, events (hawaadith) which are the properties of bodies (ajsaam), and thus it would mean Allaah is created, like all other bodies (ajsaam). Therefore they rejected that Allaah indeed took Ibraaheem as His Khaleel.    <P>
<li> <u>That the Qur'aan is created</u> - because if Allaah spoke it, it would consist of many instances of individual speech and all of these would be occurrences (hawaadith) or incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), thus rendering Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying his proof. So the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not Allaah's speech its the created speech of Jibreel (alayhis salaam) or the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter</u> - because if He could be seen, it would be in a direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>), as things are only see in direction, and this would make Him a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus falsifying his proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah is not above the heaven</u> - because this would necessitate direction, and anything in direction must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus Allaah would be a body, and thus the proof would be falsified - and Jahm took this from al-Ja'd bin Dirham (ex. 124H).    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah cannot be described with anything that the creation is described with</u> - because all descriptions that we see are only found in bodies (ajsaam), thus Allaah cannot be described with anything, otherwise it would necessitate that He is a body. He made an exception for certain names that would be unique to Allaah, such as "al-Khaaliq (the Creator)" and "al-Qaadir (the Powerful)" and as a result of this:    <P>
<li> <u>That the servants actions are forced (al-jabr)</u> - which is that since <u>only</u> Allaah has power (qudrah) and creates (khalq), then it means the servants actions must be forced upon them, so he denied iraadah (will) and qudrah (ability) for the servants and thus spoke with the bid'ah of al-jabr - and this branched off from his <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the Names and Attributes.</ul>    <P>
So these are the <b><u>roots</u></b> of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and they are base and foundation for all the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> in the Ummah thereafter. In addition to this <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> was also the student of al-Ja'd bin Dirham (ex. 124H) and al-Ja'd took the sayings of the pseudo-Sabean Harranian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, who spoke of the Creator only through negative affirmations, such as "<i>He is not oppressive, He is not blind, He is not deaf, He does not die</i> ..." and these are called "sifaat salbiyyah" (attributes of negation). So Jahm's speech about the creator began to take on a certain form and this has been document in the early books of aqeedah. And <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> originated many ta'weels (figurative explanations) for the revealed texts that contradicted his "intellectual proof", and these were transmitted through the Ummah, and later <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> such as Bishr al-Mareesee (d. 218H) also had their fair share of ta'weels which were taken up by the later factions. All these ta'weels originated in order to deal with those problematic texts in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah that contradicted or invalidated this intellectual proof.    <P>
<b><u>The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - The Trunk (Consolidation)</u></b>     <P>
From the chiefs of the early <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are the likes of Amr bin Ubayd (d. 144H), and they took much of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and concurred with them, and they made this "intellectual proof" of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" to be ultimate truth upon which the entire religion is based upon, following the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in that. So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> refined this proof and they elaborated upon it and incorporated the theory of the Greek Philosopher <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (d. 370BC) of "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" into it, and they did much to consolidate this proof. This work of consolidation is what constitutes the <b><u>trunk</u></b> in our chestnut tree above.    <P>
When they saw that Allaah clearly affirms Names for Himself, they disagreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, because this would appear clearly as rejection of clear texts of the Qur'aan. So they found a way to reconcile between affirming Names for Allaah and keeping the intellectual proof intact and free of criticism and invalidation.     <P>
So they affirmed <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, but only as mere labels all of which are synonymous with "Allaah" and none of which represent independent meanings or attributes because this would falsify the proof and necessitate <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) within Allaah's Essence, thereby making Him a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body). Thus Allaah is "ar-Raheem (the Merciful)" but without "rahmah (mercy)", and He is ", "as-Samee' (the All-Hearing)", but without "sam' (hearing)" and so on. And all these Names (ar-Raheem, as-Samee' and so on) are simply labels that refer back to "Allaah".    <P>
Therefore, they affirmed the Names (outwardly, on the surface) but rejected all the other attributes, including the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah (attributes Allaah is always described with) and <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (attributes, or actions tied to Allaahs will and which He is not permanently described with).    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> also took up the issues spoken of by Jahm, such as the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created and they put the Ummah to trial by way of them. This is because if the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was Allaah's Speech, it meant Allaah was subject to occurrences (hawaadith), meaning things occurring in Allaah's Essence after not having occurred - in this case multiple instances of speech - and this to them is proof of something being a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) so they considered the saying that the Qur'aan is Allaah's Speech to be kufr, and this is why those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who debated with <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, they charged him with kufr and shirk. Likewise, if Allaah had spoken to Moses direct, and if Allaah had said that He heard the saying of the woman who disputed (the mujaadilah), then this would mean Allaah is subject to occurrences (hawaadith), because Allaah would have spoken these things after the ceation of Moosaa and after the creation of the women who disputed, so this would mean a change has occurred in Allah, and thus, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we recite and memorize cannot be Allaah's speech, it must be created speech, either Jibreel's or Muhammad's and thus they fought for the saying that "the Qur'aan is created", because they considered this saying to be Tawheed.    <P>
Likewise, regarding the issue of seeing Allaah in the Hereafter, they rejected it because being seen means something must be in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>), and direction necessitates place (makaan), and place necessitates <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (something being a body), and so they had to reject that too. And on this basis, we can understand many of the other rejections of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - they all followed the same course, being nourished by the roots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>Ibn Kullaab and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> - The Branches (Reaching Out)</u></b>    <P>
Then came <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was the Imaam of the Sifaatiyyah amongst the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, and "Sifaatiyyah" refers to those who affirmed something of the Attributes as opposed to nothing (i.e. unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Mu'tazilah). However, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was essentially trying to tread a middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the People of the Sunnah and he was the originator of many of the views of the Ash'aris. These views are best characterized as <u>attempts to flee from the views of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but not quite reaching the Sunnah</u>, that's if we are being very generous.  Outwardly these sayings appeared to agree with the Sunnah, whereas in reality, and in truth, they were nothing but the actual sayings of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, clothed with layers of rationalities and sophistries.    <P>
Now <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> affirmed the seven attributes (life, power, will, knowledge, speech, hearing, seeing) and he managed to justify why these are necessitated by the intellect but do not falsify the intellectual proof. In addition he also affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah such as Face, Hands, Eyes, without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or tafweed. However, he denied the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (attributes or actions tied to Allaah's will). And this creed is what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took from the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and it then became known with the label of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" (see further below).    <P>
So from the matters spoken of by <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was that "the Qur'aan is Allaah's speech and it is not created". Now, this appears to agree completely with Ahl us-Sunnah. <u>But it's not</u>. You see <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> spoke of Allaah's speech as being "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", which is that Allaah's speech is really just "a meaning" that has been with Allaah from eternity, and that the Qur'aan, being from Allaah's speech, is from that "kalaam  nafsee" - as is the Torah, Injeel and the Zabur,and that this "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" is single and indivisible. So when he says, "The Qur'aan is the speech of Allaah, not created", he is <u>not</u> talking about the written, memorized, recited Qur'aan that we have between two covers, and which we believe Allaah spoke and Jibreel heard, and which Jibreel spoke and Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) heard. Rather, he means by the Qur'aan what is part of Allaah's overall speech and which collectively amounts to a "meaning" that has eternally been with Allaah's Self. This is what they actually mean. And the Ash'aris took up this view of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" and defended it, because it was a way to reconcile between two things, to affirm the Qur'aan being "the speech of Allaah, uncreated" (outwardly), but at the same time, not invalidating that intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>".    <P>
So the views of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> are the <b><u>branches</u></b> that come from the trunk and which are attempting to reach out to the Sunnah, but not really getting there.    <P>
Another example is that of the attributes of "pleasure (<a href='tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>)" and "anger (<a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a>)". <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> tried to do the same with these attributes which to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> are incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), which means Allaah is not always described with them, and thus if Allaah is described with something after not being described with it, it is an event, an occurrence (haadithah) and only bodies (ajsaam) are subject to events. Thus, these types of attributes had to be dealt with.    <P>
And so Ibn Kullaab's saying was, as documented by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> in  "Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen":    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...that the attributes are established with Allaah, and that Allaah has never ceased to be pleased with one whom He knows will die as a believer, and [never ceased being] angry upon the one whom He knows will die as a disbeliever, and similarly is his saying, regarding al-walaayah (allegiance), and al-adaawah (enmity, disownment), and al-mahabbah (love)</blockquote>    <P>
And what this saying means is that Allaah is pleased, from eternity, with whomever He knew, with His eternal knowledge, would die as a believer. And that He is angry, from eternity, with whomever he knew, with His eternal knowledge, would die as a disbeliever. And thereafter, they make <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> and anger to be synonymous with Allaah's will (iraadah). And this is a vile and corrupt saying and we have dedicated an entire article to it (<a href=indexd41e.html?kcxwt>you can view that here</a>) - but the point being here, is that <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was an Imaam of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> who affirmed the Attributes and he devised sayings in which he tried to flee from the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and to adopt positions that outwardly appeared to be in agreement with the Sunnah. So you would think from the above saying that <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> affirms <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> and anger, but far from it.    <P>
So again <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, their views are <b><u>branches</u></b> that come off the trunk since their views are mere extensions of the views of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and they tried to tread a middle ground and reach out to the Sunnah in these issues.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>One point that must be clarified is that on the issue of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (Allaah being above the Throne), <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was a staunch proponent of this, and he refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> quite powerfully and strongly, as we have documented in other articles. <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> held Allaah to above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but he added to this, "but not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)" - and this saying was inherited by the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>. You need to go to the diagram further below, the willow tree, where we deal with this issue specifically. </div>    <P>
So in summary, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> although affirming some attributes, he had to explain away others which are the attributes tied to Allaah's will ("<a href="tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>" or "af'aal iktiyaariyyah") - because these attributes contradict and conflict completely, with the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and there is absolutely no way to reconcile them with the proof and thus, they must be subject to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>The Ash'aris - The Twigs and Leaves (Embellishment and Adornment)</u></b>    <P>
When speaking about the Ash'aris, it is important for us to understand that the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> inherited the view of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> on the subject of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and some of the sifat dhaatiyyah such as Face, Hands and Eyes. So you will see the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, adding to this statements such as "without contact" and "without confinement" and the likes and they refuted the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in this regard. Likewise, with respect to Face, Hands and Eyes, they affirmed these attributes as attributes of the dhaat (Essence) without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and they refuted the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.The <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) reverted back to the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on those issues because they felt these matters could not be reconciled with the intellectual proof. So we should keep this difference in mind between the earlier and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>.     <P>
The Ash'aris then took the bulk of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H), and they authored in refutation of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the issues in which they differed with them. And note that the refutations between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are refutations to do with subsidiary issues after they have agreed upon the usool (foundations). The foundational principles of the Ash'aris are in fact the foundational principles of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. <b>The Ash'aris simply refuted the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the issue of what can and cannot be denied from Allaah in light of whether it will invalidate the intellectual proof or not</b>.     <P>
<b>This is the real nature of the dispute between them and in fact between all of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (practitioners of ilm ul-kalaam, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah).</b>    <P>
And the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> affirmed the seven attributes, not because they are in the revealed texts, but because the intellect proves them. So they rationally prove the attributes of life, knowledge, will and power (and to them, the revelation only provides confirmation, tawkeed, of these attributes) and these attributes form the basis for speaking with the miracles occurring to the Prophets, which then establishes the truthfulness of the Prophets and establishes the rational argument in favor of revelation. So what the Ash'aris did is that they developed the intellectual proof further and refined it and developed a theology around it and having inherited the legacy of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> in all of that. They have differences with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding some of the intricacies of the rational proof, but all of that is really a subsidiary difference.    <P>
If you look at the positions of the Ash'aris you can see they are in the same vain as those of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>.    <P>
<ul><li> They hold the speech of Allaah is "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" inclusive of the Qur'aan, and in reality their saying is that the Qur'aan we have in between the two covers, which is recited and memorized - that it is created, and what they refer to as the "uncreated Qur'an" is simply the meaning that exists with Allaah's Self from eternity. So in truth, the recited and memorized Qur'aan we have with us is created in their view. This is the reality of their saying, which is the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<li>Likewise, the saying found amongst them that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter, "but not in a direction", this is sophistry, they are trying to affirm the Ru'yah (to oppose the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and to avoid rebuke), but then to avoid invalidating their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" in which they are in agreement with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they say, "but not in a direction", and some of them say "it's a seeing of the heart, not of the eyes".</ul>    <P>
This is the generality of what you find in the Ash'arite creed, all we are seeing is <b><u>twigs</u></b> and <b><u>leaves</u></b>, they are following <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and they are simply trying to tread the middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the people of the Sunnah, and the twigs and leaves are simply the cover and the embellishment - their sayings outwardly appear to be in agreement with the Sunnah but in reality are simply the actual sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, so the <b><u>leaves</u></b> conceal all that.     <P>
And so the bulk of the Ash'arite polemic and that which is of most concern in their madhhab in terms of speech and authorship is  how to rationally defend the intellectual proof, to develop it, to refine it and to hunt for ta'weels to deal with problematic texts in the Book and the Sunnah, or to devise new ones - and all of this is the "ilm ul-kalaam" that they are upon and which the Salaf condemned.    <P>
As we have mentioned early, the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is something that does not fit in the Chestnut Tree above, so we have a separate tree for that, its the Willow tree:      <P>
<img src=assets/images/willow-tree-2.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanation of The Willow Tree</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> spoke with the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> on this issue and it was not possible for them to deny something that was so firmly established and known from the likes of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, Abu Haneefah, Imaam Malik, Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee and the Imaams of the Salaf that preceded them. And <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> had powerful refutations of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this regard. So the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> affirmed it but added their own qualifications such as "without contact" and "without confinement" in order to avoid invalidating their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", and in this they followed the view of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, but is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>).    <P>
So far so good, we are at the Chestnut Tree still. We are at the <b><u>branches, twigs and leaves</u></b> (i.e. the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and Early As'ariyyah) - which means (if you recall from the discussion above) that you affirm "Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence", but then add "but not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)", so this way you are combining between the Sunnah and at the same time, avoiding the invalidation of the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" (taken from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Jahmiyyah) - so you are trying to combine between the two and this is the Kullaabi manhaj and this is what essentially constitutes the Ash'ari madhhab - so at this point we are at the <b><u>branches, twigs and leaves</u></b>. The <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> came along and they maintained this position and they embellished it with their own statements:    <P>
<ul><li>without mumaassah (touch, contact),   <li>without spatial occupation (tahayyuz),   <li>without confinement, limitation (tahdeed)   <li>without adjacency  <li>and so on ... </ul>    <P>
Because they were forced to make these embellishments in order to negate <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (something being a body) - <u>whilst affirming</u> that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence.    <P>
But then along came <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606) - the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> - and they considered this to be a problem - you can't claim Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>and</u> not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that is a contradiction because something said to be "above" is direction and direction necessitates place and place necessitates <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> - and the proof of the intellect is decisive and definitive over the text, so the intellect has got to be correct and the text has to be interpreted -  and so they went back into the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and so they started saying, "Allaah is not inside the universe, nor outside the universe" which is a saying that is derived from the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that Allaah is in every place - and we will cover this in a separate article insha'Allaah.    <P>
We come, therefore, to our willow tree, which means that those smaller branches, twigs and leaves simply drop back down towards the trunk and the roots in the ground - meaning back in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. And this is what happened with the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> on the subject of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and some of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Dhaatiyyah. So in order to defend the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> reverted to the viewpoints of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on the issue of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and some of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah and this is why you find them using the same ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> for which you find refutations in the books of the early Ash'aris!!    <P>
See for example, al-Baqillani, refuting the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Dhaatiyyah <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>in this article</a>. And Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> refuting other ta'weels <a href=indexee1d.html?gcctb>in this article</a>. And <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself refuting the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> <a href=index0a89.html?cljbd>in this article</a> - and you can read more on this <a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>in this section here</a>.    <P>
