<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Who is <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>?</font>    <P>
He is Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Sa'eed bin Muhammad bin Kullaab al-Qattan al-Basri. He was one of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (speculative theologians) during the time of al-Ma'moon, and he had debates and works against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and the "<a href="tags/kullaabiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kullaabiyyah</font></a>" are ascribed to him. He has a number of works that are documented such as "Kitaab as-Sifaat", "Khalq Af'aal" and "ar-Radd 'ala al-Mu'tazilah". These books are lost, however remnants of them can be found in other works such as al-Maqaalaat of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, and also in the works of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim, and he is also quoted by the early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> such as <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H), and some of them, such as "Kitaab us-Sifaat" are mentioned by Ibn an-Nadim (d. 385H) in his "Fihrist" (Catalogue), who referred to him as a "From amongst the Hashawiyyah", and <a href='tags/ibn-hajr-al-asqalani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani</font></a> explained this statement in "Lisaan ul-Meezaan" to mean that he (<a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>) was upon the way of the Salaf in leaving the ta'weelaat (figurative explanations) of the verses and hadeeths related to the Attributes (which Ibn Hajar wrongly identifies as tafweed, rather the way of the Salaf is <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of the ma'naa and consigning knowledge of the reality to Allaah, and negating any likeness). <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> died around or after 240H.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Kullaab and the <a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
Ibn Kullab is the true and real author of what became known as the creed of the earlier Ash'aris, and Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> adopted the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> as <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> had much in the way of refutation of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - whom <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> had abandoned. <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> tended towards the Hadeeth and the Sunnah and had good positions, however he tried to tread a middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the people of the Sunnah and this explains elements of his creed such as adopting the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah (attributes of the essence) for Allaah but negating the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (attributes of action), and inventing the idea of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (the eternal speech in the self of Allaah) in order to flee from the saying that the speech of Allaah is created - amongst many other views, and this is a subject on its own so it can be left for another article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
The point here is that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> adopted the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and likewise <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> took the Sunnah viewpoints from Zakariyyaa as-Saajee (d. 307H), and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and as-Saajee were both from Basrah. The Kullaabi influence is what led to what became broadly recognized as the Ash'ari creed which is essentially <b>a blend of Mu'tazili foundational principles (forming the trunk) but with the branches trying to reach out towards the Sunnah but not quite getting there</b>. The influences of Zakariyyaa as-Saajee led <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> to become close to the truth on many issues - which he adopted at the end of his life.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The Ash'ari usool (Foundational Principles) are in fact the Mu'tazili usool - and this will be proven in a separate series of articles with direct quotes from both the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. Their underlying usool are the same, they only differ on subsidiary issues - and when they make a display and boast of having refuted the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and being the "champions" of Islaam, then <u>their refutations of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are mostly on subsidiary issues after their agreement on the same underlying (false) foundational principles</u>. And this is what is kept hidden from most average Ash'aris.</div>    <P>
Ibn Kullaab was held in high esteem by the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, and we will see inshaa'Allaah in a later article speech from <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> demonstrating the lofty status of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> as it relates to what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> acquired from him of affairs of the religion - and for this reason, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was rightly labelled as "the Imaam of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> that Affirm the Attributes", which means the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. In reality, the early Ash'arite creed was essentially, the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his followers.    <P>
In this article we want to document the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in general, inclusive of his view regarding Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, from al-Ash'ari's book "Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen".     <P>
One should note that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> wrote a series of books towards the end of his life which progressively got better and more closer to the Sunnah has he became more acquainted with the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah. However, in the process of writing some of these books, his knowledge of the Sunnah was not detailed, only general, whilst his knowledge of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> was detailed, and thus, in these books, which includes "Maqaalaat ul-Islaamiyyeen", there are things that are found that are not in accordance with the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah, and he represents certain views as being those of Ahl us-Sunnah which are in fact not, and which he himself in his later book "al-Ibaanah" no longer affirmed or spoke with. So this is something to be aware of regarding the books of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, the best of which is his last authorship, "al-Ibaanah 'an Usool id-Diyaanah".    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> on the Creed of <a href="tags/ibn-kullaab.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Kullaab</font></a></font>    <P>
Here is the cover to the book, this is the first edition of a 1950 Egyptian (Cairo) print.:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/maqaalaat-ashari-cover.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is one section dealing with the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his associates (1/325):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/maqaalaat-ashari-ibn-kullaab-a.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And the translation of which is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>A Mention of the Saying of the Companions of Abdullaah bin Sa'eed [Ibn Kullaab] al-Qattaan</b>    <P>
As for the companions of Abdullaah bin Sa'eed al-Qattaan, then they speak with most of what we have mentioned from Ahl us-Sunnah, and they affirm that the Creator, the Exalted, has never ceased to be aalim (knowning), qaadir (able), samee' (hearing), baseer (seeing), azeez (all-powerful, might), adheem (mighty), jaleel (lofty, majestic), kabeer (great), kareem (generous, kind), mureed (willing), mutakallim (speaking), jawaad (generous).    <P>
And they affirm ilm (knowledge), qudrah (power), hayaat (life), sam' (hearing), basr (seeing), adhmah (might, grandeur), jalaal (majesty), kibriyaa (pride), iraadah (will), <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) as attributes for Allaah, the Sublime.    <P>
And they say: It is not said about the Names of Allaah - the Sublime - and His Attributes that they are other than Him. And it is not said, "His knowledge is other than Him" as is said by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. And it is not said, "His knowledge is Him" as is said by some of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. And likewise is their saying for all of their attributes, they do not say: knowledge (ilm) is power (qudrah), and they do not say: Other than power (qudrah).    <P>
And they claim that the Attributes are established with Allaah, and that Allaah has never ceased to be pleased with one whom He knows will die as a believer, and [never ceased being] angry upon the one whom He knows will die as a disbeliever, and similarly is his saying, regarding al-walaayah (allegiance), and al-adaawah (enmity, disownment), and al-mahabbah (love).    <P>
And he [Ibn Kullaab) used to claim that the Qur'aan is the speech of Allaah, not created, and his saying on al-Qadar is as we have quoted from Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Hadeeth, and likewise his saying on the [outcome] of the people of major sin, and likewise his saying on the ru'yah (seeing) of Allaah - the Sublime - with the vision (of the eyes).     <P>
And he [Ibn Kullaab] used to claim that the Creator never ceased to exist, whilst there was no place and time before the creation, and that He is (now) what He has never ceased to be upon, and that He is ascended above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, as He said, and that He is above everything.</blockquote>    <P>
A number points here from what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> has quoted regarding <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his companions:    <P>
<b><u>Regarding the Names</u></b>    <P>
Ibn Kullaab affirms the Names (in opposition to the Jahmites) and he affirms that the Names comprise attributes (in opposition to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who affirmed the Names on the surface only but not in reality).    <P>
<b><u>Regarding the Attributes</u></b>    <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his followers avoided the methods used by the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to deny attributes from Allaah by saying that the Attributes are  Him (i.e. synonymous with the Essence) or other than Him (meaning something separate from Him, created, from within the creation, meaning His Attributes are merely a reference to created entities and not actually His attributes) - and these were methods used to deny that Allaah is described with Attributes.    <P>
<b><u>Regarding <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> and Anger</u></b>    <P>
This is where we need to be a bit sharp. <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his followers affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah (attributes of the Essence) but they did not affirm the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will) because in their view it necessitate Allaah was subject to occurrences (hawaadith) and change (taghayyur) - and the  Ash'ari creed is an extension of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and thus, they hold the same. And all of this is due to what they made to be the foundation of their religion, the rational proof for the demonstration of the createdness of the universe, through the presence of incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (haawaadith) in bodies (ajsaam). Thus, they had to deny the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, otherwise it would falsify their proof, or looked at another way, their proof would necessitate that Allaah is created because He is described with <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>.    <P>
Thus, they invented explanations to make the texts fit with their intellectual proof. And from those affairs was that they said that <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> with a believer about whom He knows will die as a believer, existed eternally with His Self. In other words, Allaah does not become pleased after not having been pleased, and Allaah does not become angry after not having been angry - meaning Allaah cannot be subject to occurrences, meaning something existing after not having existed - because this to them is <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> (something newly arising, not existing before). So their explanation is that <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> and anger and so on existed with Him eternally.    <P>
So when we read what has been said by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> regarding <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and his views, we need to be careful as to what is actually being said, because it may seem as if <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> is affirming these attributes, whereas in reality, he is interpreting these attributes in a manner that renders them non-existent.    <P>
And this view is a repugnant vile view, because it means that a person who remained most of his life as a believer, and then died as a disbeliever, then during the time that he was a believer, Allaah never ceased being angry with him from eternity, even though he worshipped Allaah alone whilst he was a believer. And vice versa, when a person remained a disbeliever most of his life, and then became a believer, Allaah never ceased to be pleased with him eternally, even whilst he was upon disbelief, worshiping idols or worshiping the cross. So we need to be careful and understand what we are reading here.     <P>
When <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> quotes the saying of the Kullaabiyyah:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they claim that the Attributes are established with Allaah, and that Allaah has never ceased to be pleased with one whom He knows will die as a believer, and [never ceased being] angry upon the one whom He knows will die as a disbeliever, and similarly is his saying, regarding al-walaayah (allegiance), and al-adaawah (enmity, disownment), and al-mahabbah (love).</blockquote>    <P>
Then we need to pay attention to this matter and not be deceived. And this saying is vile corrupt saying, we should realize that on account of trying to maintain the sanctity of their rational proof for demonstrating the createdness of the universe and therefore a creator - [and it is a false, corrupt proof which actually demonstrates the non-existence of a creator] - the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the speculative <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) were forced to devise certain views in many areas of creed <u>to avoid falsifying their proof</u> - and this is one particular example - and in trying to do so they propounded some vile, evil, corrupt  sayings.    <P>
<b><u>Regarding the Qur'aan</u></b>    <P>
What we have said above regarding the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> can be said also about the issue of Allaah's speech and the Qur'aan. Because <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> did not know the Sunnah in detail he was not aware of the reality of the sayings that opposed it, and thus he thought that <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> says the Qur'aan is not created, like the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah. <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was the one who spoke with the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", and this means that the speech of Allaah resides eternally with the Self Allaah, inclusive of the Qur'aan and this is what is meant by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> when they say the Qur'aan is not created. However, as for the Qur'aan that  Jibreel recited to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) then that is created, and it is merely a created expression of the  meaning that resides with the Self of Allaah (the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee).     <P>
<b><u>Regarding <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and al-Istiwaa</u></b>    <P>
At the end <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> mentions the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> regarding Allaah above His creation, ascended above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without Him being confined by space. And this view was acquired by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and the earlier Ash'aris adopted this view which is that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, without that necessitating that He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) or confined by space.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
As we have mentioned, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> represents a school of thought trying to tread a middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl us-Sunnah, and thus we see he affirmed the attributes in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and he is in reality the leading Imaam of those <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> who affirmed the Attributes (the most well-known of whom are the Ash'arites) since his madhhab was adopted by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and then those following <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> thereafter. And within his creed there are grey areas where he attempts to flee from the saying of <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> but never really being able to separate himself from it in essence, and this is also something that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> fell into by natural extension.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To see the influence of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> upon the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <a href=series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.html>see this series</a>: <b>The Creed of the Early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> Differs From the Later (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'ari Scholars</b>.
