<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (al-mutaqaddimoon) had a creed that differed in respects to the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> (al-muta'akhkhiroon) - those who came after such as Abul-Mu'aali <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505) and ar-Raazee (d. 606) and others. The latter reverted back to much of the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation) of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. In general the earliest Ash'aris affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, and affirmed the attributes such as Face, Hands, Eyes, whilst negating <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> and without resorting to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or tafweed. These affirmations are found in the book of the earlier Ash'aris. Even though they still had some aspects of negating other attributes, their positions on the whole were much sounder and closer to the truth than the later <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>, the chief orator and spokesman of whom was Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee (d. 606H).    <P>
In opposition to the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence and is "<i>a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) but not like the created bodies</i>" (<a href=index264c.html?bolnh>as was said by factions amongst them</a>), the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, whilst negating <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> from Him, so they said "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>" opposing the likes of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. And as for Ahl us-Sunnah, they said Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and they neither affirmed the word "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" nor negated it <u>as both these approaches are innovations in the creed</u>. We have previously documented the view of the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> in this regard from al-Baqillani (<a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>see the links in this article</a>). All of these factions, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> and Ahl us-Sunnah affirmed Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, who adopted much of the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, denied Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> negated that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> because it contradicted their creed that "<i>Allaah is in every place</i>" and that "<i>He is not in one place exclusive to another</i>" which is their saying verbatim, and they claimed Allaah is in everything within His creation although He cannot be seen, nor perceived with any of the senses, despite being everywhere. <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> was the pioneer of this creed, after being confused by the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> known as the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> - whom he used to debate with (<a href=index7863.html?upfkv>see here</a>). So he concocted this creed, that Allaah is everywhere as a means to impress upon those Indian Philsophers that Allaah is all around them, however alongside that, Allaah cannot be perceived with any of the senses or described with anything, just like they (the Sumaniyyah) believed that souls occupy their bodies without them being able to perceive them, feel them, touch them, see them and so on. And this is where the bid'ahs of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> (Allaah dwelling within His creation) on the one hand, and  <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation of the Names and Attributes) on the other, arose.    <P>
<b>The Jahmites</b>, along with <b>the Mu'tazilah</b>, who devised the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" to demonstrate the createdness of the universe, and therefore proof of a creator, also denied Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> from the angle that it necessitated Allaah to be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body). Thus, they rejected Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and began to make ta'weels of the proofs in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah (some of which we will see a little later). So they plainly and flatly said, "<i>Allaah is not above the Heaven, nor is He above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, nor can it be said He is in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>)</i>" - since all of this, to them, necessitates He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) like the created bodies.    <P>
In reponse to them, <b>the Karraamiyyah</b> affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, however, to counter what amounted to a rejection of a Lord, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> said, "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), but not like the created bodies (ajsaam)</i>" - and saying this, they countered an innovation with another innovation - which is using the term "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" for Allaah.    <P>
And in response to the likes of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <b>the early Ash'aris</b> said, "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>" - and they likewise countered an innovation with another innovation, which is negating something not negated (or affirmed) in the Book and the Sunnah. See <a href=index264c.html?bolnh>this article</a> for more on the view of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the rulings found in the Ash'ari textbooks regarding their saying, "<i>He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) but not like the created bodies (ajsaam)</i>".    <P>
And it is important to note that the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> affirmed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without that necessitating that He is a body, however they added to their negations that "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>", that He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, "<i>Without contact and without confinement</i>" and what is similar to all of that to their affirmation that "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>".    <P>
<img src=assets/images/allaah-above-throne-factions.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And the strangest and most amazing thing is that the likes of ar-Raazee (d. 606H) and <b>the later <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'aris</b> oppose the very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> and argue the case for the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Mu'tazilite creed in their denial of there being a Lord above the Heaven and a Deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - utilizing the very same doubts and ta'weels of the texts that the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> refuted!!!    <P>
In this article we want to document the view of another of the early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a>, called Abul-Hasan 'Ali Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>. He was an associate of <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> whilst in Basrah, and was a student of his, he was a muhaddith, faqeeh and mufassir, and he has many works amongst which is "Fee <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> al-Ahaadeeth wa Mushkilaat al-Waaridah fis-Sifaat". He was also an associate of other prominent <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> such as al-Baqillani (d. 403H), al-Baahili (d. ~370H), al-Isfaraa'eenee (d. 401H), and <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H). Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> died around 380H. More information can be found in "Tabyeen Kadhib al-Muftaree" of Ibn 'Asaakir (p.195), the Tabaqaat ash-Shaafi'iyyah of as-Subkee (2/312).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying of the Early Ash'ari, Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> in Refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites Who Negate Their is a Deity Above the Heaven</font>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> quotes from Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> in the course of refuting the later <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari Fakhr ud-Din ar-Raazee who argued in favor of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as it related to Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (being above the creation).     <P>
What has been quoted from Ibn  Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is also mentioned in part by <u>al-Haafidh <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> in his book "al-Asmaa was-Sifaat"</u> (see end of article).    <P>
And it is also mentioned in full by <u>Imaam adh-Dhahabi in his "Mukhtasar al-Uluww"</u>, (pp. 250-252).     <P>
Notice in this quote that Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> is refuting the arguments of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who denied Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and he is refuting their ta'weels and doubts - the very same ones that the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> adopted! In particular he is refuting Abul-Qasim Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Mahmood al-Ka'bi al-Balkhi (d. 319H), a chief of a faction amongs the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> from Khurasaan called the Ka'biyyah.    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in the "Bayaan" (4/287-294), (and the quote of Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> has been separated in sections with relevant subtitles added by us):    <P>

And the meaning of "<a href="tags/al-istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>" is "al-i'tilaa (to ascend, to be elevated)", as the Arabs say, "I ascended upon the back of the beast", and "istawaytu over the roof", meaning I ascended it ('alawtuhu), and "the sun rose over my head", and "the bird rose over the crown of my head", with the meaning that it rose in the air and so it was above my head. </blockquote>    <P>
Note that Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> is explaining the linguistic meaning of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, and he has used these examples to explain what this contains of meaning - and this does not mean that Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> is just like that brought in these examples - and no one has ever said that or claimed that. And this is from the fabrications of the unjust contemporary (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'aris, that the people of the Sunnah claim Allaah ascends above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, like one mounts a beast and the likes. And here we have one of the early Ash'ari figureheads and students of <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and associate of the main <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, using these examples (from the texts) to establish the meaning and explanation of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> in the language.     <P>
It is from the ways of the neo-Jahmite Ash'aris to fabricate sayings against their opponents, and then proceed to refute them, as if they were the actual views of their opponents.    <P>
The affair here is like understanding <u>the meaning</u> of seeing and hearing through what we know of the hearing and seeing that the creation is described with. Since we only understand <u>meanings</u> of things through what we know of in the creation.  So once the meaning is understood, then we know Allaah has described Himself with those meanings, but the knowledge of the reality of how Allaah's hearing and seeing is, is denied, since <u>it is impossible for us to know that</u>. However, we understand that seeing has an understood meaning that is distinct to the  meaning of hearing and which are both distinct from the meanings of life (hayaat) and speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) and power (qudrah) and so on. And we know the meanings of all these attributes only through what we see and know from the creation.    <P>
So by these examples, the scholars - and in this case, Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, and early Ash'ari - establish what <u>the meaning</u> of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> is based on what we see and observe within the creation. As for how Allaah makes <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, (al-kaifiyyah), which is the actual reality of it, <u>then that is unknown</u> and it is not like that of the creation, and this is just like saying "<i>Allaah has hearing, but not like our hearing, seeing, but not like our seeing</i>", thus, we affirm the meanings of hearing and seeing, and similarly for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, we affirm it's meaning, but deny knowledge of its kaifiyyah (its reality) - and thus we do not say, "<i>istiwaa like our istiwaa</i>", just like we do not say, "<i>seeing like our seeing</i>" and so on.    <P>

It is said to him: If the reason for raising our hands to the sky was that the provisions are from there, and that those recording (the actions) reside in the heaven, then it would [likewise] be permissible for us to lower our hands in supplication towards the earth for the reason that Allaah brings about the vegetation, nutriments, and livelihood from it, and that (the earth) is their (the vegetation etc.) abode and from it were they created. Or (it can be said) that the angels are with them on the earth. Thus, the reason (for raising the hands to the sky) is not in the sky according to what they (the Mu'tazilah) have described.

This is despite the fact that al-Haafidh <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> quotes from him often in his "al-Asmaa was-Sifaat", that Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> is a known associate of the earlier Ash'aris whose mention has already preceded at the beginning of this article, that Ibn 'Asaakir mentions him in his "Tabyeen Kadhib al-Muftaree" and that as-Subki includes him in the "Tabaqaat ush-Shaafi'iyyah", and he is also in "Mu'jam al-Mu'allifeen".     <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He means by this (i.e. that Allaah is not mumaas and not mubaayin from the Throne), the separation, distinction of the Essence (of Allaah) which is with the meaning of disassociation (al-i'tizaal) and remoteness (at-tabaa'ud) [from the Throne], since touching (i.e. contact, closeness) and remoteness which is its opposite, and standing and sitting are from the descriptions of bodies, and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic is Ahad, Samad, He does not beget and nor was He begotten and there is none co-equal or comparable to Him. So what is permitted upon the (created) bodies is not permitted upon Him, the Blessed and Exalted.</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> is amongst those who makes <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of much of the texts that affirm Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (aboveness, over the Throne) with the meaning of "loftiness in status" and so on and  and he also expresses the negation of "makaan (location)", for Allaah - as is the way of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - and this is after his affirmation that <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is true and real and a created thing, that it is above the creation, and that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.     <P>
And in the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and some of the earlier Ash'aris we see their acceptance of the verses and ahaadeeth coupled with the influence of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in that they do not outright negate the manifest meanings of the texts (unlike the later <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'aris) but qualify these texts with their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and thus we see from them - the earlier Ash'aris in their generality - what amounts to the saying that:    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah is above His creation, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and He is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and nor is He confined in space (mutahayyiz), nor is He is said to have "location" nor confined by <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, neither touching <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, nor being remote from it ... etc.</blockquote>    <P>
So in general, they affirmed Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and separate and distinct from His creation, and these expressions of negation they added were on the basis of the theory of al-jawhar (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) and al-'arad (incidental attribute) and <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle) that they made fundamental to their creed. However, <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> is much more "Athari" than the others in the sense that he relies much upon the narrations, as is evidenced in his books, and elaborates less upon the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> philosophy of his predecessors (and of those who came after).    <P>
Because of the widespread knowledge of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the Creation, and the overwhelming strength of proof for this being established and widespread, the earlier Asha'ris - unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - were not able to repel this or oppose it, due to it being firmly established in the minds and hearts of the both the Scholars and the common folk, and thus they acknowledged the evidences. However, under the influence of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, they added phrasees of negation that were not known to the Salaf, such as "<i>He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>", "<i>He is not in space</i>", "<i>He is not in a location</i>", and so on, and this was partly in response to the likes of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who in turn, had responded to the innovation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> by saying that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - and all these factions were refuting innovation with another innovation. And this is because they all spoke in the affair of proving the universe is created and brought about through the language and terminology of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> such as <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and his "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar" - the Ten Categories - <a href=indexab1a.html?iowfm>learn more about that here</a>.    <P>
As for Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Athar, the Righteous Salaf, then they say, "Allaah is above the heaven, above His Throne" and when the need arose their Imaams added "with His Essence, separate and distinct from the creation" in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - and these are very clear unambiguous meanings that are already present in the Book and the Sunnah, and they expressed these words to refute the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who said Allaah is merged with the creation, within it, in every place, including the interiors of dogs and swines, exalted is Allaah from that with a lofty exaltation. But the Salaf did not affirm nor negate for Allaah the generalized ambiguous terms that the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> devised, those that are can comprise both meanings of truth and falsehood depending on the intent of the one speaking with them, such as "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>", "hayyiz", "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>", and so on.     <P>
This is because Allaah being above the creation and above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> does not necessitate that He is confined in space and the likes. What the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> define as "confinement by space" is only what is found within the boundaries of creation - and the creation has an outer limit where it comes to an end, and whatever is beyond that, then it is not said to be "confined by space", such that if Allaah was above the creation, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, he would be "confined" and the likes of these necessities which arose in the minds of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) because of what they made to be the foundation of their religion - "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and the theory of "<a href="tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>" (the indivisible particle).     <P>
These things <u>never occurred in the minds of the Salaf</u>, rather they submitted to what the narrations contained and passed them on intact without the <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and nor the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the Mu'attilah (with the inventions of meanings and phrases, i.e. ta'weels, that the Salaf never spoke with).    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> also narrates through Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, what was mentioned by Ibn al-A'raabi regarding <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>. He (<a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>) says in "al-Asmaa was-Sifaat" (2/314):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And from what Abul-Hasan bin Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a> has narrated from Abu Abdullaah Naftawaih (who) said:  Abu Sulaymaan - meaning Dawud - narrated to us, he said: We were with Ibn al-A'raabi and a man came to him and said, "What is the meaning of The Most Merciful ascended above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>?".

So he (the man) said, "Rather its meaning of His saying "istawaa" is "istawlaa" (He conquered)". So Ibn al-A'raabi said, "And what informs (of that)? The Arabs do not say, "so and so istawlaa (meaning conquered) the throne" unless he has some opposition from it, so whichever of the two is victorious, then it is said, "Istawlaa alayhi (he conquered the other)".
