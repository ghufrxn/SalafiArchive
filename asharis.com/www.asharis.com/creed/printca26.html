<div class='sidebar'>Please make sure you read <a href=index5264.html?cgkfw>Part 1</a> of this new series of articles as it summarizes the essential points of our rebuttal in the first series of articles.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/barelwi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Barelwi</font></a> Mullah's Counter-Response</font>    <P>
This is the counter response penned by <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> against our six articles:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/asraar-rasheed-coventry-res.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We will summarize what he wrote in his counter response and it revolves around <u><b>one main point</b></u> which he stated at the beginning:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... during his rebuttal [meaning our rebuttal here at <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com] (it was stated) that it was from the custom of the Righteous Salaf to make tafseel (detail) when mentioning their aqidah, and this presumption is an error from him...</blockquote>    <P>
The rest of his statement is really an attempt to expand upon this one point. This is all the <a href='tags/barelwi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Barelwi</font></a> Mullah chose to respond to from our articles and he has employed <u>great deception</u> in the process. The narrations he brings in the rest of the statement are basically an attempt to argue for this point he has just made, i.e. that the way of the Salaf was not one of detail (tafseel) but in fact avoidance of tafseel - and this indicates the depth of his ignorance as we shall see, of both history and the way of the Salaf.    <P>
We will tackle  this in the following manner. <u>First</u> - in this article - we shall show how <u>he has committed academic fraud</u> in misrepresenting, and twisting the intent of this disputant (us), and part of honesty in discussion is to correctly characterize the view of your opponent and not lie upon him or twist his words, or deliberately fail to address it in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, despite it being made so clear such that it cannot possibly be misunderstood. <u>Second</u> - in the next article - we will comment on the narrations he has brought inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/barelwi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Barelwi</font></a> Mullah's Deception</font>    <P>
This is illustrated when we go back to our articles and quote from them to show that it was made very clear as to what is meant when we say that <b>the way of the Salaf in aqidah was to make tafseel (detail)</b>. Here is one of our statements from <a href=indexd293.html?ajona>Part 1</a> of our first series of articles. Oe can see his deception despite the fact that what we have written is as clear as night and day and leaves absolutely no ambiguity about the point being made:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Third:</b> The way of the Salaf is <u>tafseel (detail)</u> when it comes to mentioning and presenting their creed, and one would have thought that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> would have practically followed in their footsteps alongside this glittering introduction that appears to venerate and respect the Salaf and highlight the excellence and correctness of their way. Instead, as we shall see in what follows, Asrar has filled his entire page with generalizations which appear to be in agreement with the way of the Salaf in wording, but the reality of what <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> intends by these statements and the truthfulness of his claim can only be verified when he proceeds to mention his creed in detail, something he has quite clearly avoided and for no vain reason either. <b>Of the approximately 80 or so books that we could list written by the Salaf from the mid second century until the early fourth century (from 150H to 320H)</b> on the issues of creed in which they opposed the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, we find that whilst they (the Salaf) outline generalized principles that summarize their creed, <u>they give specific details on specific issues</u> that pertain to the Attributes of Allaah, <b>such that there would no confusion left in the mind of anybody who reads their statements</b> about the difference between what they were upon of <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> without tahreef and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and what the blameworthy <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were upon of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> through tahreef (called ta'weel) and against whom all of these books were authored by the Salaf. People like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> probably recognize this reality (as in, mentioning specifics will quickly expose you and your creed as being in conflict witht that of the Salaf). If they were to start writing down exactly what attributes they affirm as attributes of the essence (dhaat) and what attributes they do not, then the wider audience would quickly identify that this is characteristic of a creed founded upon <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and not based upon the way and methodology of the Salaf even if it is decorated with the generalizations and the broad principles of the Salaf like those <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> has mentioned in his statement above, <b>but which he explicitly opposes as soon as he delves into mentioning or hinting at his creed on the subject of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and al-uluww</b> and revealing that he is a follower of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> (who followed the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> for Allaah and His <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah) and not a follower of the Salaf and nor of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> or <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> or the very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> - and we have extensively documented their position on <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah in numerous articles on this site, so please refer to them, and we also explained the reality of the creed of the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, who were the staunchest of people against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah.</blockquote>    <P>
And in <a href=index6dc9.html?gbokn>Part 3</a> we stated:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>But this is the intent of <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>, to treat the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah as <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and in this he is in reality jingoing with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> whilst making a pretence of subscribing to the Salaf, and he thought he could conceal and clothe himself with vague, generalized statements and make it look as if he is wearing the attire of the Salaf, when in reality he is wearing no attire and his deception is plain to see for anyone with baseerah. For if he was truly a follower of the Salaf, he would have followed their particular methodology in laying down his creed, and their methodology is known in their books, it is detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> with generalized negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>. <b>Pick up the books of the Salaf written in the second and third centuries on the topic of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> of Allaah, the Exalted and what do you see?</b> Then compare that with the deception <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> thought he could pull off with this one page of generalizations and obscurities.</blockquote>    <P>
And also in <a href=index6dc9.html?gbokn>Part 3</a>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Fourth:</b> To expand further on the bolded sentence in the last paragraph, when one looks at the second and third centuries after hijrah, we see that this was when <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> appeared in theological matters and it was carried by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> in the second century (100H-200H) and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> in the third century (200H-300H), before the Ash'aris and Maturidis appeared in the fourth century.  Now, though there was gross <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> present with the Raafidi Mutakallimeen, and likewise <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> present with the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, the overwhelming majority of the speech of the Salaf was against the Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. In fact, their speech against the Mu'attilah dwarfs their speech about the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, and this is plain and manifest when one surveys all the books authored by the Salaf on matters of creed in the second and third centuries against <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. The point we are leading to here then is that when this is the historical reality and when it is the case that the war of the Salaf was overwhelmingly against the Mu'attilah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, Allaah's Speech and the Qur'aan, the Ru'yah, and <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, then if a person was truly following the way of the Salaf, then he would have followed their way in writing his creed. <b>Which is detailed and specific <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation)</b>. However, because <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is in reality on the side of his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> ancestors, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who entered this <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> into the Ummah and through whom it came to the Ash'aris and Maturidis (after passing through the Kullaabiyyah), <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> has not followed the way of the Salaf at all, because he is in reality a disputant to the Salaf. If he did follow the Salaf as he claims, we would have seen an altogether different style and different content in the writing of his creed. Instead, he tried to remain as vague and general as possible, pretending to venerate and respect the way of the Salaf, focusing on negation (nafee) mostly...</blockquote>    <P>
And we also stated in <a href=indexdcef.html?zyscp>Part 4</a> - [and it is recommended you read this article because we explained and clarified in detail the shubhah (doubt) of the neo-Jahmites like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> towards Allaah's <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and we quoted from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> certain statements which are a refutation of him and his likes who drink from the fountation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and then hide behind the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> who were also influenced by a degree of that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> but were not as far from the truth compared to the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and others who came after] - so we said in that <a href=indexdcef.html?zyscp>earlier article</a>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Sixth:</b> <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is not following the way of the Salaf, he is lying in his claim, rather he is following the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and all he has done is to make vague general statements which are mostly based around negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and so on, in order to give the illusion he is following the Salaf, and avoided committing himself to specific <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>. However, as we said in a previous article, there is no escape from mentioning at least something besides the generalizations (even if it is just hinted at) otherwise, the statement of creed would be meaningless to anyone who reads it, and for this reason we see that he addressed the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah in a very indirect way and  he addressed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> at the very end of his statement, which is the subject we will tackle next inshaa'Allaah, proving that He is a Jahmee in that regard, and certaintly not a follower of the Salaf, or <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, or <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, or al-Qalanisee, or Ibn Mahdee al-Tabaree, or even al-Baqillaani, rather he is with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
From the above quotes, our intent should be very clear and it is utterly amazing that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> then pretends to address an issue other than what was clarified in the above passages. This is because the <a href='tags/barelwi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Barelwi</font></a> Mullah was unable to answer anything in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>. And also  because entering and committing himself to a serious academic study of the implications of what we have written about the true roots of the creed of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> would then expose the game and unveil the realities, and the people in general would quickly see that there is a much bigger wider picture and perspective that is deliberately kept hidden by todays <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and Maturidis about historical realities. Once that door is opened, and people are curious, <u>and they begin to study objective historical fact</u>, they will realize what great difference there is between the actual way of the Salaf and the fraudulent attempts of today's Ash'aris and Maturidis to cleverly manoeuvre and position themselves and their creed as being in agreement with the Salaf.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><font style='font-size:17px;line-height:25px;'>We were not speaking about the Salaf making tafseers (explanations) and giving <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> (explaining a howness) for the attributes, because the Salaf denied these matters, but <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> pretended to refute us and our articles by making a show to his audience that the Salaf never delved into the tafseer and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of the attributes, which is not the issue being discussed. <b>The issue is that the Salaf made specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) which goes above and beyond the restricted <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of factions of the Mutakallimin (Ahl al-Kalam)</b>. However, the Innovators try to conceal and keep this hidden from the general masses by strictly following a policy of presenting only those statements of the Salaf that <a href=index291b.html?vxilx>were made in specific historical contexts</a> [PDF], such as "<i>Pass them on as they have come, without asking how</i>" and which allows them to cloak the real issue which is: Did the Salaf found their creed upon the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-kalam</font></a> (huduth al-ajsaam) that you founded your creed upon and is the <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) of the Salaf of the attributes the same in nature and scope as your affirmation and are their presumptions about the revealed texts the same as yours? So presenting their creed in the matter of the attributes of Allaah by <u>only generalized, non-specific statements</u> is a deliberate policy intended to deceive the common-folk. However, once a person is in the fold, in their private circles, they teach the specific detailed creed from the books of the latecomers like <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, al-Sanusi and others and in which there is pure <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and gross <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of that which the Salaf actually affirmed. Thus, there is a tactical policy of presenting the idea to the general public that <u>the Salaf only had generalized statements in creed</u>, this is intended to disarm the intended targets and victims. Once that has been achieved and these people then sit in their private gatherings, circles and institutions, they show hypocrisy and start teaching their "detailed" creed and delving into the detailed matters of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and Allaah's attributes and the creed founded upon al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, the conceptual tools which came to them from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>) - whilst before, openly and publicly, they had a different stance about tafseel in matters of belief.</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
The issue being raised is that when we look into the books of the Salaf (and those of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and al-Ash'ari) we see them stating their positions on a wide variety of issues in the matter of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Aqidah and giving specifics about what attributes they affirm, such as Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, and His face, hands, eyes and the rest of the attributes mentioned in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the aathaar.  Whilst there are certainly many sayings of the Salaf in which a generalized, summary belief is mentioned, in terms of the general approach, there is to be found alongside that in the speech of the Salaf, specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation). We will give just an example here from what was stated by Imam al-Tirmidh&#299; (d. 274H) who reported the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jam&#257;&#703;ah in affirming the &#7779;if&#257;t khabariyyah :    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It has been stated by more than one person from the People of Knowledge about this had&#299;th <u>and what resembles it from the narrations</u>, such as (those of) the Attributes, and the descent of our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, to the lowest heaven every night. They said the narrations regarding this are established and they are to be believed. No presumptions are to be made and it is not said "How?" The likes of this has been related from M&#257;lik [bin Anas], Sufy&#257;n Ibn &#703;Uyainah and &#703;Abd All&#257;h bin al-Mub&#257;rak, who all said about such ah&#257;d&#299;th, "Leave them as they are, without asking how." Such is the saying of the People of Knowledge from the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jam&#257;&#703;ah. <b>However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> opposed these narrations and said "This is tashb&#299;h!"</b> But, All&#257;h the Exalted, has mentioned in various places in His Book, the attribute of <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), as-sama&#703; (hearing), and al-basr (seeing), <i>yet the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> make ta&#702;w&#299;l of these verses, explaining them (fassar&#363;h&#257;) in a way, other than how they are explained by the people of knowledge</i>.  They say, "Indeed, All&#257;h did not create &#256;dam with His own hand - they say that hand (yad) means the power (qudrah) of All&#257;h." Ish&#257;q ibn Ibrah&#299;m al-R&#257;h&#363;yah said: Tashb&#299;h (resemblance) is if it is said: "Hand like my hand, or similar to my hand", or it is said: "Hearing like my hearing, or similar to my hearing", then this is tashb&#299;h. But if what is being said is what Allah has said, "Hand, Hearing, Seeing" and it is not asked how, nor is it said, "Like my hearing, or similar to my hearing" then it is not tashb&#299;h. All&#257;h, the Most Blessed, Most High, said in His Book, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and he is the all-Hearer, the all-Seer</b>." (42:11) [Al-Sunan of at-Tirmidh&#299;, 1/128-129.]</blockquote>    <P>
Why can't today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as Ash'aris follow the same way of making <u>specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of all that is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and aathar with general negation of likeness</u> instead of pretending to follow the Salaf by parading generalized statements deprived of the specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> found in the words and writings of the Salaf? The reason is that if they went beyond the generalizations and vague expressions and committed themselves to this approach, they would be forced to reveal that they do not affirm what the Salaf affirm, and that they are not in reality operating upon the uniform principle of the Salaf of affirming everything in the Book and the Sunnah without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and without tafweed and without tahreef, and that they are only playing games when they try to hide behind these generalized statements (which we shall look at in Part 3). Thus, if they were to be honest and say: <i>We affirm the attributes of life, knowledge, will, power, hearing, seeing and speech</i>, and some of the other corollory attributes they affirm, <b>all people will come to realize that they are not following the Salaf</b> and that the Salaf (and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Ash'ari) made specific <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of much more than this as is clearly  abundant and evident from their works. So there is a reason why these deceptive Ash'aris and Maturidis choose this particular method in trying to conceal the reality of their creed, they are simply treading carefully so as not to open the door to the curious mind and raise too many questions.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Interestingly, when the Salaf rejected <u>making tafseer</u> (explanation) of the attributes, such as what occurs in al-Tirmidhi's statements above, "<i>yet the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> make ta&#702;w&#299;l of these verses, explaining them (fassar&#363;h&#257;) in a way, other than how they are explained by the people of knowledge</i>" they were referring to what was being done by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in their time who were making tafseer's (in other words ta'weels) for those attributes which were not known to the Salaf (such as <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> = power, <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> = conquering, <a href='tags/al-arsh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/arsh.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Arsh</font></a></font></a> = dominion). Thus, when the Salaf said that the correct way is to make <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) without tafseer, ma'naa and the likes, these statements were made against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who were bringing explanations (tafseer) and  meanings (ma'naa) besides what the texts came with. This matter has been dealt with in detail <a href=index291b.html?vxilx>in our PDF article here</a> and we shall revisit it again inshaa'Allaah in the next part to this article.</div>    <P>
Once more, the point we are making is that if you go and look at the  books of the Salaf authored in creed in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> you will see a type of specific and detailed <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) as opposed to just a mere collection of generalized statements alone. <b>You will see them quoting scores and scores of aathaar (hadeeth and narrations) that pertain to the attributes explaining how the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> denied these aathaar and twisted the verses which pertain to the attributes. Indicating that the <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) with the Salaf was specific and detailed - as in extensive, and it is very unlike the <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> of some the later factions of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Ash'aris, Maturidis) which was a restricted one, bound by the necessities of their proof of huduth al-ajsaam which was taken by their ancestors in <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagans.</b>. To go through all the books of creed of the Salaf and then systematically list the specific attributes of Allaah that they mention and affirm in opposition to the predominant deviants of their time (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah) would be a worthy exercise here and it would show that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> and his likes are on the side of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against the Salaf (and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Ash'ari) and that when they attack Ahl al-Sunnah with the accusation of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, they are in fact simply representing the attacks of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>  upon the Imaams of the Salaf, and upon <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (and the very early Kullaabi Ash'aris) for affirming Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> dhaatiyyah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So notice how this intellectually defunct <a href='tags/barelwi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Barelwi</font></a> Mullah failed to address anything in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> with respect the many realities and facts which we raised. This is because either he himself is ignorant of these historical facts and realities, or he is not ignorant but dares not challenge them or contest them because it will open a door these people simply do not want to be opened. One of exploration, new knowledge, new insight. This to people like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> is a Pandora's box, a nightmare...</div>    <P>
Insha'Allaah in Part 3, we will look at the citations <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> brought from <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> as part of the general ploy to keep the reality and origins of the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creed hidden from the general masses.    <P>
