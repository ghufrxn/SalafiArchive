<div class='sidebar'><blockquote> <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is upon the theology of <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>, those who adopted the conceptual tools and baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and used them to distort the Book of Allaah and deny (aspects of) the Prophetic Sunnah. This faction appeared in the early first century hijrah when al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought in the use of Aristotelian and neo-Platonic language to speak about theology. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took it from them, and then a series of sects appeared who took this same path, including the <u>Raafidee Hishaamiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u> and others. Amongst them were <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b> and amongst them were <b>Mu'attilah</b> and both (errant) ways are founded upon the same <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> which is a term that represents the philosophical baggage of the Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) who incorporated the metaphysical language and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in theological discussion and debate. Before reading this series of articles you must do some background research to be able to follow along. The recommended articles for study are <a href=index17f5.html?lxtuo>this article</a> (provides good historical background and context), <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a> (<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>), <a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>this series</a> (<b>Destroying the Allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and Tashbih Against Ahl al-Sunnah</b>) and <a href=index1d7c.html?qcsxk>Part 4</a>  and <a href=indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5</a> of a series dealing with the creation or eternity of the universe between the Mutakallimeen (Ahl al-Kalaam, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots) and the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (al-Farabi, Ibn Sina). The reader is also encouraged to study articles on this site through which it will become clear that todays Ash'aris do not follow Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah), but those later ones (<u><a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a></u>, <u>al-Qushayree</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u>, <u>al-Raazee</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a></u>) who came after him and, through their own input and influence, took <b>the early Kullaabi-Ash'ari creed</b> in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Soofiyyah, Gnostic illuminists, eventually merging <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> as was done by the later ones. The evidence for that is overwhelming and can be found in articles on this site.     <P>
<b>What is known as "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" today is not what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> died upon. Many of the smart and shrewd ones amongst todays <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (posing as Ash'aris) know this very well and hence, they describe "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" as a "<u>dynamic approach in theology</u>" and not necessarily a fixed set of doctrines (because of the presence of much conflict, contradiction and inconsistency that is inherent in the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school). This is just one example of the many frauds they perpetrate against innocent Muslims who simply want to know the creed brougth by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and believed by the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), which is in accord with the <i>fitrah</i> and which is devoid of the conceptual baggage of that heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (a cover label for "<i>philosophy</i>") which they entered into the Ummah, split the Muslims and brought trials and calamities upon them.</b>    <P>
As for <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>, an online biographical account states:    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/ibrahim-osi-efa.gif style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" align="right" border="1" border=0>Shaykh Ibrahim was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He was blessed with the opportunity to study several classical disciplines at the hands of some of the holders of the tradition such as Murabit al-Haj, al-Habib Umar b. Hafiz and Shaikh Hassan al-Hindi. Initially studying for three years in Syria and Mauritania, Ustaz Ibrahim was then blessed with the opportunity to spend over six years in the illuminated city of Tarim, Hadramaut where he studied under the qualified hands of teachers such as al-Habib Kazim al-Saqqaf, al-Habib Ali al-Jifri and al-Shaikh Umar Husain al-Khatib. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> was one of the founders of several Islamic initiatives including the Ibn Abbas Institute, Starlatch Press, Badr Language Institute and the Greensville Trust. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> currently resides in Liverpool, England with his wife and two children.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that the teachers of this man are <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, gnostic-illuminists, mystics and those calling to saint-worship - matters which <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was free and innocent of.     <P>
In this series of articles we are going to deconstruct the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> which is taught through his course entitled <b><a href='tags/micro-madrasa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Micro Madrasa</font></a></b>. Our aim in these articles is to allow the reader to see the clear difference between what the Righteous Salaf were upon and between what the Ash'aris and Maturidis inherited from <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. In the course of these articles many of the historical and academic frauds of those posing as "Ash'aris" today and the Maturidis will become clear by Allaah's permission.     <P>
Throughout this series we will refer to <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> and his theological family as <b>the Jahmiyyah</b>, since <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (and al-Ja'd bin Dirham) are the primary origin points for their theology, and the term "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" is really an umbrella term for all those factions who built their theology upon the conceptual baggage and terminology brought into the Ummah by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the first century hijrah.   </blockquote></div> <P>




<p><font class='titleHeadline'>What is Divinity and How is it Spoken About?</font>    <P>
<blockquote>  In  <b>Introducing Theology</b>, <u>the Ten Principles</u> (Year 1, Session 1), <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> starts his discussion of the subject matter of theology, the first of which is "divinity":    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibosiefa-micro-004-divinity.jpg width="550" border="1" border=0>  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>01. </b> We have established in the previous lessons that the <b>Kalam dynasty</b> of families (<u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, <u>Raafidah</u>, <u>Kullabiyyah</u>, <u>Karramiyyah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, <u>Salimiyyah</u>) founded their theology on a rational proof (<i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>) which they made to the foundation of the deen of Islaam. This rational proof rests upon the conceptual baggage and language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. As a result of this, they were forced to define their deity through this same language, hence the Aristotelian flavour that is readily apparent in their theological language (<i>bodies</i>, <i>accidents</i>) and something in which they were preceded by the <u>Hellenized Jews</u>, <u>Christians</u> and <u><a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a></u> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see series</a>). As a result, all these families denied <u>at least something</u> from the names, attributes, and actions of Allaah in order to validate their proof and remain consistent with its premises. Their subsequent (internal) disputes are on subsidiary matters after their agreement on foundations. They considered this proof to be something upon which the validity of Islam itself lies, despite the fact that the argument they devised does not actually prove any "act of creation" took place in reality and can equally be used (due to its inherent flaws) to demonstrate matter is eternal and no creation took place. Further, the belief in a creator and originator is <i>fitriyy</i> (innate), <i>dhurooriyy</i> (necessary) and does not need long-winded, false arguments resting upon corrupt principles. As a result of this focus on proving Allaah's existence (through a method that relies upon corrupt foundations) and restricting the discussion of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> around it, they neglected the actual <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> that the Messengers called to which is to single out Allah in worship (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1601;&#1585;&#1575;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) , and they also wrongly defined worship (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577;</span>), claiming worship is only worship when accompanied with belief in the Ruboobiyyah (lordship) of the entity being worshipped. This in turn  justified the invoking of saints and the dead for rescue, aid, cure and the likes. All of these affairs began to appear amongst the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> and Maturidis when the toll of restricting <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> only to Ruboobiyyah began to manifest itself.      <P>
<b>02. </b> After laying down the foundations that will lead his students down the path of <b>Aristotelian Tawhid</b>, (the <b>Tawhid of al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b>) and a potential lifetime of mental <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> and intellectual abuse, <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> then speaks of the three main subject areas of the theology he previously defined (see <a href=indexd96e.html?pdoppcs>Part 3</a>) and the first of  them is "<i>Divinity which attempts to understand what is <u>necessary</u>, <u>impossible</u> and <u>permissible</u> for God, Most High</i>." As you will have gathered from previous articles (see   <a href=index7b25.html?moitybx>here</a>,  <a href=index9bff.html?dglhpiw>here</a>, and   <a href=indexd96e.html?pdoppcs>here</a>), the road has already forked into two and we now see the road of the condemned <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> going further and further away from the road of the Prophets and Messengers. We start to see the clear difference between the underlying conception on the basis of which either party speaks about their Lord. And the explanation of the difference between the two is as follows:    <P>
<b>03. </b> <u>Ahl al-Sunnah:</u> The followers of the revealed Books and sent Messengers firmly believe that Allah is the <u>most-knowledgeable</u> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) of His own self, the <u>most eloquent</u> in speech (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) and intended nothing but guidance, direction  to His creation through what He revealed in the language He used in describing Himself with attributes and actions. Likewise they firmly believe that the Messenger is the <u>most knowledgeable</u> of the creation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;</span>) regarding Allaah, the Most High, and <u>most eloquent</u> in speech in the creation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1601;&#1589;&#1581;</span>)  and <u>most sincere</u> in intending good (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1606;&#1589;&#1581;</span>) for the Ummah, and he used language and words to describe His Lord, being inspired by His Lord to do so. Upon this they have <b>a uniform consistent principle</b> for the sum whole of whatever Allaah or His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) described Him with. The people of the Sunnah affirmed every attribute mentioned in the Book and the Sunnah, <b>without any distinction</b> and applied <u>a uniform principle</u> to them all, which is <i><a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a></i> (affirmation) without <i><a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a></i> (likeness), which itself follows on from a more fundamental principle which is that there is no <i><a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a></i> in anything which Allaah has described Himself with at all (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1587;&#1614; &#1603;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1579;&#1618;&#1604;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1612;</span>), "<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>" (42:11). Because Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, the reality of which therefore is unknowable, we have no way of knowing how attributes subsist with His essence and how their realities are and thus there is no reason or argument for denying anything from His attributes with the argument that it necessitates tasbheeh and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, since that necessity has been expressly denied by revealed text. As such there is no caution in affirming anything Allaah affirmed for himself whilst denying <i><a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a></i>.  Thus, there is no distinction between Allaah being al-Aleem, al-Qadeer, al-Raheem, al-Hakeem, al-Samee' and His having attributes of <i>ilm</i>, <i>qudrah</i>, <i>rahmah</i>, <i>hikmah</i>, <i>sam'</i> and His having the attributes of face (<i>wajh</i>), hand (<i>yad</i>) and eye (<i>ayn</i>). All of this is taken upon a uniform consistent principle of affirmation (<i><a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a></i>) without asking or specifying how (<i>kayf</i>). The fundamental issue here is that it is <b>the revelation</b> that is <b>given precedence</b> and it is the spring and foundation of speaking about Allaah and Ahl al-Sunnah see no conflict between revelation (naql) and reason (aql). For this reason, we find statements from the Imaams of the Salaf clearly and eplicitly explaining this and we can cite three examples that exemplify the way of the Salaf and a further citation from Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself.    <P>
<b>04.</b> First, the testimony of <u>Imaam al-Tirmidhi</u> (d. 279H) in his Sunan (1/128-129), "It has been stated by more than one person from the People of Knowledge about this had&#299;th and what resembles it from the narrations, such as (those of) the Attributes, and the descent of our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, to the lowest heaven every night. They said the narrations regarding this are established and they are to be believed. No presumptions are to be made and it is not said "How?" The likes of this has been related from M&#257;lik [bin Anas], Sufy&#257;n Ibn &#703;Uyainah and &#703;Abd All&#257;h bin al-Mub&#257;rak, who all said about such ah&#257;d&#299;th, "<i>Leave them as they are, without asking how</i>." Such is the saying of the People of Knowledge from the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jam&#257;&#703;ah. However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> opposed these narrations and said "<i>This is tashb&#299;h!</i>" But, All&#257;h the Exalted, has mentioned in various places in His Book, the attribute of <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), as-sama&#703; (hearing), and al-basr (seeing), yet the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> make ta&#702;w&#299;l of these verses, explaining them (fassar&#363;h&#257;) in a way, other than how they are explained by the people of knowledge.  They say, "Indeed, All&#257;h did not create &#256;dam with His own hand - they say that hand (yad) means the power (qudrah) of All&#257;h." Ish&#257;q ibn Ibrah&#299;m al-R&#257;h&#363;yah said: Tashb&#299;h (resemblance) is if it is said: "Hand like my hand, or similar to my hand", or it is said: "Hearing like my hearing, or similar to my hearing", then this is tashb&#299;h. But if what is being said is what Allah has said, "Hand, Hearing, Seeing" and it is not asked how, nor is it said, "Like my hearing, or similar to my hearing" then it is not tashb&#299;h. All&#257;h, the Most Blessed, Most High, said in His Book, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and he is the all-Hearer, the all-Seer</b>." (42:11)" End quote from al-Tirmidhi.     <P>
<b>05.</b> The saying of <u>Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari</u> who said, addressing the same doubt (in <i>al-Ibaanah</i>, ta&#7717;q&#299;q, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Ma&#7717;m&#363;d, Egypt, 1977, pp. 136-137): "Issue: And it is said to them: What has led you to reject that All&#257;h, the Exalted meant two hands by His saying, "<b>With my two hands (biyadayya)</b>" (38:75) and not two favours? If they say: Because if <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand) is not [with the meaning of] favour (ni&#703;mah) then it is but a limb (j&#257;ri&#7717;ah). It is said to them: Why have you judged that if hand is not favour, then it is but a limb? ... They said: <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), when it is not favour in what is observed, it is but a limb. It is said to them: If you are working [on the basis] of what is observed [in creation] and you judged All&#257;h by way of it, then likewise, we do not find any living thing  (hayyan) in the creation except as a body, flesh and blood. So judge All&#257;h with  that (too) [i.e. as He is also living], exalted is All&#257;h from that. And if not then you are [obliged] to abandon your saying because you are contradicting your very own justification [in argument].  And if you affirm [one who is] living but not like the living [creatures], then what has led to you reject that He has two hands which All&#257;h, the Exalted informed about, which are neither two favours nor two limbs, and nor like the hands [of the creatures]. Likewise, it is said to them: We do not find any mudabbir (controller), hak&#299;m (wise), except as a human, but then you affirm that the world has a mudabbir and &#7717;ak&#299;m who is not like a human, and you opposed what is observed [in the creation] and you contradicted your own justification [in argument against us]. Therefore do not prevent from the affirmation of two hands that are not two favours or two limbs for the reason that it is opposed to what is observed." End quote. <b>Note:</b> What Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> intends here is: Don't deny the affirmation of two hands for All&#257;h upon the argument that if they are not two favours and not two limbs, then this opposes what is observed in creation, since we only know in what is observed, either hand as "favour", or hand as "a limb". So al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; is refuting this argument of the Mu&#703;tazilah and explains that you are in contradiction when you affirm other matters for All&#257;h, because the same argument equally applies there as well, since we only know of other meanings established for Allaah through the manifestation of these meanings in man, however, it is not necessitated that the realities associated with these meanings are the same.    <P>
<b>06.</b> And the saying of <u>Abu Uthman al-Sabuni</u> (d. 449H) as occurs in his <i>Aqidat al-Salaf wa As-hab il-Hadeeth</i> (pp. 161-165), "I say, and with All&#257;h lies success: The A&#7779;&#7717;&#257;b al-&#7716;&#257;d&#299;th - may All&#257;h safeguard their living and have mercy upon their dead - testify to uniqueness (wa&#7717;d&#257;niyyah) for All&#257;h, and to messengership and prophethood for the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). They know their Lord through His attributes which His revelation (wa&#7717;&#299;, tanz&#299;l) has spoken of or which His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) testified for Him, upon what has been related in the authentic narrations from him, and which the trustworthy and reliable have transmitted from him.  They afffirm for All&#257;h, lofty in His Majesty, what All&#257;h affirms for Himself in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and they do not believe in tashb&#299;h (resemblance) between His attributes with the attributes of His creation. So they say: Indeed He (All&#257;h) created &#256;dam with His Hand, as He has textually stated, the Sublime, in His saying, mighty is the one saying (it), "<b>O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to one whom I created with My own Two Hands</b>" (38:75). And they do not distort the words from their proper places (meanings)  by interpreting two Hands to mean "two favors", or "two powers" [with] the distortion (tahr&#299;f) of the Mu&#703;tazilah and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>  - may All&#257;h destroy them. And nor do they specify a how for them or resemble them with the hands of the creation [with] the tashb&#299;h (resemblance) of the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, may All&#257;h forsake them ... And likewise they say with respect to all the attributes whose mention has been revealed in the Qur&#702;&#257;n, and which the authentic narrations have mentioned of hearing (sam&#703;), seeing (ba&#7779;r), eye (&#703;ayn), face (wajh), knowledge (&#703;ilm), power (quwwah, qudrah), might (&#703;izzah), greatness (&#703;adhmah), wish (ir&#257;dah), will (mash&#299;'ah), speech (qawl, kal&#257;m), pleasure (ri&#7693;&#257;), dislike (sakha&#7789;), love (&#7717;ubb), hatred (bugh&#7693;), rejoicement (far&#7717;), laughter (&#7693;a&#7717;ak) and other than them,  without making tashb&#299;h of anything from them with the attributes of the created ones. Rather, they stop at what All&#257;h, the Exalted said and what His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, without any addition to it, and nor any annexation to it, and nor making taky&#299;f of it, or tashb&#299;h, or ta&#7717;r&#299;f (distortion), or tabd&#299;l (altering), or taghy&#299;r (change), or nor ceasing the [meaning] of the word from what is known by the Arabs [regarding it] and devising [instead] a rejected metaphorical meaning for it (ta&#702;w&#299;l)."

<b>07.</b> And the saying of <u>al-Khatib al-Bagdhadi</u> (d. 463H) as cited by <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> (<i>Mukhtasar al-uluww</i>, p. 273, no. 332), "As for what has been reported of such Attributes in the Authentic Compilations (as-Sunan as-Sihaah) - the madhhab of the Salaf - may Allaah be pleased with them all - is <u>to affirm them</u>, and <u>to carry them upon their apparent meanings (alaa dhawaahirihaa)</u> and <u>to deny [knowledge of] their kaifiyyah (their true reality)</u> and [to negate] <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resemblance) from them. <b>And the principle in this matter is: That speaking about the Attributes <u>is a branch of speaking about the Essence (Dhaat)</u> and thus follows it exactly and takes its example. </b> So when it is known that [making] affirmation of the Lord of all the Worlds - the Mighty and Majestic - that it is an affirmation of existence, not an affirmation of defining the reality [of His existence] (tahdeed) and how it is (<a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>) [in reality] , then it is the same for affirming His Attributes. <u>Indeed, it is an affirmation of their existence</u>, not an affirmation of defining their reality (tahdeed) and how they are (<a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>) [in reality]. So when we say: Allaah has <u>a hand</u>, <u>hearing</u> and <u>seeing</u>, then these are Attributes which Allaah the Exalted has affirmed for Himself  and we do not say: The meaning of hand is 'power'  and nor do we say: The meaning of hearing and seeing is 'knowledge'. And nor do we say: They are limbs and instruments for action. And we do not resemble them with [those] hands, [and faculties of] hearing and sight which are the limbs and the instruments of action [in created beings]. And we say: Affirming them is obligatory because at-Tawqeef (the texts of the Qur'aan and the Sunnah) have reported them and it is obligatory to negate <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resemblance) from them, due to the saying of the Blessed and Exalted: "<b>There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</b>." (42:11) and His saying - the Mighty and Majestic "<b>And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him</b>" (112:4)." End quote from al-Khatib.     <P>
<b>08. </b> So note that these are three citations and in all of them they are citing that which "<b>the People of Knowledge</b>", "<b>the people of Hadeeth</b>" and "<b>the Salaf</b>" are all united upon, in opposition to the Kalam Heretics from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Muta'zilah and whoever traversed their way from the later ones (Ash'aris and Maturidis).      <P>
<b>09.</b> <u>Ahl al-Kalaam:</u> As for the followers of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (who relied upon the conceptual baggage and language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in theological matters), then they have an entirely different perception and starting point. <b>This follows naturally from their false theological foundations</b>. Because Aristotelian terminology is the basis of the construction of their argument for what they consider to be <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (proving Allah's existence through <i>al-ajsaam</i> <i>wal-a'raad</i>), they have to remain consistent with the necessities (<i>lawaazim</i>) that are required of them in order for their proof to be valid. This essentially means negating the <b>Ten Categories</b> (<i>al-Jawhar wal-Arad</i>) of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> from Allaah in order to exempt Allaah from being like the bodies (<i>ajsaam</i>) that they demonstrate to be originated (because they are not devoid of <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> or <i>hawaadith</i>), and this is what their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is reduced to. Because they considered this proof (<i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>) to be the only sound argument to prove Allaah's existence based upon reason, they considered reason (aql) to be the starting point of all theological language and they considered anything that clashed with this reason (aql) to be false and futile. From here stemmed their evil perception towards the revealed texts, that they are expressions of "<i><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></i>" and "<i><a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a></i>" whose apparentness necessitates kufr and shirk, and also from here we see the underlying reason for the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation) of <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions by the <b>Kalam Dynasty</b> of families. It is because they gave preference to the language of a star-worshipping idolator (<a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>) in defining and qualifying speech about Allaah over and above the language of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) which some of them [al-Ghazali (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>), <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (<a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>see here</a>), <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>)] considered to be necessary expressions of language to entice the dumb commoners to retain faith and prevent them from falling into <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a>. Thus, the starting point of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> is that <i>aql</i> (reason) dictates what can and cannot be said of Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted and where there appears to be a conflict between reason and revelation (due to that evil presumption about the revealed texts that pertain to the attributes), it is reason that must prevail and reason must therefore be the judge of what is <u>necessary</u> (<i>waajib</i>), <u>impossible</u> (<i>mumtani'</i>) and <u>permissible</u> (<i>jaa'iz</i>) for Allaah the Exalted. This was later <b>codified</b> and <b>solidified</b> as a firm foundation for the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> by <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) in his book "<i>Asaas al-Taqdis</i>" in the form of the "<b>Universal Principle</b>" (<i>al-Qaanoon al-Kullee</i>), which states that when reason and revelation contradict each other it is reason that must prevail over revelation.    <P>
<b>10. </b> Once that is clear, when <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> defines divinity as that "...<i>which attempts to understand what is <u>necessary</u>, <u>impossible</u> and <u>permissible</u> for God, Most High</i>," then he means on the basis of reason (<i>aql</i>), not on the basis of revelation. In other words, that which is necessary (<i>waajib</i>), impossible (<i>mumtani'</i>) and permissible (<i>jaa'iz</i>) is dictated by the intellect primarily and any conflict between what the intellect dictates and what the revealed text states must be resolved by giving precedence to the intellect and then taking an approach (<i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> or <i>tafweed</i>) towards the revealed text in order to cleanse it of the apparent <i><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></i> so as to remove the conflict. This requires them also to present the verses and texts relating to the attributes as "<i>mutashaabihaat</i>" (ambiguous).  All people with sincerity and academic honesty must know and acknowledge (through undeniable historical fact and record) that this was not the way of the Salaf, rather this was the way condemned by the Salaf and it was the way initiated by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which was later inherited by the Ash'aris and Maturidis. This establishes that <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is leading his students and audience down that condemned path (of the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> condemned by the Salaf) on which they will find dung, blood and puss (leftovers of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> - <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see here</a>), leaving the pure fresh milk they would have found on the other path of the Prophets and Messengers and their followers, the people of Hadeeth, Sunnah and Aathaar.     <P>
<b>11. </b> From the above one can see the clear difference between what <b>the Prophets and Messengers</b> brought and between what the <i>aql</i> (intellect) of a star-worshipping idolater (<a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>) brought to the Hellenized Jews, Christians, <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and to the Ash'aris and Maturidis through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah: <img src=assets/images/aristotle-right.gif align=right style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" border=0> This is the basis of their speech about Divinity, <u>the Ten categories of Aristotle:</u> <b>1) <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</b> referring to all the entities (bodies, beings, things) that make up the universe. Then every one of these bodies has nine incidental attributes through which it is characterized and they are:  <b>2) Quantity (al-kam)</b> - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on. <b>3) Quality (al-kayf)</b> - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on. <b>4) Relation (al-idaafah)</b> - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on. <b>5) Place (al-ayn)</b> - where it is. <b>6) Time (mataa)</b> answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>. <b>7) Position (al-wad')</b> - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other.  <b>8) Action (yaf'al)</b> acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing. <b>9) Affection (yanfa'il)</b> a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon, affected by other than it. <b>10) Having (al-mulk)</b> - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on. <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> identified the "first cause" of the universe through an argument involving motion and rest, and on the basis of this classification of what is observed of bodies in the universe (the ten categories), he ended up with a deity that <i>in short</i> is summarized as "<u>immaterial, unembodied, immutable</u>" and <i>in more detail</i> as follows, as is found in his <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> 12 treatise: "<b><i>The unmoved mover is infinite, since it causes infinite motion. It follows that it is also without magnitude, since an infinite force cannot reside in a finite magnitude (and there can be no infinite magnitudes); having no magnitude means that the first mover is indivisible, having no parts</i></b>", (now you know where the Mutakallimin get their statements such as "God does not occupy space, God does not have spatial extension" and so on). This unmoved mover is, "<b><i>eternal, unmovable and separate from sensible things</i></b>" (meaning cannot be perceived with the senses, and this is what <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought into the Ummah), and he also says, "<b><i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence. The reason that God can have no magnitude is that God produces motion through infinite time, which means that God must be infinite, since an infinite effect requires an infinite cause; but there cannot be such a thing as an infinitude magnitude. As being a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> without magnitude, God is without parts and, therefore, indivisible (magnitudes are divisible)</i></b>", and here in the next statement we see the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, where in <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> 12, we read "<b><i>the primary essence has no matter, which means that there can only be one God, since it is matter that differentiates one form or definition into many manifestations of that one form or definition.  Since God has no matter, then God is one not only formally or in definition, but also numerically</i></b>" and here is something else which is a parallel to the theology of the Mutakallimin, straight from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, "<b><i>It has been shown also that this primary essence cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible. But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of place</i></b>." This last statement alludes to what the Mutakallimin are upon of denying what they call <i>hawaadith</i> for Allaah, the denial of those matters tied to Allaah's will and choice which they call "events" and "changes" but which to Ahl al-Sunnah are Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>), a sign of His utmost perfection. <b>Once this is clear, you will know exactly where the Ash'aris and Maturidis are coming from and where their theology is really derived from. When you speak to them, or they argue with you, you will immediately recognize the mental <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> and intellectual abuse they have suffered in order to speak with you in this manner, thinking they are rightly guided.</b>    <P>
<b>12. </b> This is the deity of <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> and every other <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> in history. For the sake of this were the mechanisms of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> (distortion of the meanings) invented by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <i>tafweed</i> (erasing of the meanings) invented by the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, after having turned to the texts of the attributes and considered them as either expressions of <i><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></i> and <i>kufr</i> if left upon their apparentness or as <i>mutashaabihaat</i> (ambiguous, allegorical). And the deviation of this way from the way of the Prophets, Messengers and their followers is as clear as the daylight sun for anyone who makes an objective study of the history of the second and third centuries hijrah, a place and time that the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> never venture into because they can only start citing their scholarship from the fifth century onwards (after 400H) and alongside all of that, they are in dispute even with <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H), Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (d. 324H) and <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a> (d. 403H) on the issue of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> of Allaah, the Exalted, so even their ascription to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> is to be questioned.     <P>
<b>13. </b> In summary, the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the People of Sunnah and Aathaar as it relates to the Attributes is  "<b>to affirm for Allaah, the Most High, whatever Allaah and His Messenger affirm for Allaah, the Most High, whilst negating <i><a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a></i></b>" and the foundation for this principle is the Book and the Sunnah as they both clearly indicate that this is the correct and true approach to be taken. The <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the people of falsehood is "<b>to deny from Allaah, the Most High, <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> (bodies and accidents)</b>" and the foundation for this approach lies in the <i>aql</i> of a star-worshipping pagan idolator which passed through the uqool (intellects) of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> before it came to the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> in this Ummah. It is on this basis that they "<i>attempt to understand what is <u>necessary</u>, <u>impossible</u> and <u>permissible</u> for God, Most High</i>" and had they taken the path with the Prophets and Messengers, they would have been saved the toil and hassle of this pretentious, antiquated, pseudo-intellectual babble, let alone its evil consequences in the Hereafter.    <P>
