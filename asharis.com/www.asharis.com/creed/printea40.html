<p>The <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> <a href='tags/competition-corner.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Competition Corner</font></a> at <a href=index.html>Asharis.Com</a>, is intended to foster better understanding about the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed and its underlying foundations. This is our third quiz question. If you feel really confident about your <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and want to give it a test, or you are simply looking to "polish up", why not participate? Details of how to do so are after the quiz question.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Imam al-Tahawi (rahimahullaah) is a great and lofty Imaam, and many of the Innovators from Ahl al-Kalam have associated with him and his creed in order to support their ta'til (divestment) and tahrif (distortion) as it pertains to Allah's attributes and actions. In reality, al-Tahawi has rebutted their doctrine, and this is known just by one issue, the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Our language here, which is asking as to whether he was a Mujassim is simply an approach in argument used to tie the noose around the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of today who pretend to be upon his creed - for al-Tahawi is free of them and they of him, however their evil theological basis of ajsaam (bodies) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) which leads them to their statement that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, necessitates they must hold al-Tahawi to be a Mujassim.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Was Imam al-Tahawi a Mujassim?</font>    <P>
Pay very close attention to the following quote from al-Tahawiyyah:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And that the (Arabic) <b><i><u>Qur&#702;&#257;n</u></i></b> is the speech (<b><i><u>kal&#257;m</u></i></b>) of All&#257;h. It originated, arose, commenced from Him - without kaifiyyah - as speech, statement (<b><i><u>qawlan</u></i></b>). He sent it down to His Prophet as revelation (<b><i><u>wa&#7717;iy</u></i></b>) and the believers accepted it as such in reality. And they had firm conviction that it was (indeed) the speech of All&#257;h, the Exalted in reality. It is not created like the speech of the created beings. So whoever <b><i><u>heard it</u></i></b> [the Arabic Qur&#702;&#257;n] and claimed it is the speech of man, has disbelieved. All&#257;h has rebuked him, censured him and promised him His punishment, when He said, "<b>I will roast him in Hellfire</b>" (74:26). Thus, when All&#257;h threatened the one who said, "<b>This is but the speech (qawl) of man</b>" (74:25), we come to know and have firm conviction that it is the speech, statement (<b><u><i>qawl</i></u></b>) of the Creator of humanity, and it does not resemble the speech of man.</blockquote>    <P>
Take note of the following facts:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Fact 1:</b> Al-Tahawi treats the <u><a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a></u>, <u>kalam</u> (speech), <u>qawl</u> (statement), <u>wahi</u> (revelation), <u>masmu'</u> (what is heard) all as the one and same uncreated speech of Allaah and explains that anyone who claims that [the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or kalam, or qawl, or wahi, or what is heard] is created or is the statement (qawl) of man is a kafir.    <P>
<b>Fact 2:</b> Al-Tahawi states (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), he used the verb (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'> &#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) which means commenced, originated, began. In some manuscripts it is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'> &#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>), meaning, arose, emanated, occurred. Upon the view of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> that there are two Qur'ans, a) that which is from the eternal kalam nafsee (an indivisible single eternal meaning present with Allaah), and b) that which is letter and words (the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with us). By using the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'> &#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) which means commenced, originated, began, al-Tahawi states clearly that - upon the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrine - either the kalam nafsee has a beginning and/or the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has a beginning. But, since he has treated the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is heard (the arabic Quran) to be Allah's qawl and kalam and wahi, and treated it all the same, then it means, that he is speaking about both Qur'ans (upon the view of the Ash'arites).</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Now here is the background to the question:</b>    <P>
From the perspective of Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the revealed Books and sent Messengers, Al-Tahawi has simply affirmed that Allah speaks as and when He wills, and that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, as we have it, began with Allah as speech (qawl) - as opposed to beginning with Jibril (alayhis salaam), or Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) as their qawl (speech), alongside the fact that Allaah has always been one who speaks (mutakallim). This is an affirmation of Allah's sifat fi'liyyah or <a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a> (chosen actions), and since Allah in His essence is uncreated and eternal, then whatever names, attributes He possesses and actions He performs, are all uncreated.    <P>
But from the perspective of Ahl al-Kalam - the followers of the  Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers in their proof of huduth al-ajsam and its underlying language and terminology of ajsaam (bodies), jawaahir (substances) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes), used to argue for the origination of the universe, and on the basis of which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> denied the attributes and the As'ariyyah and Maturidiyyah denied Allaah's chosen actions tied to His will and power - al-Tahawi has spoken with plain manifest kufr and hardcore tajsim, since commencement, beginning (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1569;</span>), necessitates huduth (origination), which is only for created bodies and in speaking about Allah's <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and kalam and wahi and qawl in this manner, treating them all as one, al-Tahawi has affirmed Allah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) subject to events (hawadith), which is plain manifest kufr to the Mutakallimin as a whole.    <P>
<b>Which leads us to the question itself:</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Bearing in mind everything which has been stated in the two factual points and the last two paragraphs, please write an essay no shorter than 2000 words in order to argue the case that al-Tahawi was not a Mujassim, meaning write an essay to defend al-Tahawi from the necessary charge of tajsim (leading on from the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of al-jawhar wal-'arad). You must explain his choice of words. You will be marked <u>purely on mental and literary gymnastics</u>, in other words, how well you can stretch, jump, contort, and bend over in trying to absolve al-Tawahi from the necessities that must follow from the theology of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad which you have chosen as the language of your belief regarding Allah which is based upon the proof of huduth al-ajsam  which you took from the Sabean star and  idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers through the route of al-Ja'd bin Dirham to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to yourselves (the Ash'aris). Our panel will be looking for the most breathtaking and cunning displays for later exhibition.</div>    <P>
