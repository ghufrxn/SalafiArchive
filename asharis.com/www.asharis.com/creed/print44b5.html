<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> From the preceding <b>eight articles</b> in this series (you must read them all before reading this or later articles!) the difference should be noted between:    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> <u>What the Salaf warned against</u> which is tashbih and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>. This is after they affirmed all of what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him, without distinguishing between names, attributes and actions. As a result they were accused of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who had incorporated the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> into their theology through the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (origination of bodies). Then they sought to  make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the texts that clashed with this proof.    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> What <u>the very early Kullaabis and very early Ash'aris</u> showed of rejection against the Rafidi and Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> for their <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> (concluding Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> through ilm al-kalaam). However, they themselves received  rejection from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and were accused of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for affirming Allah's 'uluww and sifat dhatiyyah and <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (such as face, hands, eyes). Whilst they indulged in <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, unlike the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they never considered the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> to be obligatory and nor the only way to prove Allaah exists. As a result, they were not forced by necessity of this proof to make <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (rejection, divestment) of matters which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> made <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> What <u>the later Ash'aris</u> and <u>the Maturidis</u> showed of rejection against Rafidi and Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for their <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (that being a purely kalam thing), but they also extended that rejection to Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the Righteous Salaf, after having slandered them with accusations of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> because of their affirmation of what these Innovators believed should be rejected because it clashed with their proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>. These people abandoned the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and lost any substantial  connection to him. They agreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in their views (and considered knowing the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> to be obligatory, and believed this is the only proof and Islam itself depends upon it). As a result the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> receded into the negation of their brethren in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-kalam</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. By these new standards <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (even <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and others) would be considered <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>. You can take a look at <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>this example here</a> at how <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> defended against this slander of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> for his affirmation of the  <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
With these distinctions <u>proven as historical realities</u> (all are documented extensively in other articles on the site), it sets the scene for us to analyze the allegations of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih which are always circulated <u>as fodder</u> by the pseudo-Ash'ari swindlers on the various forums, blogs and websites as a means <u>to rope in more sheep into the pen</u></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Why The <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> Are A Target for the Pseudo-<a href="tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a></font>    <P>
There is an impetus and motivation for the "<a href="tags/hanbalis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hanbalis</font></a>" to be made the subject of attack by the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologists (who are wholly represented by the pseudo-Ash'aris and Maturidis today) and this is because the pseudo-Ash'aris are closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> than they are to Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself (who adopted the aqidah of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> at the end of his life). Whilst this requires an article in an of itself, some explanation is needed here to provide the bigger picture as to why the "<a href="tags/hanbalis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hanbalis</font></a>" must be maligned in front of an unsuspecting audience.     <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> There is no doubt that Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal represented the Sunnah, meaning, what all the Salaf were upon from the Companions through to Imaam Ahmad's teachers, in the matters of creed. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> inherited all of that and the statement returned back to him - as in the statement of what is truth and falsehood - in the context of the groups of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>. The leadership for the people of the Sunnah went to  him, represented in the tribulation in the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> represented the creed of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Maalik, Shaaf'iee and all the other great Imaams of the religion. He is in fact the flagbearer of the hadeeth, sunnah, aathar and of <b>the Salafi creed</b> and methodology - in <u>direct conflict</u> with the people of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, those who took to speaking about Allaah upon what they inherited and borrowed from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of speech based on bodies and accidents (<i>ajsaam, a'raad</i>). Read <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a></b> for an exposition of this matter.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> We have to be aware of a layer of confusion in that the label "<b>Hanbali</b>" refers to <u>a fiqh school</u>, just like the labels Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i refer to fiqh schools and not creeds. By referring to a creed as "Hanbali" it conceals certain historical facts, such as the one mentioned in the first point above and such as the fact that <u>all Shafi'ee and Hanbali scholars</u> in that era were united upon a single creed. One can simply look at the likes of Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l al-Muzan&#299; (d. 264H), Im&#257;m al-D&#257;rim&#299; (d. 280H), Ibn Surayj al-Sh&#257;fi&#703;&#299; (d. 306H), Ibn Jar&#299;r al-&#7788;abar&#299; (d. 310H), <a href='tags/ibn-khuzaymah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Khuzaymah</font></a> (d. 311H), Abu Bakr al-&#256;jurr&#299; (d. 360H), by way of example only, to see that their creed is but that of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, whilst they are all Shafi'i scholars. This exposes the hoax of today's pseudo-Ash'arites who try to isolate the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> at large. <b>Indeed, it is not possible for anyone to be upon the aqidah of the Salaf, except that he must be upon the aqidah of Imaam Ahmad</b>. The point here is that there is <u>a Salafi creed</u>, and it was held onto by <u>Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis</u>. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a> saved this Salafi creed by Allaah's aid from the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups, those wishing to impose upon the Ummah the creed based upon the conceptual tools of previous nations, the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik and Shafi'ee all despised the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad). <u>So we have to get beneath the labels here</u>, and make sure we use the right ones. There is <b>a Salafi creed</b> and there are different approaches in fiqh. Different approaches in fiqh can co-exist with the Salafi creed. And if you look at the scores of works written by those upon the Salafi creed between the second and fourth centuries, you will see Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is and <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> all upon a single aqidah, opposed to the heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups who were throughout this period insignificant, despised and downtrodden.    <P>
<b>Third:</b> Upon the above point, we say that there are the followers of the Salafi aqidah following <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> in fiqh, followers of the Salafi aqidah following Malik in fiqh, followers of the Salafi aqidah following Shafi'ee in fiqh, followers of Salafi aqidah following <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a> in fiqh - all of this was present by the turn of the fourth century (after 300H). However, having said what has been said in point two, putting aside the aberrations of a handful of <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, there is no  doubt that the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf, was carried through the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, and in a way "Hanbalism" (as in the creed, not the fiqh school) was nothing but the transmission of the aqidah of the Companions and Tabi'een.    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> Amongst all of the followers of each of these four schools in fiqh there were those who deviated from the Salafi aqidah of each of those Imaams. For example, amongst the Hanafis there were Mu'tazilis, Jahmis, Raafidees, Qadaris and so on. That this should happen is not strange, and just like there are people (such as the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Baatiniyyah) ascribing to the Prophets of  Allaah whilst they (the Prophets) are free of them, likewise there are those who ascribe to the Imaams whilst those Imaams are free of those people, <u>or at least free of their sayings and opinions in creed</u>. However, one fact that must be noted here is that the followers of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, whilst some of them did depart from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, <b>the misguidance amongst the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> is <u>dwarfed</u> compared to the misguidance found amongst the other schools</b>. If you look in all other schools, you see tajahhum, i'tizaal, tashayyu', jabar, rejection of khabar al-waahid, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (Hanafi Karraamiyyah), tasbeeh (Shafi'ee Kurds), wahdat al-wujood (the grossest of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and tashbeeh)  and so on. The followers of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in general are the safest from error walhamdulillaah, and this is by virtue of their closeness to the hadeeth, sunnah and aathaar, a legacy of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> himself.     <P>
<b>Five:</b> Historically, the enmity was between the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and this enmity has played on through to this day. The real resentment of these people is actually towards <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (representing the light of revelation, hadith, sunnah and aathaar) and his victory against the brethren of the pseudo-Ash'aris and Maturidis, who are the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. This is because they all share in the foundational principles upon which their entire theology rests, that of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> and of its main premise, "<i>Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith (events), is itself <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated)</i>." So Imaam Ahmad's defeat against them was <u>a victory for the naql over the 'aql</u> (the naql of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah against the 'aql of Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> which the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups were upon - <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>). Hence, whilst <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is not directly, attacked, the "<a href="tags/hanbalis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hanbalis</font></a>" are attacked as a whole on account of the errors and mistakes of a handful amongst them, and this is for a specific purpose.    <P>
<b>Six:</b> Operating from the background of enmity towards the people of the Sunnah and aathaar, the pseudo-Ash'aris of today leave <u>the forests and logs</u> found with others (Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is), and turn to the twigs they found with some of the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, meaning, mistakes they fell into. Then they exaggerate them beyond all bounds, falsifying or distorting history, and making it appear as if there was no misguidance greater than what happened to some of those <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>. <b>The reality is that what these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> fell into is miniscule and insignificant, and if we affirm their mistakes, they are only restricted to no more than a handful of people, some of whom have also been slandered oppressively, such as al-Qaadee Abu Ya'laa</b>. But the aim of these people is to keep the microscope on these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> so you are not able to see what is with others of much greater misguidance and heresy. This is part of the pseudo-Ash'ari swindle today and you will see these academic fraudsters and shysters, when they wish to call to their own <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> school, they will begin by teaching gullible and naive students about the errors these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> fell into (albeit through a Jahmee, I'tizaalee perspective), often relying on the book of Ibn al-Jawzee <i>Daf' Shubah al-Tashbih</i> as a primer. The <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creeds cannot stand on their own, because <u>the people's fitrah is averse to them</u> (see <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> admit it openly <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a>, <a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>here</a> and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>here</a>). Hence, they must do some "softening" upon the people first, unsettle them, scaremonger them.  </blockquote>     <P>

<blockquote>Ibn Asaakir mentions in <a href='tags/al-tabyin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tabyin</font></a> (p. 262) how they used to secretively study with Ibn al-Labaan until once they happened to arrive on the same occasion, realizing that each was taking from this <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar. So they both agreed to keep this quiet. Ibn al-Labaan was a student of al-Baqillaani. <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> also used to attend the gathering of Abu Ja'far al-Simnani <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (see al-Tabaqaat 3/386), and he was another student of al-Baqillaani. Hence, <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> was affected by the usool of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> (through these Ash'arites), as was Rizqullaah al-Tamimi, who was even more affected and he used to also deny the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. Rizqullaah is the son of Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi who used to be associates with <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>. So what is happening here is that these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> were affected to different degrees, and <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in particular fell into something of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and it came through in his views on Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>), the speech of Allaah, the Qur'aan, and Allaah's 'uluww and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, and also returning the attributes of anger, pleasure and love to iraadah (wish). </blockquote>    <P>
You will find much in the speech of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> which is from the language of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and it can also be found in the speech of his son Ibn Abee Ya'laa, and very often Abu Ya'laa's views are similar to those of al-Baqillaani, a prime example is that of al-Muwaafaat, the doctrine that states that <a href='tags/allaahs-anger.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Anger</font></a> and pleasure are eternal and relate only to an individual on the basis of what he will die upon. This doctrine was innovated in order not to affirm a wish and will for Allaah, such that Allaah loves, becomes angry and becomes pleased if and when He so wishes. It should be noted that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> authored a work in refutation of his former <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> teacher, Ibn al-Labaan called <i>al-Radd alaa Ibn al-Labaan</i> (see al-Tabaqat 3/384), however since we do not have this book with us today, it is not known on what issues this refutation was centered around.    <P>
From the kalam views held by <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> (which he later turned away from) include: the first obligation being al-nadhar wal-istidlaal with a view to proving Allaah's existence, holding the validity of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, falling into <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed (often falling into contradiction), negation of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (Allaah's chosen actions) and taking the approaches of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> towards them, speaking with the specific negations of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> such as negating <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, hadd, <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> and the likes. Al-Qadi turned away from most of this, but despite that aspects of the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> can still be found in what is transmitted from him.    <P>

Despite engaging with these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and adopting some of their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> views, al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> nevertheless opposed the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah and authored a work <i>Ibtaal <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> al-Sifaat</i> around the year 429H in order to refute <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 403H) who had written a work <i>Mushkil al-Hadith</i> in which he proceeded to make systematic <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of texts that "give the presumption of tajseem" as he claimed, upon the belief that <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is a foundation of the Islamic creed and is part and parcel of "<a href="tags/tawhid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tawhid</font></a>", meaning here the "<a href="tags/tawhid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tawhid</font></a>" of the Mutakallimin, which after employing the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> requires by necessity that the revealed texts be "doctored" so as not to clash with this proof.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> was aiming to defend the Sunnah and you have to remember that, by this time, the <u>mid-fifth-century</u>, these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> had <u>abandoned</u> affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, <u>opposing both <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Ash'ari</u>, and they considered affirmation of those attributes to be <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. Ironically, it was <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who were accused by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of being Mujjassimah for affirming those very same attributes(!!)     <P>
<b>By the way this just shows you which planet, <u>nay galaxy</u>, today's pseudo-Asharis are upon who think they are following  Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari(!) - see <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> refute the allegation of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>in this article</a></b>.     <P>
So al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> wrote this book and within it he brought what all the Imaams of the Salaf brought in their refutations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> from the akhbaar (reports) which are graded sahih and met with acceptance by the Ummah. So Rizqullaah al-Tamimi scorned him for this because Rizqullaah al-Tamimi was upon the way of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in denying these <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah. </div>    <P>
However, what aided al-Tamimi (and later on, others like Ibn al-Jawzee) in this scorn is that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> included weak and fabricated narrations pertaining to the attributes which make mention of things that Allaah is not described with. His enemies also fabricated things upon him which he was innocent of and this opened up the door for his name to be tainted and tarnished and the accusations of tashbih to be mobilized against him.    <P>
Al-Dhahabi mentions in al-Siyar (18/90):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He compiled the book <i>Ibtal <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> al-Sifaat</i> and so they stood against  him on account of what it contained of weak and fabricated narrations ... and the book <i>Ibtaal al-Ta'weel</i> was carried to al-Qadir Billaah (the ruler) and it amazed him, and many affairs and tribulations occurred, we ask Allaah for safety. Then the minister, Alee bin al-Muslimah rectified between the two parties (Ash'arites and al-Qaadee and his followers), and he announced openly, "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah and the reports pertaining to the attributes are to be passed on just as they have come</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
And Ibn Abee Ya'laa mentions in Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah (3/372):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And [my] father, the pleased one, attended the gathering of Abu al-Qaasim Alee bin al-Hasan, the chief of the chiefs in the year 445H, in the Dar al-Khilafah, and there was a large gathering present with him, and a great number of the shaykhs of the jurists, and many from the people of the religion and the world. So the chief of the chiefs said on that day in front of all of the people, "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allah, and the reports pertaining to the attributes are to be passed on just as the have come</i>" and he rectified between the two groups.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that the tribulation that occurred here was that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> by this time had already receded into <u>the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah</u>, since they no longer affirmed what <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (and likewise al-Baqillani) affirmed, and began to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of it. So when al-Qadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, after first being influenced by these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (in certain areas), left part of that influence (resorting to ta'weel) and authored in refutation of their approach of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> towards the reports pertaining to the attributes, they accused him of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> for affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah. The weak and fabrication narrations were not really the issue but they were something that made matters worse for <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in the situation itself, and he was criticized for that by both the people of the Sunnah and his opponents who only saw it as more fuel for their fire. In the above narration of <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a>, the minister Alee bin al-Muslimah who arbitrated, and the chief Ali bin al-Hasan (in the narration of Ibn Abee Ya'laa), supported <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> by stating that the attributes are to be left as they are (i.e. <u>without ta'weel</u>) and passed on as they have come. This was a victory for <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> against the detractors. The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and those affected by them condemned <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> because he related the texts of the attributes <u>without ta'weel</u>, he was arguing for this as a methodology and corroborating this was the way of the Salaf. This was the fundamental matter, since all of the offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <u>consider it obligatory</u> to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of those texts so as to keep in conformity with the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>.    <P>

From the oppressive slanders against <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> is what was cited by Abu Bakr bin al-Arabi (a student of al-Ghazali) in his book <i>al-Awaasim min al-Qawaasim</i> through <u>an unnamed source</u> that:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Abu Ya'laa Muhammad bin al-Husain al-Faraa', the chief of the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> in Baghdad used to say, when he mentioned Allah, the Exalted, and what is reported from these dhawaahir (plain, obvious meanings) regarding His attributes, the Exalted, he said: "Impose upon me whatever you wish (of attributes) for indeed I adhere to its affirmation, save the beard and the private parts."</blockquote>    <P>
This is a pure fabrication and slander, and this is in fact the saying of Dawud al-Jawaaribee, the Raafidee Mujassim, Mushabbih, and not the saying of al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (see his entry <a href=index8ba5.html?uhzra>in this article</a>).

This fabrication against <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> is the basis of the slander of many of those who came after such as al-Kawthari and his likes and this will be on their shoulders on the Day of Judgement when they will have to contend on this matter.    <P>

Abu Ya'laa has a Kullaabi <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> taint on his aqidah due to having spent time with the As'harites of Baghdad, and thus the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is readily apparent in some of his works when he writes on matters of creed. In fact, the same shows through in his son, Ibn Abee Ya'laa, who was no doubt influenced by his father in this regard. This influence was particular in the issue of the <a href='tags/sifat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (Allaah's chosen actions) which are rejected by the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups because they imply "hawaadith" (events, occurrences). As for the <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a>, khabariyyah, then al-Qadi took the way of Ahl al-Sunnah and he rejected <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (after first being influenced in that regard). This is why scorn was scorn against him.    <P>
However, al-Qadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> also refuted the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and he actually has two works in that regard, "<i>al-Radd alaa al-Karraamiyyah</i>" and also "<i>al-Radd alaa al-Mujassimah</i>".  He also wrote "<i>al-Radd alaa al-Ash'ariyyah</i>" and "<i>al-Radd alaa al-Baatiniyyah</i>". (See <i>al- Tabaqaat</i> of his son Ibn Abee Ya'laa, 3/383). To give you an idea of this mingling between his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> influence and his affirmation of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah and his rejection of tasbheeh and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, look at this statement of his creed related by his son Ibn Abee Ya'laa in <i>Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah</i> (3/392):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the pleased father (radiallaahu anhu) had said regarding the reports pertaining to the attributes: <blockquote>The madhhab regarding that is the acceptance of these ahaadeeth upon what they have come with without turning away from that to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> which opposes its apparentness, whilst believing that Allaah, the Sublime, is different to every thing besides Him, and everything that occurs in the imagination of a definition (hadd) or of resemblance (<a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>) or <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, then Allaa is Sublime and Exalted from that, and there is no likeness unto Allaah, and He is not to be described with those attributes of creation which are indicative of their origination, and it is not permitted upon Him what is permitted upon them of change (taghayyur) from one state to another, He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) nor a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), nor an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (incidental attribute), and that He never ceased to exist and will never cease to exist and that He is the one who cannot be imagined in the minds, and His attributes do not resemble the attributes of the creation, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b>."

And he (may Allah's mercy be upon him) mentioned  words, the meaning of which is that tashbih is only binding upon the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> if one of two matters was found amongst them, that either they were the ones to initiate an attribute for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and invent it, or they explicitly stated belief in tashbih regarding the ahaadeeth which they were transmitting. But as for the one who brought the Sharee'ah being the one who initiated these ahaadeeth and His speech (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is a proof (hujjah) by which whatever opposes it is invalidated, and they (the Hanbalis) are simply following him. And further, the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> have explicitly stated that they believe in affirmation of the attributes, and negating <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, then how can it be permissible to ascribe to them that in whose very negation they believe? </blockquote>    <P>

<b>The second:</b> The clear <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> influence upon <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in that he spoke with innovated negations (such as negating <i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>, <i><a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a></i>, <i><a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a></i>) and likewise negating Allaah's chosen actions by negating from Allaah "<i>change from one state to another</i>" and what is meant by them is Allaah's chosen actions (such as Allaah making <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, and becoming angry, pleased and the likes). This is what he took from the likes of Ibn al-Labaan and al-Simnani, from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
<b>The third:</b> His clear rejection of tashbih and that affirmation of the attributes - which is the way of the Salaf as a whole and not just of those <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> - does not imply <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. This is no doubt the truth and it is what is reported from the likes of <b>Nu'aym bin Hammaad</b>, <b>Ishaaq bin Raayhuyah</b> and <b>Imaam al-Tirmidhee</b> (who were refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this very same matter two centuries earlier - <a href=indexdf36.html?icwge>see here</a>).</blockquote>    <P>
We could bring many more quotes to indicate the reality of the creed of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and his son, but we will suffice with one more from his son in his book <i>al-I'tiqaad</i>. In the opening pages he brings all the usual issues of belief based upon the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the authentic reports related to the reality of faith, then Allaah's attribute of speech, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then he mentions that Allaah is living with life, knowing with knowledge, powerful with power, hearing with hearing, seeing with sight, speaking with speech, wishing with wish, and then he affirms Allaah created Adam with His hands, and then affirms a face for Allaah, and likewise that Allaah will place His foot in the Hellfire, and that Allaah descends to the lowest heaven, and that Allaah laughs at two men one of whom kills the other and yet they both enter Paradise, and Allaah rejoicing at the repentance of His servant, and what is similar to these types of reports which all of the Salaf affirmed without rejection and without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>. Then he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Resembling Allaah to His creation is disbelief. If he believes a belief in these attributes and their likes from what is reported in the authentic reports comprising resemblance (<a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>) in terms of body, and type and shape, and length - then He is a kaafir. Denial of the attributes is the madhhab of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. And if he interpreted them upon the requirements of the language or upon metaphor (majaaz), then he is a Jahmee. The Methodology of the Ahl al-Sunnah regarding the Attributes. And if he passed them on as they have come without <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, and without tafseer, and without <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and nor <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, just as the Sahaabah and the Taabi'un did, then that is obligatory upon him.</blockquote>    <P>
Refer to his book <i>al-I'tiqaad</i> (pp. 11-66, tahqeeq Muhammad al-Khamees). Again you can see aspects of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creeping through into the type of language used here, particularly in negation, but the major thing is that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and his son Abee Ya'laa, just like the Imaams of Hadeeth and Sunnah before them saw the methodology of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> towards the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> to be from the way of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. And this was the conflict between them and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who supported the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah, after jumping off the train of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> [who affirmed these attributes and were labelled as <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah], and these later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> attacked <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> for not agreeing with them more than what he already had done, rather, for disagreeing with them and writing in opposition to their way of considering <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> to be an obligation (in order to defend the proof of huduth al-ajsaam).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> is to Be Criticized For</font>    <P>
Two parties criticized <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>.     <P>
<blockquote>Those from <b>Ahl al-Sunnah</b> who criticized him for the use of weak and fabricated narrations for affirming some attributes which are not related in the Book and the Sunnah. They did not accuse him of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. As <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> mentioned that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> did not have the expertise in these areas of separating the weak from the authentic that the earlier Imaams did (<a href=index037e.html?fsxrr>see this article</a> on the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who erred for details). So he is criticized from this angle.    <P>
Those from the <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b> from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who considered <u>affirmation of any of the sifat khabariyyah</u> (leaving aside weak and fabricated narrations) to be tashbih - following in the footsteps of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - and so they criticized <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> for that, and they were given support in that through the fact that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> included weak and fabricated narrations, even if that was a side issue which gave them support. If he had not included these narrations the accusation of tashbih would still have been made. This is because all Ash'aris from the middle of the fifth century (with the exception of al-Bayhaqi) rejected the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> such as face, hands, eye(s), and considered their affirmation to be <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. And since Ahl al-Sunnah affirm all of the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, let alone the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> and the entirety of the Salaf, should be accused of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> is certainly not unexpected. </blockquote>    <P>
So there is a truthful criticism and a baseless criticism which is actually slander. Further, these unscrupulous <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the common riff-raff amongst their followers would also fabricate or transmit lies against the likes of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>. <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> said at the end of his book <i>Ibtaal al-Ta'weelaat</i>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that when I completed this book of mine and it was read to some of the leaders of Khurasaan in the abode of the Sultan, this became very severe upon the opposers, and they made much distortion, lying, false-witness and fabrication in what they narrated from me, and they added things to my book seeking condemnations (against it) and to make the rulers and the common folk to become averse (towards it). And they said, "He has mentioned in it [the book]: Chapter on the Male Private Parts, and al-Qafhah, and the Beard, and the Head and al-Masrabah and the Hair and the Sandal and Riding upon a Donkey, and Walking in the Markets, and that He created Himself from the perspiration of horses and other than that of lying, falsehood and fabrication from what I did not preserve such that I should quote it... And Allaah the Exalted is the reckoner of every oppressor.</blockquote>    <P>
So it is apparent many lies were circulated about him. However, even if he was oppressed and slandered by that which he was free and innocent of, he made commentary on certain fabricated and weak narrations that affirm things which Allaah is free of (in the book <i>Ibtaal al-Ta'weelaat</i>) and in this he is certainly refuted for that as is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah to reject error from whomever it comes. However, the intent of the offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is really to malign the pure "Hanbali" creed which is nothing but the Salafi creed and to turn people away from it and to make them turn instead to what they believe is the true and real Tawheed, that of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad and the presumption of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> for the revealed texts and the absolutely binding obligation of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (meaning, tahreef) of the texts.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Was <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> a Mujassim and Mushabbih?</font>    <P>
We are now in a position to answer this allegation, and the answer is that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> is free and exonerated and innocent of these charges and particularly the slander that was conveyed by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi against him, ascribing to him the saying which is that of the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> such as Dawud al-Jawaaribee, and Allaah is the reckoner of every oppressive slanderer, fabricator and liar who did not abide by justice.     <P>
<blockquote>As for <u><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></u>, then <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> wrote a refutation of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, those who concluded through <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, that Allaah must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>. So he is free from the charge of being from the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, in this respect, we see him using the language of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in explicitly rejecting "<a href="tags/jismiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jismiyyah</font></a>" from Allaah. Hence, he cannot be a Mujassim. As for <u>tashbih</u>, then he is free and innocent of what the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> fell into of claiming their lord is a human of blood and flesh and as a result described Him by fabricating their own descriptions from their ownselves, claiming that He has hair, and lips, and a heart and so on. <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> rejected this and was certainly not upon this, since this tashbih is treating the essence of the Lord to be like the essence of a human, and then describing Him with what is unique to the essences of humans. Likewise, <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> also rejected that any of the attributes of Allaah resemble those of the creation, and this is replete in his writings and what is cited about him from his son. So on this account he is free of tashbih as well.</blockquote>    <P>
Whilst <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> vehemently opposed <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih he erred purely from the angle of affirmation of weak and baseless narrations, thinking them to be authentic, and speaking on the basis of them.  His real crime to those <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> was that like the Salaf and the Imaams of Hadeeth before him, he affirmed the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> <u>without ta'weel</u> and authored in laying this down as the true methodology. However he slipped, due to not having that expertise in separating the authentic from the weak, and this slip cost him and harmed him. It is from justice, that the true reality and nature of his error be pointed out, and it is from oppression and slander that he be accused with that which he is free and innocent of.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for Ibn al-Jawzee and his book <i>Daf' Shabah al-Tashbih</i> in refutation of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and Ibn Haamid (who fell into exaggeration) and likewise Ibn al-Zaghuni (also affected by <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and Kullaabi principles), then it contains some truth with much baatil (falsehood). This is because Ibn al-Jawzee was himself confused on the issue of the attributes and  he had a Jahmee, I'tizaalee slant, and his rebuke of these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> was from that perspective. Thus not everything is accepted from him. It is just like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> accused the Imaams of Hadeeth of being <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for affirming the akhbaar (reports) of the attributes. However, this does not mean that <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and Ibn Haamid did not merit criticism. With respect to <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in particular the true nature of any valid criticism should be clear from this article. With respect to Ibn Haamid then he exaggerated and added to affirmation that which is not from it and he also brought some disrepute into the Hanbali madhhab. But as we said before, these are just a handful of individuals who erred, but the errors found amongst the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> is miniscule compared to the repugnance and evil found amongst those ascribing to the other three Imaams. </div>    <P>
It is also clear that all this commotion and so called controversy is nothing but the making and stirring of these <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who just like their forerunners, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, accused anyone who affirmed the reports <u>without ta'weel</u> as being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, Hashawiyyah. Weak and fabricated narrations or no weak and fabricated narrations - that is wholly irrelevant - the real issue is that al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, despite falling into the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in some areas, actually opposed and refuted their claim of the obligation of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the reports and this is why they sought to attack him, as did some of his fellow <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> like Rizqullaah al-Tamimi who had entered further into the snares of those <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> than <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> himself had entered into their snares.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion</font>    <P>
With the truth made clear on this matter, another pillar and support of the pseudo-Ash'ari swindle, hoax and con-job is demolished and all of these games they play are really false props, they are just mirages by which they confuse the gullible, by distorting history, or confusing it, or mixing affairs and clothing truth with falsehood and presenting a picture other than what it really is. You have to remember the bigger picture here which is that their own aqidah, their own creed, which is:    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, nor a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, nor an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, he is not above, nor below, nor to the right, nor to the left, nor before, nor behind, He is not within the universe, nor outside of it. He is not direction, nor a place, nor in spatial occupation. He is not a form, or shape, or flesh, or bones, or blood. He does not have color, or taste, or smell, and nor hotness or coldness, or motion or rest, or combination or separation, or wetness or dryness. He does not have parts, and does not have a where, or a when....</blockquote>    <P>
These people know that this language <b>[which you will find straight out of the standard Greek books on philosophy and the writings of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans]</b> is something that the people's fitrah <u>simply will not accept</u>. For this reason they cannot start out from this looney-bin as every person with uncorrupted fitrah will look at them as if they had just escaped from St. Lukes Mental Hospital. There's plenty of them lurking on the various blogs, forums and websites, be warned! And these people know this reality for sure (take a look <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>here</a>, <a href=index09b1.html?yiwxz>here</a> and <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>here</a> to see <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and his likes admit it openly). So knowing this, these pseudo-Ash'arites of today have to devise strategies and use cunning in order to find ways to make their creed palatable and acceptable. Hence, a major part of their <u>primary activity</u> in the overall polemic for their call and their creed is to push these slanderous accusations of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in the faces of the people, to mix truth with falsehood, to obfuscate matters, to conceal, twist, exaggerate, decontextualize (like they do with quotes from al-Darimi and Ibn Taymiyyah) and so on, so they can maintain this false illusion and through which they can siphon off people towards the loony-bin of <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>, because after this treatment, this looney-bin does not appear too bad after all and its people  are just normal ... <i>not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not inside the universe, not outside the universe</i>...    <P>
