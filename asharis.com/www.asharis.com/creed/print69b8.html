<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Use of "Eye" or "Two Eyes"</font>    <P>
These individuals used the verification and printed version of Dr. Fayqiyyah Hussain Mahmood (from four manuscripts) as a basis to evaluate other print versions, which they claim are tampered with, because other versions mention eye in the dual form whereas Ibn Asakir and the manuscripts used by Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> use only the singular.    <P>
Well take a look at this page here from Dr. Fawqiyyah's print of al-Ibanah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ashari-ibanah-fawqiyah-sifa.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Surely, they weren't ignorant of it. Read the title at the very top:    <P>
<b>Speech regarding the Face, Two Eyes, Sight and Two Hands</b>    <P>
This title is the same in  every single manuscript and it is the same in all the print versions that of Bashir Uyun (p. 104), that of Salih al-Aseemee (p. 459), and in the manuscripts used by Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> (p. 130)!!    <P>
<img src=assets/images/clown.gif align=right hspace=8 border=0> This exposes that they are just like G.F. Haddad whose example of deception, lying and treachery in quoting they are following. They rely upon the ignorance of people and the fact that most people will not bother to follow up their lies and distortions.    <P>
Then to drive the stake strongly and firmly into this doubt once and for all just take a look at Dr. Fawqiyyah's footnote at the bottom and it will reveal something amazing to you.    <P>
She says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In the margin of [manuscript letter] "seen" in front of the title of the chapter is a comment whose text is,     <P>
<blockquote>Pause over this chapter, for the author has taken liberties in bringing these expressions, they explicitly indicate directions (jihaat) and <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (bodily form) by inclusion (dimniyyan), so reflect</blockquote>    <P>
And this indicates that this reader was a Mu'tazili.</blockquote>    <P>
Here speech indicates that some of these manuscripts were in the possession of those inclined towards I'tizal and this opens the possiblity that the tampering with al-Ibaanah is likely to have come from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who added explanatory statements not said by al-Ashari in order to take his statements towards ta'til and what they consider tanzih. This is plausible considering that historically the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the time of Ibn Darbas al-Shafi'i (d. 659H)  resented the book <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> and tried to discredit it. However, what is also possible and plausible is that this tampering with additional notes actually came from the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, especially considering that these additions all come in the same manuscript labelled (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) and which has no name of the script writer or date of the script, and is different to the three other scripts (stated by Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> in her introduction).    <P>
Then on the very next page, we see that al-Ashari, after using eyes in the dual form in the chapter title, uses it in the single form in the chapter content itself:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ashari-ibanah-fawqiyah-sif2.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Look at the first line at the top, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So He the Exalted informed that He has a face, an eye without takyif and without defining [how].</blockquote>    <P>
So we can see that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself -  in that in which there is no variation amongst all the manuscripts and published versions - has used both "two eyes" and "eye" and therefore, to claim that the variation in the  manuscripts in some places  in relation to mention of eye in the singular is indicataive of adulteration and forgery is a ridiculous and spurious claim.   <P>
