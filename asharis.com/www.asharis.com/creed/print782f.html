<div class='sidebar'>  <blockquote>By the grace of Allaah, Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, who adhere to the Righteous Salaf of the first three centuries in their aqidah and manhaj are not unwise - walhamdulillaah - to those who pose as Ahl al-Sunnah whilst deceiving the Muslims <u>about history</u> and about the creed of the Righteous Salaf,  trying to undermine what is established in the fitrah of mankind that Allaah is above His creation. This is a matter which after leaving aside the Imaams of the Salaf, is affirmed even by the likes of <b>Ibn Kullaab, al-Harith al-Muhasibee, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a>, al-Baqillani</b> (and others from the early Kullabiyyaah and Ash'ariyyah) - all documented and established elsewhere on this website. This is in stark opposition to those who came after and turned instead to the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, abandoning the way of those early Kullabis and Ash'aris.     <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/atabek-jahmi-uluww.gif width=435 border=0></div>    <P>
This individual - who is <u>a Maturidi</u> in aqidah - has made his way to the North of England and alleged in his biographical account is the following:    <P>
<blockquote>Sheikh <a href='tags/atabek-shukrov-nasafi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atabek Shukrov Nasafi</font></a> is a noted scholar and specialist in Islamic aqeeda and theological sciences. Undertaking his religious studies at first in secret in Uzbekistan while it was part of the USSR, he has gone on to have an eclectic and comprehensive Islamic education all over the Muslim world. Already a scholar when he arrived in the Middle East, he studied in Damascus under such luminaries as Mhmd Adnan Darwish, graduating finally from Al Azhar but only after having studied both in Medina and the wider region, for example under Sh. Uthaymeen (and numerous others).</blockquote>    <P>
In this series we shall start deconstructing his academic frauds, distortion of history and lies against the Book of Allaah in a lecture he gave regarding "Where is Allaah?" and it will become clear by Allaah's permission that all we have here is just another <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> peddling a worn-out, outdated aqidah taken from the refuse of previous nations who had meddled in that same <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> before it entered into the Muslim Ummah, describing Allaah as "<i>not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> </i>..." upon the "negative theology" of the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their likes.    <P>
See the series "<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>" (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>here</a>) for an in-depth discussion of the real origin of "<a href="tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>" that entered the Muslim nation in the second century hijrah.    <P>
<b>NOTE:</b> The informed reader will already recognize the falsehood of this man through the abundant articles already present on this website that deal with this same issue. Also worthy of noting here is the use of the name of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, this is deception and is used to deceive his audience into perceiving him in a way that is other than the reality he is trying to hide.    <P>
In his lecture Shukrov has focused on the hadeeth of Mu'awiyah bin al-Hakam and the freeing of a slave-girl (related by Imaam  Muslim in his Saheeh), and he has followed a particular known strategy to deceive the audience, that we shall highlight in the articles to follow inshaa'Allaah. He has regurgitated the arguments of <b>Hasan Ali Saqqaaf</b> against the authenticity of the hadeeth.   </blockquote>    <P>

<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Atabek Shukrov Has No Right To Delve Into the Discussion of The Isnaad Nor To Question the Status of Hilaal bin Abi Maymunah Who is a Narrator Used by Both al-Bukhari and Muslim - Rather He is Obligated to Explain to the World Why His Language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> Is Taken from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> Bin Nicomachus Which is the Real Reason He Is Attempting to Invalidate the Sunnah Which Clashes With His Personal Desires</font>    <P>
<blockquote>There is an important point that Ahl al-Sunnah should note about the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who founded their deen upon <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>, which is that these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> will focus on a matter of <b><u>micro-detail</u></b> so as to hide the <b><u>macro-picture</u></b>. We have alluded to this matter previously and explained this in another article using a similar case example where another <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> was exposed for the very same:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Jahmite Intellectual Fraudster Abu Layth bin 'Ataa of Seeking Ilm:</b> Regarding The Saying of <a href='tags/imam-malik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imam Malik</font></a> on Allah Being Above the Heaven - (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
It is crucial for you to read that article because it explains the matter well, and it is the same thing that Atabek Shukrov is attempting here, following other <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> such as Hassan Ali Saqqaaf and <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a>.    <P>
Essentially, what they will do is to focus on matters of minute detail, such as an isnaad (chain of narration), or the status of a particular narrator - matters whose discussion requires intricate knowledge and access to resources - something not accessible to the average person. By starting off in this way, they assume legitimacy and if anyone engages with them in the debate and discussion surrounding these issues, then that person has given them legitimacy  in speaking about this matter (i.e. discussing the intricacies of a chain of narration or a narrator). However, in reality, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> do not have the right to be discussing these mattters - <b>because there is a greater, <u>more fundamental matter</u> which they have to resolve and explain first.</b> And that is:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Explain to us why you abandoned the language of the Book and the Sunnah and of the Companions and Tabi'een - the language of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers (affirmation without asking how) - and instead  founded your speech about Allaah upon the language and conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, that of bodies (ajsaam, jawaahir), accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) leading to your theology (negation concealed or dressed up as <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed). Provide us with the legislative proof that allows you to build your theology upon the language and conceptual baggage of the Hellenized  Jews, Christians and  <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> all of whom were likewise affected with the conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see here</a>) and which led them to deviation in speech about Allaah's attributes, using language identical to yours and to that of every other <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> for the past 13 centuries. You have no right to discuss any other matter until and unless you clarify this issue.</b></blockquote>    <P>
These people have no legitimacy in questioning and undermining texts which mention the <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (exaltedness of Allaah with His essence) because it is apparent that they are only motivated to question these texts and cast doubts upon them because their theology is founded upon the intellect, conceptual baggage and terminology of a star-worshipping idolater named <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and all of their rhetoric regarding place (makaan) and direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>) is taken from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (<a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>see here</a>). The Companions knew nothing of of this language, and nor did any of these false necessities arise in their minds (i.e. <i>direction necessitates place and place necessitates embodiment</i>).      <P>
Rather, these necessities only apply if you first made analogy for Allaah with His creation and include Allaah within the genus of all things about which if it is said "above" it necessitates "embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>)." However, Allah's essence is unlike all essences and hence  <u>the analogy does not exist in the first place</u>. As a result, this theological language and the necessities (lawaazim) it assumes is invalidated as it relates to Allaah, and is not applicable to Allaah to begin with. Hence there is no caution in saying "<b>Allaah is above</b>" since that is what the revealed texts came with and it is the truth, and Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, "<b>there is nothing  like unto Him</b>" (42:11).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Do Not Let Atabek Shukrov Into Your House</font>    <P>
So the point here is that if Atabek Shukrov and his likes come knocking on your door and they say we want to discuss the narrator Hilaal bin Abi Maymoonah, and you let them in, then you have essentially acted in a way to legitimize and accept the greater crime that they committed earlier - which is using the conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in speaking about Allaah and abandoning the actual speech of Allaah itself, or distorting it to fit the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. This is like a murderer coming into your house in order to argue whether the car owned by the person he murdered was silver or black. So if you engage in that argument you've legitimized or downplayed his prior action of murder and he has succeeded in engaging you in a relatively trivial matter. Now having made this point, it does not mean we ignore these doubts brought by these people, of course not! These doubts have to be addressed and answered (see below). But we have to be clear about the actual size and priority of each of the doubts they bring and not to fall into their trap of inflating a doubt to make it much larger than what it actually is.     <P>
So when we compare this doubt of trying to cast aspersions upon the status of Hilal bin Abi Maymunah as a narrator, when we compare this with the presence of numerous other matters such as the fact of the Salaf having ijmaa' (consensus) that Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that this consensus is explicitly stated and narrated by Imaams from the Salaf, from them <b>al-Awzaa'ee</b> (d. 157H), <b>Qutaybah bin Sa'eed</b> (d. 240H), <b>Abu Zur'ah al-Raazee</b> (d. 264H) and <b>Abu Hatim al-Raazee</b> (d. 277H), <b>Zakariyyaa al-Saajee</b> (d. 307H), <b>Ibn Battah al-Ukbaree</b> (d. 387H), <b>Abu Umar al-Talamankee</b> (d. 429H), <b>Abu Nasr al-Sijzee</b> (d. 444H) and <b>Abu Uthmaan al-Saaboonee</b>  (d. 449H)  - indicating that the Salaf as a whole - (in particular the Imaams of the second century who figured and realized that the greatest goal of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> was to deny Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> through this new conceptual baggage of kalaam) - that they affirmed a matter that Atabek Shukrov is trying to deny through a relatively trivial matter (is Hilal bin Abi Maymunah <i>thiqah</i> or not) which he is fraudulently inflating to make it look as if he can reject a matter agreed upon by the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> (Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, al-Baqillani) and their Kullaabi forerunners (Ibn Kullaab, al-Harith al-Muhaasibee, <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a>, Ibn Mahdee al-Tabaree), let alone the entirety of the Salaf! Namely, that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (without that necessitating that He is a <i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i> - the view of the early <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah).    <P>
So we see this a deception and a fraud from Atabek Shukrov who is pushing the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> which is founded upon the language and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> and through which he is attempting to undermine the Sunnah.     <P>
As for the actual issue he raised, this can be addressed in brief here and a person can refer to the various lengthy rebuttals on this matter (such as <span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1601;&#1575;&#1593; &#1593;&#1606; &#1581;&#1583;&#1610;&#1579; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1575;&#1585;&#1610;&#1577;</span> by Abdullaah al-Khaleefee)  from which the materials below have been summarized.    <P>
</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Hadeeth of Mu'awiyah bin al-Hakam</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Following in footsteps of known and confirmed liars and academic fraudsters such as <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> and Hasan Alee Saqqaaf, Atabek Shukrov has tried to discredit the narrator, Hilaal bin Abi Maymoonah by downplaying his status using the tact of concealment and selective quoting.     <P>
First, let us mention the hadeeth of Mu'awiyah bin al-Hakam (radiallaahu anhu):    <P>
Muawiyah bin Al-Hakam said:    <P>
<blockquote>I had a slave-girl who used to herd sheep for me. One day I discovered that a wolf had killed one of her sheep, and I'm a man from the children of Adam, I get upset like they get upset, and I slapped her in the face. Then I went to the Prophet who impressed upon me the seriousness of my act. I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, should I not set her free?' He said, 'Bring her to me.' He asked her, 'Where is Allah', She said, 'He is above the heavens.' He said, 'Who am I?' She said, 'You are the Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Free her, for she is a believer.' (Muslim)</blockquote>    <P>
The isnaad (chain of narration) for this hadeeth is as follows: From <u>Yahyaa bin Abi Katheer</u>, from <u><font color='green'>Hilaal bin Abi Maymoonah</font></u>, from <u>Ataa bin Yasaar</u>, from <u>Mu'aawiyah</u>.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Atabek Shukrov's Academic Dishonesty and Attempted Fraud</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This hadeeth is a thorn in the throat of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and they have tried their best to discredit this particular hadeeth using numerous types of subterfuge. The first one we are discussing in this hadeeth is to cast doubt about the chain of narration. They do not deny the hadeeth itself is acceptable, because it is narrated by Imaam Muslim, however they try to cast doubt about a narrator by making his status less than what it actually is, and use that as a stepping stone to make the claim there is confusion (idtiraab).    <P>
This narrator is <b>Hilaal bin Abi Maymoonah</b>. Atabek Shukrov follows the way of <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> and Saqqaaf by presenting only a few statements of some of the Scholars of Hadeeth regarding the rank of this narrator. The first statement is that of al-Nasaa'ee who said, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1575; &#1576;&#1571;&#1587; &#1576;&#1607; </span>) "<i>There is no harm in him (meaning he is alright)</i>" and that of Abu Haatim al-Raazee who said, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1588;&#1610;&#1582;</span>) "<i>Shaykh</i>." By citing only these two statements, Atabek proceeds to say that these are not glowing, praiseworthy statements and do not make Hilaal a high-ranking narrator, but he is just at the acceptable level whereby his truthfulness is merely ascertained - but as for a great deal of precision and memory, then he is not like those top-ranking narrators.     <P>
The aim of Atabek and his <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> precedecessors before him (such as al-Kawtharee) is to try to make it look as if there is idtiraab (confusion) surrounding the narration as a whole and casting doubt about the status of Hilal bin Abi Maymunah is just one element that forms part of that broader aim.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What Atabek Shukrov Hid Out of Deception</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Here is what Atabek Shukrov did not mention (very conveniently):    <P>
<b>ONE:</b> The fact that Imaam <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a>, the Ameer al-Mu'mineen of Hadeeth uses Hilaal bin Abi  Maymunah  as proof (for  narrations) more than once in his Saheeh, indicating that he is "thiqah (trustworthy) to him. And Muslim has also used him as proof in narrations, and this led al-Haakim to state in al-Mustadrak (1/208):     <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1602;&#1583; &#1575;&#1578;&#1601;&#1602;&#1575; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1580;&#1577; &#1576;&#1585;&#1608;&#1575;&#1610;&#1575;&#1578; &#1607;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604; &#1576;&#1606; &#1571;&#1576;&#1610; &#1607;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604; &#1608;&#1610;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606;  &#1571;&#1576;&#1610; &#1605;&#1610;&#1605;&#1608;&#1606;&#1577; &#1608;&#1610;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610; &#1608;&#1610;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606; &#1571;&#1587;&#1575;&#1605;&#1577; &#1608;&#1603;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;  </div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They (al-Bukhari and Muslim) have both agreed upon the narrations of Hilaal bin Abi Hilaal as constituting proof (hujjah) and it is also said Hilaal bin Abi Maymoonah and it is said Ibn Alee and it is also said Ibn Usaamah and it is all one (person).</blockquote>    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> Ibn Hajar mentions in  Tahdheeb al-Tahdheeb (11/82):    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1584;&#1603;&#1585;&#1607; &#1576;&#1606; &#1581;&#1576;&#1575;&#1606; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1579;&#1602;&#1575;&#1578; ... &#1608;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1575;&#1585;&#1602;&#1591;&#1606;&#1610;: &#1607;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604; &#1576;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610; &#1579;&#1602;&#1577; &#1608;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1605;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1604;&#1577; &#1579;&#1602;&#1577;</div>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Atabek Shukrov's Academic Fraud in Ruins</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Why did Atabek Shukrov deceive his audience through a paltry citation (from al-Nasa'ee and Abu Haatim), deliberately omitting a large amount of what is established with respect to Hilal bin Abi Maymunah, that he is a narrator of al-Bukharee (and hence a narrator of the two Imaams, al-Bukharee and Muslim), that he is from the narrators of Imaam Maalik, that he is declared thiqah by numerous authorities in hadeeth, and that the hadeeth is narrated with this wording by other than Imaam Muslim, such as <a href='tags/ibn-khuzaymah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Khuzaymah</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> who also authenticated the hadeeth as "saheeh" based on its isnaad. With this matter cleared about Hilal bin Abi Maymunah, we now move to the next issue which is another hadeeth in the Musannaf of Abdur-Razzaq in which it is alleged by the likes of Hasan Alee Saqqaaf and others (whom Atabek is following in this doubt) that another similar incident is reported about Mu'awiyah bin al-Hakam in which the details differ, and hence, it appears there is idtiraab (confusion) in what is narrated in the hadeeth of Imaam Muslim.   </blockquote>   <P>
