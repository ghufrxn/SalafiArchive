<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> often make citations from some of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and then leave those citations without comment or context, hoping by that to deceive the audience into thinking that the author of those words is in agreement with their particular <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> belief, when the reality is otherwise.</div>    <P>
Here is one such example, from Imam <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H). The quote is through <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> and occurs in Fath al-Bari (13/396) under al-Bukhari's chapter heading, "The Saying of Allaah, the Exalted, <i>Whom I created with My own two hands</i>."    <P>

Sayf al-Din al-Aamidee (d. 631H) wrote in his book Ghayat al-Maraam (p. 135)    <P>

And then we have <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> (d. 478H) stating in al-Irshad (p. 155):    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Chapter: Two hands, two eyes and face. Some of our leading scholars (a'immah) have gone to the view that the two hands, <b>two eyes</b> and face are established attributes for the Lord, the Exalted, and that the path to affirming them is the revealed texts, without entering the realm of reason (&#703;aql).</blockquote>    <P>
These are two texts from two very prominent <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a> who affirm that there are those from their school who affirm two eyes for Allah, and they are referring to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> amongst others. <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> affirmed two eyes as occurs in his book al-Tamhid, <a href=indexdac3.html?tlyai>you can read that here</a> where he said:    <P>

Then in al-Maqaalaat (tahqiq Muhammad Muhyi al-Din, Egypt, 1950), <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a> affirms two eyes for Allah, whilst quoting the view of Ahl al-Sunnah, which he says that he follows and adheres to:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ashari-maqalat-sifat-khabar.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
So he mentioned here face, two hands and two eyes. However, whilst these Ash'aris were in agreement with the Salaf on this matter, they had a methodological departure from the way of the Salaf in that they used specific negations in the course of corroboration of their belief, such as saying, "<i>We affirm Allaah has a hand which is not a limb</i>", "<i>We affirm Allaah has an eye which is not a pupil</i>", and so on. And whilst this meaning is true and correct, to specify these negations is not from the way of the Salaf in affirmation of their aqidah which is to say, "<i>We affirm Allaah has a face, hand, eye, but which does not resemble that of the creation</i>" - so here the negation is general. Nevertheless, these <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> who held this view are commended for their agreement with the Salaf in the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> of the matter.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So this is the view that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> is affirming, and he is affirming the attribute of hand and likewise whatever is mentioned regarding it of the various actions, then those are from the muqtadaa (requirement) of the attribute of hand, and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> says that affirming all of this, without mumaasah (touch, contact) does not entail any tashbih at all and that this is one view amongst the Mutakallimeen. Now this is the view for which the later <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> who abandoned the way of the early Kullabi Ash'aris fraudulently use to accuse Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the way of the Salaf of the first three centuries, of falling into tashbih and tajsim. So this is a great crime on their behalf, and they will have to answer for it on the Day of Judgement, and it is oppression and slander. However, there is just one methodological difference as already pointed out, Ahl al-Sunnah do not make specific negations, they simply affirm what Allaah and His Messenger (alayhis salaam) affirmed for Him, and then deny there is any resemblance between the reality of that and the reality found in the creation. And it would not have been so bad if these false accusations came from the ignorant ones amongst them but when it comes from those whom are considered scholars amongst them such as <a href='tags/nuh-keller.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuh Keller</font></a> and his likes (<a href=dld83f3.html?a=nuh-keller-deception.pdf>see his disgraceful scandal here</a>), then it makes the matter much worse.</div>    <P>
As for the second view that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> mentions, then it is of those who followed the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in making ta'wil of these attributes, and that's what you have present today, those who abandoned the way of the early Kullabi Ash'aris. The <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> were no doubt sounder in intellect than the contemporaries who lack integrity, honesty and justice and are upon a hybrid of the usool of the Kullaabiyah, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a>.    <P>
