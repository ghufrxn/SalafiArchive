<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
We were requested recently to comment on statement of creed issued by a person named <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> of Birmingham, who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> / Maturidi in creed (the word "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" is an umbrella term that includes the Maturidis, that's how most Maturidis themselves see it). A scan of a statement of creed written by this individual was sent to us on 5th April 2011. <u>We have  no idea when it was written</u>, but we commenced responding to it on 14th April 2011. In the commentary upon this statement, we will come to realize how today's Ash'aris do not really differentiate between the early Kullabi Ash'aris (who were much closer to Ahl al-Sunnah) and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who reverted to many of the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and left the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. At the same time, these contemporaries deceive themselves into thinking that what they are upon is the way of the Salaf, when the reality is that they are not even upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his early students (the Kullaabi Ash'aris), let alone the way of the Salaf. Further, when they present their creed, it is presented in a deceptive manner using generalizations and vagueness, and the avoidance of any specificity and detail so as to allow a false ascription to the Salaf to be made in front of the audience.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The reader is advised to get a good solid grasp on the reality behind the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis and this can be done by studying the following two sets of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
Whilst there are lots of other articles on this site that are also important and beneficial, these two sets of articles will give you the best comprehension of the entire subject matter and give you an good overview of the deen of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and their various offshoots. With this background information, you will better comprehend this series of articles.     <P>
<b><u>Note:</u> It is not our intent to bring extensive quotations and discuss particular issues in detail, because all of the background knowledge and detailed discussions have already been covered in other articles. Equipped with that knowledge, it becomes very easy to identify Tajahhum and its practitioners and see their errors, mistakes and deceptions in their speech and writings. So all we will be doing in these articles is to make pointers.</b>   </div>    <P>
Before we start commenting on his statement, we should clarify that <b>all of those we have addressed previously on this site</b> have been proven to be dishonest, conniving, calculated people, whose lies are plain and manifest to see to anyone with even an ounce of sincerity and the desire for seeking truth.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These are people like Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
So Allaah knows best about <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> how he will behave after the hujjah is established upon him that his orientation in creed (coming from the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi schools) is founded originally upon a matter that the Salaf condemned and vilified, namely the blameworthy <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> which he is trying so desperately to hide. What we find in practice is that as it becomes increasingly clear that the later As'haris had little to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and lost connection with him and that the Maturidis, from the very outset, were closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in creed than they were to the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, <u>these people became more shrewd and more adept</u> in the way they formulate and present their creed to the masses so as to conceal many things (by ommission) and to give the false picture that they are following the Salaf by maintaining policy of speaking in generalizations devoid of tafseelaat (details).     <P>

<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Translation and Commentary: Part 4</font>    <P>
Asrar Rashid wrote:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah, the Sublime, has negated from Himself any mithl (likeness) for Him and any shabeeh (resemblance) with Him, and He emphasized that, and did not just say, "<i>laysi mithlihi shay</i>", "There is no likeness unto Him." But [the addition of the kaaf before "mithl"] contains a strengthening of emphasis in negating anything that is a likeness (matheel) to Him or has resemblance (shabeeh) with Him.  Hence, there is no mumaathalah (likeness), and no mushaabahah (resemblance) between Him, the Sublime and Exalted, and between His creation. He does not resemble them, and nor do they resemble Him, with a negation of (resemblance) that is general, from all angles. Everything that the imaginations and thoughts conceive of, then Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted is different to it.</blockquote>    <P>
There are a number of observations to make here:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> This speech in this paragraph is correct in and of itself with the exception of one matter discussed further below. However, the reader should keep in mind that that after centuries of deception, the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> have become very adept at using general phraseology and language that appears to be identical to the madhhab of the Salaf so they can give the impression their methodology in aqidah is the methodology of the Salaf, and they can maintain this illusion by avoiding going into tafseelaat (specifics). What the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> intend by negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> is not synonymous<u></u> with  what Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf, intend by this, because Ahl al-Sunnah have entered the house from its proper entrance, whereas <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> have entered the house from other than its proper place, they simply followed, in their theology, what the Hellenized nations fell into (the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who used the conceptual tools of the Greeks, <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, in their theology), and we have remarked about this in previous parts so refer to them for the details.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> As for the matter that needs clarification then it is the statement of <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1588;&#1576;&#1607;&#1607;&#1605; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1588;&#1576;&#1607;&#1608;&#1606;&#1607; &#1606;&#1601;&#1610;&#1575; &#1593;&#1575;&#1605;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606; &#1580;&#1605;&#1610;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1607;</span>), "<i>He does not resemble them, and nor do they resemble Him, with a negation of (resemblance) that is general, from all angles</i>." This absolution, stated in this manner, is not correct, otherwise it leads to the divestment of Allaah, the Exalted of all of His attributes, and this is the foundation of the argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against the affirmers of the attributes. <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a> acknowledged and admitted in "Nihaayat al-Uqool", as is cited by him by Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in Bayan Talbis al-Jahmiyyah (2/494, ed. Rasheed Hasan Muhammad Alee), the following matter:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayan-talbis-2-494.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if you mean by the mushabbih, the one who says that Allaah, the Exalted, <u>resembles His creation from some angles, then this does not necessitate kufr (disbelief)</u> because the Muslims are agreed that Allaah exists (mawjood) and is a thing (shay'), and knowing (aalim), able (qaadir), and the animals (al-hayawaanaat) are like that too, and that does not necessitate kufr. And if you mean by the mushabbih, the one who says that al-Ilaah (Allaah) is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) in a specific place, then we do not accept that a consensus has been established upon the takfeer  of the one who says that, rather it is [only] a claimed consensus in a matter of dispute, so it is not turned to.</blockquote>    <P>
To deny resemblance, <b>from every single angle, absolutely</b>, necessitates the denial of everything that Allaah is described with, and this absolution is the foundation of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and upon it they argued against the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> who had a good response to them (see further below). The truth is that the denial of <i>mithl</i> and <i>matheel</i> and <i>mumaathalah</i> (i.e. likeness) is absolute, and as for <i>mushaabahah</i>, (resemblance) there is resemblance from certain angles in that Allaah is said to exist, have life, have knowledge, speak, hear, see and so on and His creatures also have life, knowledge, and can hear, see and speak. So this is resemblance from an angle.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Further, there is a degree of commonality in the base meaning in the attributes shared between Allaah and His creation, like those mentioned as examples, life, knowledge, will, hearing, seeing and so on. If this had not been the case, <b>it would be completely impossible</b> to know anything about Allaah, the Exalted. Hence, when we say Allaah has knowledge, then we only understand what it is we are affirming for Allaah <u>in meaning</u> because we already have an idea of <i>the meaning</i> of "knowledge" from what we have experienced, and whilst there is a degree of commonality in the foundational, base meaning of "knowledge" (which allows us to affirm something for Allaah beyond mere collections of letters) <u>how</u> that knowledge is with Allaah and <u>how</u> He knows, and <u>the reality</u> of His knowledge is unknowable and unfathomable and <u>does not resemble the reality</u> of the attribute of knowledge as found in His creatures. If you grasp this matter, you will fully grasp the great mistake of these people (the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and in particular the Ash'aris and Maturidis) in denying much of what Allaah has affirmed for Himself.     <P>
We see in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Allaah describe Himself as al-Hayy (living) (2:255) and the creation as also living (al-hayy) (30:19), and He describes Himself as Aleem (knowing) and Haleem (forbearing) and He described the sons of Ibraaheem (alayhis salaam), as aleem and haleem (see 51:28, 37:101). And He described Himself as Samee' Baseer (hearing, seeing) and mankind as samee', baseer (see 4:58, 76:2). And likewise Allaah is Ra'oof, Raheem (Compassionate, Merciful) and He described the Messenger as ra'oof, raheem (see 2:143, 9:128), and the same can be said about Malik, Mu'min, Azeez, Jabbaar, Mutakabbir, all of these are used by Allaah for Himself and for His creation. And as for attributes we see ilm (knowledge), quwwah (strength), ayd (strength, power), mashee'ah (will), iraadah (wish), mahabbah (love), ridaa (pleasure), maqt (hatred), makr (plotting), 'amal (action), munaadaah (calling out), munaajaah (private conversation), takleem (speaking), tanbi'ah (informing), ta'leem (teaching), <a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a> (anger) - all of these are mentioned for both Allaah and His creation in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And then we see also, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascending), yadaan (hands), wajh (face) mentioned for both Allaah and His creation in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and there is more that is in the Sunnah.    <P>
And there is no doubt that whilst we understand universal meanings for all of these things, <b>their actual external realities only apply when idaafah (ascription), and takhsees (specification) is made</b>, as in when we say "Allaah's knowledge" and "man's knowledge" and "<a href="tags/allaahs-pleasure.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Allaah's Pleasure</font></a>" and "man's pleasure", so when this ascription and specification is made (of a universal meaning to an entity), the realities differ, even though there is a degree of commonality in meaning in the terms "knowledge" and "pleasure" (no matter to whom they are applied to) and the same applies to all other names and attributes. In other words, we have a universal meaning in the term "knowledge", and when we say "Allaah's knowledge" we have moved from that universal meaning to specification, and when we say "man's knowledge" we have moved from a universal  meaning to another specification, and while the specifications are different, we still have a base, common element in the meaning that we have affirmed in both specifications, and affirming this for Allaah and His creation, does not in any way necessitate tamaathul (likeness) or mushaabahah (resemblance) <u>in the realities of these specifications</u>, since with respect to Allaah, they are unknown to us. So for this reason we have absolutely no caution in affirming life, knowledge, will, hearing, seeing, face, hands, anger, pleasure, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and so on for Allaah, because, upon what has just been mentioned, there is not and cannot be any <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> necessitated. This is the foundation of the <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) of the Salaf.    <P>
And had this not been the case, <b>then we would not be able to have any knowledge of Allaah whatsoever</b>, and affirming anything at all for Allaah would automatically count as <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. But Ahl al-Sunnah treat everything upon a uniform principle, and they derive their speech about Allaah from the revealed texts and you see complete coherence and conformity in what they are upon and in their principles. But as for the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, they are confused, contradictory and do not have any coherence at all, because the principles they operate upon in speech about Allaah are derived from the conceptual tools of the Hellenized nations primarily (the discussion of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>), and they consider their conclusions based upon this foreign knowledge and philosophy to be superior to the affirmations in the revealed texts (aql over naql) as is <u>explicitly elaborated upon</u> by Fakhr al-Deen al-Raazee in his universal principle (<u>al-qaanoon al-kullee</u>) in his book <i>Asaas al-Taqdees</i> where he clearly says that if reason conflicts with revelation, reason comes first.</div>    <P>
The Ash'aris and Maturidis who affirm some attributes yet deny others do not have any sound, coherent answer when asked why they can affirm iraadah (wish) and hayaat (life) and yet deny wajh (face), hands (yadaan), anger (<a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a>), pleasure (ridaa) and the likes. This is because it is impossible to form <u>universal meanings and concepts</u> in the mind except through what is observed and perceived in this creation.  <u>Note, we are speaking of <b>meanings</b> here, not external realities</u>. This is how we know "knowledge" is the meaning we associate with it, and "wish" is the meaning we associate with it and "life" is the meaning we associate with it. When this is the case, it is contradictory to distinguish between the attributes which Allaah has affirmed for Himself in the revealed texts, and to say for example that we affirm knowledge (without that necessitating embodiment, tajseem), but cannot affirm hands (because that necessitates embodiment, tajseem), and we affirm life (without that necessitating embodiment) but cannot affirm face etc. The reason is that you only came to know the meanings of all things (including existence, knowledge, life, will, power, hearing, seeing, speech) on account of what you outwardly observed in this creation, and from this angle you cannot distinguish between any of the attributes in the sense of how you came to know of their meanings. In other words, your knowledge of the meanings of life, knowledge, will, power, hearing, seeing and so on only came to be in terms what you have observed outwardly in creation. You have not seen the "meaning" of "life" except that is manifested in or through a body, and likewise for the other attributes of knowledge, will, hearing, seeing and so on. It is impossible for you to point to any manifestation of life, knowledge, will etc. except that it requires a body for it to exist or subsist. <u>However</u>, we (as Ahl al-Sunnah) differentiate between <b><u>a)</u></b> the universal meaning that is formed in the mind and at the same time distinguished from other universal meanings (i.e. "knowledge", when thought of in the mind, is other than "life" which is other than "seeing" which are other than "speech" and which are other than "face" and so on) and <b><u>b)</u></b> the reality associated with that meaning in what we outwardly observe and see, in other words when we have made takhsees and idaafah and taqyeed (specification, annexation). We will take this matter up further in the next point:    <P>
<b>Third:</b> The best way to illustrate the above is to draw upon  two citations we made in <a href=index6dc9.html?gbokn>Part 3</a>, from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and what better way to silence todays <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> parading as "Ash'aris" than through the statements of these two Scholars (to whom the Ash'aris of today have little connection, and you will soon understand why!). Think about what we have just said and <u>then reflect upon the nature of the argument</u> being employed by both <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and al-Baqillaani against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in these two quotes:    <P>

It is said to him: That is not necessitated, just like it is not necessitated when we do not understand a living, knowing, able (being) except to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that we, us and you, should judge Allah with the same.</b>    <P>
And just like it is not necessitated when He is established by His own Essence (qaa'iman bi dhaatihi) that He is <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and body just because we, and you, do not find anything established by itself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi) in what we (outwardly) observe except that it is like that (i.e. <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Substance</font></a> and body).    <P>
And the answer to them is likewise if they say: It becomes necessary that His knowledge, life and speech <b><u>and all of His attributes belonging to His Essence (dhaat)</u></b> are non-essential incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), genuses, or occurrences (hawaadith), or changes, or coalesce (merge) in Him, or are in requirement of a heart, and they adduced the existence (wujood) [that they observe] as  argument [in this regard]</blockquote>    <P>
And this he took no doubt from Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who said, addressing the same doubt (in <i>al-Ibaanah</i>, ta&#7717;q&#299;q, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Ma&#7717;m&#363;d, Egypt, 1977, pp. 136-137):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Issue: And it is said to them: What has led you to reject that All&#257;h, the Exalted meant two hands by His saying, "<b>With my two hands (biyadayya)</b>" (38:75) and not two favours? If they say: Because if <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand) is not [with the meaning of] favour (ni&#703;mah) then it is but a limb (j&#257;ri&#7717;ah).    <P>
It is said to them: Why have you judged that if hand is not favour, then it is but a limb? ... They said: <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> (hand), when it is not favour in what is observed, it is but a limb. It is said to them: If you are working [on the basis] of what is observed [in creation] and you judged All&#257;h by way of it, then likewise, we do not find any living thing  (hayyan) in the creation except as a body, flesh and blood. So judge All&#257;h with  that (too) [i.e. as He is also living], exalted is All&#257;h from that. And if not then you are [obliged] to abandon your saying because you are contradicting your very own justification [in argument].  And if you affirm [one who is] living but not like the living [creatures], then what has led to you reject that He has two hands which All&#257;h, the Exalted informed about, which are neither two favours nor two limbs, and nor like the hands [of the creatures].     <P>
Likewise, it is said to them: We do not find any mudabbir (controller), hak&#299;m (wise), except as a human, but then you affirm that the world has a mudabbir and &#7717;ak&#299;m who is not like a human, and you opposed what is observed [in the creation] and you contradicted your own justification [in argument against us]. Therefore do not prevent from the affirmation of two hands that are not two favours or two limbs for the reason that it is opposed to what is observed. </blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> What Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> intends here is: Don't deny the affirmation of two hands for All&#257;h upon the argument that if they are not two favours and not two limbs, then this opposes what is observed in creation, since we only know in what is observed, either hand as "favour", or hand as "a limb". So al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; is refuting this argument of the Mu&#703;tazilah and explains that you are in contradiction when you affirm other matters for All&#257;h, because the same argument equally applies there as well, since we only know of other meanings established for Allaah through the manifestation of these meanings in man, however, it is not necessitated that the realities associated with these meanings are the same.    <P>
What you see in the speech of al-Baqillaani and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> is an argument founded upon the reality we have already spoken about in the earlier points regarding <u>the nature of language and meaning</u> and thus we distinguish between universal concepts in the mind and the external realities associated with them, and thus with regard to the universal concepts in the mind (which are captured, identified and communicatetd through words), there must be a degree of commonality in the foundational, base meanings (between Allaah and His creation), <b>otherwise it would be impossible for Allaah to communicate knowledge to us</b> by which the hearts know Him, love Him and yearn for Him. However, as for the realities (haqaa'iq) of the attributes, they are appropriate to the one being described. Thus, the creation have life, knowledge, will, hearing, seeing, face, hands, anger, pleasure in a way that is appropriate to them and their essences and Allaah, the Exalted has life, knowledge, will, hearing, seeing, face, hands, anger, pleasure in a manner that befits His essence (which is unlike all other essences), and the only thing we are obligated with is to affirm what Allaah affirmed for Himself and negate any mithl (likeness) from Him and to negate resemblance from Him in <u>the reality</u> of His attributes, not in the base foundational meanings, in which there has to be some degree of commonality, <b>otherwise, it is not possible for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to affirm any attributes <u>at all</u> and they would have to deny all attributes to avoid <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, and would have to take the stance of the deniers of the attributes outright, like the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, in order to remain coherent in their argument.</b>    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> From the above, we see that this absolution in the statement of <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> is incorrect, and it is a mistake even according to the statement of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> in what is related from him, as has preceded.    <P>
<b>Fifth:</b> As for Asrar's final statement, "<i>Everything that the imaginations and thoughts conceive of, then Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted is different to it</i>," then this is approximate to what al-Tahawi has mentioned at the beginning of his creed, and this relates to the haqaa'iq (realities) of what Allaah is described with, but as for the meanings, then when the mind thinks of Allaah having knowledge, and life, and wish, and hearing, and seeing, and so on, then the mind can certainly reach and grasp a foundational element of these meanings, but not the realities associated with them as they exist with Allaah the Exalted. This is becauses fathoming and grasping something can only occur through one of three ways: a) seeing it directly, b) seeing its like or c) being informed of a trustworthy one with sound knowledge of it. As for the first two, they are impossible with respect to Allaah, and as for the third, then it is whatever knowledge Allaah reveals to His Prophets and Messengers about Himself who convey it. And it is through this knowledge that the hearts and minds know of Allaah as living, knowing, hearing, seeing, speaking, generous, wise, merciful and so on with all the other attributes. So they know and grasp something of meaning, as a result of which their hearts know Him and love Him and yearn for Him, which shows that this revealed knowledge is the very foundation of the worship of Allaah, the Exalted. But as for the haqaa'iq (realities) then whatever the imaginations and understandings (intellects) try to conceive, imagine and think of, then Allaah is different to it.    <P>
<b>And all of this is in perfect accord with the position of the Salaf which is to make <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> with negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and takyeef</b>. As for the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, then they fall into confusion and discrepancy and they cannot follow a uniform principle in this regard, and suffice it as proof that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> differ with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> differ with the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, yet the creed of all of them is founded upon the same <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the proof of huduth al-ajsaam based upon the conceptual tools and language of the Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians and Sabeans) who preceded them in this particular <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which we established and proved beyond doubt in <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series of articles</a> (on <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites).    <P>
<b>Sixth:</b> <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> is not following the way of the Salaf, he is lying in his claim, rather he is following the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, and all he has done is to make vague general statements which are mostly based around negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and so on, in order to give the illusion he is following the Salaf, and avoided committing himself to specific <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a>. However, as we said in a previous article, there is no escape from mentioning at least something besides the generalizations (even if it is just hinted at) otherwise, the statement of creed would be meaningless to anyone who reads it, and for this reason we see that he addressed the issue of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah in a very indirect way and  he addressed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> at the very end of his statement, which is the subject we will tackle next inshaa'Allaah, proving that He is a Jahmee in that regard, and certaintly not a follower of the Salaf, or <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, or <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, or al-Qalanisee, or Ibn Mahdee al-Tabaree, or even al-Baqillaani, rather he is with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
