<p>This is amongst the doubts of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> used to argue that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, which is the speech of Allaah, is created. It is not an argument used by the Ash'aris, just to make it clear - even though their saying regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have with us is the same as that of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. But it shows the manner in which the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> tried to twist an abundance of verses in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in order to argue for the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (that we have, in its letters and words, and which we recite, hear and memorize) being created.    <P>
From, "al-Masaa'il war-Rasaa'il al-Marwiyyah Anil-Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal Fil Aqeedah" (Issues and Treatise Narrated from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal Regarding Aqeedah), 1/218-219, there occurs:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ahmad-jahmiyyah-eesaa-kalimah.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He said: Then the Jahmee claimed another matter. He said:    <P>
<blockquote>I find a verse in the Book of Allaah that indicates the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. The saying of Allaah, "<b>Indeed al-Maseeh, <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> the Son of Maryam (Jesus, Son of Mary) is the Messenger of Allaah, and His Word which He bestowed upon Maryam</b>..." (an-Nisaa 4:171). And <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> is created.</blockquote>    <P>
So we say:     <P>
<b>Indeed Allaah has prevented you from understanding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.</b>    <P>
There are words that are applied to <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> that are not applied to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, since he (<a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>) has been called, "mawlood" (born), "tifl" (infant), "sabiyy" (boy), "ghulaam (youth)", that he eats, and he is addressed with command and prohibition, and the name of discourse and threat is applicable to him. Then further, he is from the offspring of Nuh, and from the offspring of Ibraaheem. Therefore it is not permissible for us to say regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> what we say regarding <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>.    <P>
And have you heard Allaah say regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> what He said regarding <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>?     <P>
Rather, the meaning in the saying of Allaah, <b>"Indeed al-Maseeh, <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> the Son of Maryam (Jesus, Son of Mary) is the Messenger of Allaah, and His Word</b>..." [is that] the word which He bestowed upon Maryam is when He said to him (<a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>) "kun (Be)!" and so <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> became through [the word] "Be!", and <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> [himself] is not [the word] "Be!" For "(kun) Be!" is from the saying of Allaah, and "kun" is not created.    <P>
And the Christians and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> lied upon Allaah in the affair of <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>, and this is [because] the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> said: "Ruhallaah (the Spirit of Allaah) and His Word, except that His word is created."    <P>
And the Christians said: "Eesaa is the Spirit of Allaah from the Essence of Allaah, and the Word of Allaah from the Essence of Allaah", just like it is said "this tatter (shred, piece) is from that thawb (garment)"    <P>
We say: <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> became through a word and he is not the word itself, rather the word is the word of Allaah (kalimah), the saying of Allaah (qawl).    <P>
[And] His saying [thereafter], "...<b>and a spirit from Him</b> ...", He [Allaah] is saying: From his command was the spirit in him, [this is] like His saying, "<b>And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the Earth all of it, [as a favour] from Him...</b>" (Jaathiyah 45:13). He [Allaah] is saying: From His command [was the spirit put in him]. And the explanation of "Ruhullaah (Spirit of Allaah)" is that it is a spirit through a word (kalimah) of Allaah, Allah created it (the spirit) [through that word], just as it is said, "Abdullaah (the slave of Allaah)", "Samaa'ullaah (the heaven of Allaah)", and "Ardullaah (the earth of Allaah)."</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Positions of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Their Offshoots Regarding the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font>    <P>
Because Jahm argued against the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> (Indian Materialist Philosophers) that an entity having attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) is proof of its "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" (meaning to him createdness), then he was unable to describe Allaah to them with what is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> otherwise that would have falsified his proof for a Creator.  Thus, he deemed his proof to be decisive and instead rejected all of what is in the revealed texts of Names, Attributes and Actions for Allaah. And it was out of the necessity of this rejection that <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, tafweed and tahreef was born and this then became the overall concern in the deen of the Mutakallimeen. To protect from invalidation what they thought to be the ultimate truth - their corrupt and false proof for the existence of a creator.    <P>
And amongst the specific views necessitated by this intellectual proof was: To deny Allaah spoke to Moses as this would amount to a "haadithah" and necessitate Allaah is a created body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) subject to an "event". And also to claim that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is memorized and recited is created (makhlooq) and is not Allaah's speech - again for the same reason, to negate "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/jismiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jismiyyah</font></a>" from Allaah - otherwise this would falsify the proof against the atheists. Thereafter, the offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> inherited this saying, and we can summarize the sayings of the various factions:    <P>
<b>The Jahmiyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is that the Qur'aan is created, that Allah does not have the attribute of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) to begin with, and He is not "mutakallim", and they interpret "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" to mean something within the creation, separate from Allaah. So Allaah created the "Qur'aan" and He therafter called it "His Speech" in the same manner that it can be said, "Baytullaah" about the Ka'bah, and "Naaqqatullaah", the She-Camel of Allaah and so on.    <P>
<b>The Mu'tazilah</b>    <P>
And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took up this deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their view is the same of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the Qur'aan is created with the only difference being that  Allaah created it in the self of Jibreel (alayhis salaam) and Jibreel expressed it in his own words, or that he simply "quoted" the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that was created in his self. And that the speech of Allaah can be created in different situations, so for example, with Moses, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) was created in the tree and so on.    <P>
<b>The Kullaabiyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the Kullabiyyah is that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created and it is a "<u>hikaayah</u>" (quotation, narrative) of the meaning (ma'naa) that exists with Allaah's self, and it is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is present with Allah's self as a meaning that is not created, and he was the first to innovate this saying, and the Ash'aris took this from him. And this saying of theirs is based upon the fact that they do not affirm attributes of Allaah that are tied to His will and power - so whilst they affirm "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" as an eternal attribute of the essence, they reject that it is also tied to Allaah's will and power - as this would invalidate their intellectual proof.    <P>
<b>The Ash'ariyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is the same as that of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> save that they say that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created and is an "<u>ibaarah</u>" (expression) of the meaning (ma'naa) that exists with Allaah's self, and it is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is present with Allah's self as a meaning that is not created.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>All of these factions are agreed that <u>this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, consisting of letters and words</u>, that is memorized, recited and heard is created and that Allaah did not speak the words in this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. They do not differ in this and as such <u>they are all Jahmiyyah</u> and the speech of the Salaf is applicable to all of them without exception, since they hold what the Salaf condemned of beliefs and statements regarding the issue of the Qur'aan - and this is manifest when one looks at the vast and abundant speech quoted from them in the books of aqeedah.    <P>
And the true and real difference between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the one hand and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> on the other - after their agreement that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, which we recite and memorize is created - is on what basis can we then call Allaah "mutakallim (one who speaks), with <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech)". So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say it is permissible to say Allaah is "mutakallim" and has "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" on the basis that he creates it in others, its His creation but it can be attributed to him. And the Kullaabi Ash'aris reject this and say this is impossible, rather Allaah can be said to be "mutakallim" and have "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" on the basis that there is a "meaning (ma'naa)" present with Him, and this meaning is what is called "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>". This is readily admitted by the Imaams of the Ash'aris themselves such as  <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) - <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>see here</a>.</div> <P>
