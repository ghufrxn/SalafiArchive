<div class='sidebar'>  <blockquote>By the grace of Allaah, Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, who adhere to the Righteous Salaf of the first three centuries in their aqidah and manhaj are not unwise - walhamdulillaah - to those who pose as Ahl al-Sunnah whilst deceiving the Muslims <u>about history</u> and about the creed of the Righteous Salaf,  trying to undermine what is established in the fitrah of mankind that Allaah is above His creation. This is a matter which after leaving aside the Imaams of the Salaf, is affirmed even by the likes of <b>Ibn Kullaab, al-Harith al-Muhasibee, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a>, al-Baqillani</b> (and others from the early Kullabiyyaah and Ash'ariyyah) - all documented and established elsewhere on this website. This is in stark opposition to those who came after and turned instead to the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, abandoning the way of those early Kullabis and Ash'aris.     <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/atabek-jahmi-uluww.gif width=435 border=0></div>    <P>
This individual - who is <u>a Maturidi</u> in aqidah - has made his way to the North of England and alleged in his biographical account is the following:    <P>
<blockquote>Sheikh <a href='tags/atabek-shukrov-nasafi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atabek Shukrov Nasafi</font></a> is a noted scholar and specialist in Islamic aqeeda and theological sciences. Undertaking his religious studies at first in secret in Uzbekistan while it was part of the USSR, he has gone on to have an eclectic and comprehensive Islamic education all over the Muslim world. Already a scholar when he arrived in the Middle East, he studied in Damascus under such luminaries as Mhmd Adnan Darwish, graduating finally from Al Azhar but only after having studied both in Medina and the wider region, for example under Sh. Uthaymeen (and numerous others).</blockquote>    <P>
In this series we shall start deconstructing his academic frauds, distortion of history and lies against the Book of Allaah in a lecture he gave regarding "Where is Allaah?" and it will become clear by Allaah's permission that all we have here is just another <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> peddling a worn-out, outdated aqidah taken from the refuse of previous nations who had meddled in that same <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> before it entered into the Muslim Ummah, describing Allaah as "<i>not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> </i>..." upon the "negative theology" of the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their likes.    <P>
See the series "<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>" (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>here</a>) for an in-depth discussion of the real origin of "<a href="tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>" that entered the Muslim nation in the second century hijrah.    <P>
<b>NOTE:</b> The informed reader will already recognize the falsehood of this man through the abundant articles already present on this website that deal with this same issue. Also worthy of noting here is the use of the name of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, this is deception and is used to deceive his audience into perceiving him in a way that is other than the reality he is trying to hide.    <P>
In his lecture Shukrov has focused on the hadeeth of Mu'awiyah bin al-Hakam and the freeing of a slave-girl (related by Imaam  Muslim in his Saheeh), and he has followed a particular known strategy to deceive the audience, that we shall highlight in the articles to follow inshaa'Allaah. He has regurgitated the arguments of <b>Hasan Ali Saqqaaf</b> against the authenticity of the hadeeth.   </blockquote>    <P>

<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In the second century hijrah, the Righteous Salaf became embroiled in a bitter war against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who entered "<i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>" into the Ummah. This "<a href="tags/ilm-al-kalam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ilm al-kalam</font></a>" is in reality speech about Allaah and speech about the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and speech about Allaah's attributes upon the conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, a man whose logic and philosophy had already corrupted the aqidah of the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> with respect to Allaah and His Attributes. Hence, instead of the language of the Tawheed of the Messengers, which is to affirm for Allaah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him with denial of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> (likening) and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resembling) - (a uniform, consistent principle for all of what Allaah is described with) - they adopted the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, and specifically his Ten Categories (al-Maqulat al-Ashar) as a basis for their Tawhid:    <P>
The first category deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (a'raad, also referred to as "accidents") which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol>    <P>
So essentially, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> changed from having tasdeeq in what the Messenger informed with respect to His Lord of attributes and actions, alongside affirming that there is no likeness to Him in that regard, to having tasdeeq in the language of a star-worshipper who used the motion (harakah) observed in the Universe as a foundation for affirming an eternal, unmoved "First Cause" which he subsequently described as "<i>not a body, not in space, not in time, without parts, indivisble</i>..." And whoever cannot see that this language for their version of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is but the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> brought to the Muslims through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Rafidah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah is either ignorant or dishonest. <b>This was the "kalam" that the Salaf condemned and declared the one who spoke about Allaah on its basis as a heretic, astray and deviant. </b>    <P>
Certainly <u>we are not deceived</u> by the fact that these people claim to refute the atheists and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> by trying to prove that the universe is originated (as opposed to being eternal). This is a ploy to hide and conceal the fact that <u>they are in total agreement with those very same atheists and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (from them <b><a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a></b>) regarding the way they describe their deity</u> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see right here</a>). For they are all united upon making that conceptual baggage to be the language of truth and authority in describing Allaah, the Most High, over and above the revealed texts. In turn, they subjected the revealed texts to <u>the washing machine</u> of tanzeeh which they manufactured with two flavours, that of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> (light) [innovated by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah] and that of <i>tafweed</i> (heavy duty) [innovated by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> of the fifth century hijrah] - all so that these texts could be made to conform to that language which they made their foundation and so that the speech of Allaah could be cleansed of the "stains" of apparent <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> they allege it contains. Their so called "tanzeeh" is unlike the tanzeeh of the Salaf which is to affirm what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him whilst negating <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> - this is the tanzeeh of the Salaf, as is clear from hundreds of their statements - it is not to distort and reject the attributes or explain them away after alleging that there is inherent <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> within them - the Salaf were never upon that.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Do not be deceived by the apparent opposition shown by these people to the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (like Ibn Sina) because for a long time (since the time of Razi) kalam and falsfah has merged and they have become a single <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, united against the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers which they consider to be expressions of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> suitable only for dumb commoners so as to instill faith into them in the way  most befitting and easy for their (inferior) intellects (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>). It should be no surprise that <a href='tags/atabek-shukrov-nasafi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atabek Shukrov Nasafi</font></a> is a prominent figure in the "Avicenna Academy"  (the <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> Academy)! And you thought <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> were enemies of the Mutafalsifah! Well despite the arguments between <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> in certain issues, they were in fact united and in agreement in the type of deity they presented using that Aristotelian language (<a href=_a.html href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>).</div>    <P>
So the war began in the second century between the Righteous Salaf such as Ayub al-Sakhtiyaani, Hammaad bin Zaid, Imaam al-Zuhree, Imaam al-Awzaa'ee, Sufyan bin Uyainah, Imaam Malik bin Anas, Imaam al-Shaafi'ee and  many others against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their figureheads and they fought against them with respect to the major symbols of Islamic belief established in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah which their heretical <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> was attempting to undermine and characterize as "kufr" and "shirk" on the basis of that conceptual baggage and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. So they began to deny that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (<a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>see here</a>), that He will be seen in the Hereafter with the vision of the eyes, that He speaks as and when He wills, and that He is described with Names, attributes and actions and they began to use that terminology (<i>ajsaam, <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, hawaadith</i>) to fight against the creed of the Muslims, being deceived into thinking that just because they were proving the universe is originated through this language, it was also acceptable in describing Allaah, the Most High in affirmation and negation.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Muslims Be Warned:</b> There are many <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> present today who parade under da'wah organizations claiming to teach "Muslim Apologetics" (how to debate with Atheists and Philosophers) and the heritage of these people is from the heretics of the second century hijrah, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and those of the fifth and sixth centuries, the Ash'aris and Maturidis - who are all one big family, the family of <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (read <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>this article</a>) and all subsequent articles in the series). They are drawing you into that "<i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-kalam</font></a></i>" condemned by the Salaf and the four Imaams (Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Shafi'ee and Ahmad), but they use deception and lies to make you believe otherwise. These are deep and subtle matters and historically, many intelligent, shrewd, righteous Scholars got drawn into this trial of "<a href="tags/ilm-al-kalam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ilm al-kalam</font></a>" and came under its influence. <b>So we advise you to beware and beware again and to protect you deen, eemaan and aqeedah from these people because they are like highway robbers who will rob you of your eemaan and aqeedah through the stealth of night whilst making you believe that you have been enriched and enlighted by the experience!</b></div>    <P>
So with this brief introduction, we will (in the next article) commence our commentary on this lecture and prove and establish that <a href='tags/atabek-shukrov-nasafi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atabek Shukrov Nasafi</font></a> in his position on <i><a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a></i> is following <b>Aristotle bin Nicomachus of Stageira, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus of Alexandria, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of Harraan, <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, al-Ja'd bin Dirham, Bishr al-Mareesee, the Mu'tazilites of Basrah and Baghdad, the Raafidi <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> and others</b> and that he is blatantly dishonest by pretending he is propounding the position of the Salaf in this matter.     <P>
