<div class='sidebar'>The use of the label <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> can be very confusing and often when people use it in discussions and exchanges, they can be referring to different things. It is necessary to clarify what is entered into this label in order to remove that confusion. Reference to <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> in the text refers to the proof that the Ash'aris took from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> [who took it from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who took it from al-Ja'd bin Dirham who took it from the Sabean Philosophers] in order to demonstrate the universe is originated and has a Creator - by arguing that the presence of attributes (sifat) and actions (af'al) in bodies indicates they are events (hawaadith) and thus originated.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Type 1</font>    <P>
<b><u>Group 1: Abu al-Hasan al-Ashari</u></b>    <P>
We have to put Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> <u>in a category on his own</u> because after abandoning the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and adopting the Kullaabi creed, he went through a transition and moved towards the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah and reached the truth in the most affairs by the end of his life. Just like <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>,  <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> did not consider the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory, rather he declared it an innovation and an inferior method to the method of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in his book <i>Risaalah ilaa Al al-Thaghar</i>. In his last works (al-Maqaalaat, al-Ibaanah), He affirmed Allah's 'uluww, <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (face,  two hands, two eyes and so on) and <a href='tags/sifat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (istiwa', nuzul, majee, anger, pleasure and so on) without <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> or tafwid. His direct students such as Abu Abdullah bin Mujahid (~370H), and Abu al-Hasan al-Bahili (~370H), <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a> (d. 380H) and others will have come under this influence, although not much exists from them in terms of literature or reports, this is because unlike the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, they did not author a great deal.    <P>
<u><b>Group 2: Abu Bakr al-Baqillani</b></u>    <P>
We have to put <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> in a separate category because he has something unique. He opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> by elaboratinng upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and declaring it obligatory (al-Ash'ari said it was a bid'ah). However, alongside this proof he still affirmed Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His essence, and He affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah (face, two hands, two eyes) and he is commended for being close to Ahl al-Sunnah in these affairs, despite laying down things which are not from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself.    <P>
<u><b>Group 3: Those Adhering to What is in al-Ibaanah and Labelled Themselves as Ash'aris</b></u>    <P>
There were found historically those who adhered to what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was upon at the end of his life, and they spoke with everything that was in the book <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> and did not oppose it, and they labelled themselves as <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>, even though such a label for oneself is an innovation in the religion. The presence of such factions is proven by <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> (d. 571H)  who defended <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> with respect to his authorship of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> against the charges of deception (taqiyah) and not believing in its contents. The likes of <a href='tags/ibn-darbas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Darbas</font></a> al-Shafi'i (d. 659H) who held onto what is in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> were present in al-Quds in that era, and he has a book defending <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> from the claim that he wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> out of taqiyah and did not wholeheartedly believe in its contents, similar to what was done by <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> There were those who alongside affirming al-Ibaanah were affected by some of al-Asharis earlier books which still retained aspects of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and they considered that all of it was al-Asharis view, and this is an error because in his books al-Luma', Risalah Ilaa Ahl al-Thaghr, al-Mujiz, al-Maqaalaat, al-Ibaanah, we see things that clearly contradict each other, and contradict his Kullabi past, <u>indicating a transition</u> - not that everything in all his books remained from his views.</div>    <P>
Whoever held fast to what is in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> and did not oppose, it no rejection is shown against them except their bid'ah of ascription to <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. For the purpose of terminology we can refer to this as <b>Ibanah-Ash'ariyyah</b> and those who were upon it as Ibanah-Asharis.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Type 2: The Move Towards I'tizaal And Tasawwuf</font>    <P>
Those who moved towards I'tizal in their views, and his started with <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 429H) - he made <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> of 'uluww and al-istwaa and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Likewise <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, he explained away al-'uluww and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, even if he affirmed face, hands and eye for Allah without <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid, and he brought benefit in terms of the field of hadith and reviving the fiqh of al-Shafi'i -  so he has some merit. These particular views of his were because <b>he was strongly affected by the book al-Ibaanah</b>. It is a shame that he did not shake off the effect of his teachers like <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a> a little more.</div>    <P>
Al-Juwayni (d. 478H) completed the affair and took the school well into the road of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Also worthy of mention is <a href='tags/al-qushayri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qushayri</font></a> (d. 465H) who brought in an extreme form of tasawwuf and associated the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> madhhab with it.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Type 3: Philosophy and Zandaqah</font>    <P>
It is here that the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) brought Ash'arism into the throes of greater heresy. They got diseased and ruined by delving into the books of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, such as <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H), the writings of Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi (d. 414H), the Rasaa'il of Ikhwan al-Safaa (Baatiniyyah) and others. And they brought in Gnostic Illumism, Philosophy, and much confusion and heresy. Similarly, Sayf al-Din <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a> (d. 631H) he continued this heritage of zandaqah in opinion and viewpoint taken from <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, and he was someone who used to abandon the prayer (tarik al-salat) as is established about him, and he used to learn philosophy from the Jews and Christians (more on that in a separate article). So this is the era of  falsfah, baatiniyyah and zandaqah which was of greater pollution, beyond the I'tizal of the 5th century.    <P>
We can combine Types 2 and 3 under the term <b><a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a></b>, however we have to exclude <u><a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a></u> from this group as he has such merit that is not warranted for the others.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Type 4: Those Who Lived, Were Raised and Acquired Knowledge in a Period when the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Were Prominent</font>    <P>
These are the likes of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (d. 671H) <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (d 676H), and Ibn Hajar (d. 852H) and they lived in a period when the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> gained strength and prominence in the Muslim lands and few were spared from them and their influence, and when it was difficult to proclaim and manifest the way of the Salaf for reasons that parallel the times when the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had similar strength in the early third century after hiijrah. You had <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics like Ibn Tumart (d. 542H) who claimed he was the awaited mahdi, and imposed the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed with sword, killing tens of thousands of Muslims because he considered them <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for not subscribing to his particular creed. So this was the kind of environment in the 6th-8th centuries with the spread of <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. Ashariyyah was the creed of the day, and Allaah certainly alternates the days between the factions, for how many a state with a deviant creed has come and gone, and this is how it is, Allaah tests some with others. So these scholars were influenced by the prevailing situation. Despite this, in their writings they clearly demonstrated their opposition to some of the foundational principles upon which the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> kalam school is built, and this was by virtue of their attachment to hadeeth. This shows that they did not enter through the same initial primary door as these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. Rather, they entered through the love of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the hadith and their sciences, and as for the Mu'attilah they entered through <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-kalam</font></a>, and due to the dominance of the Ashari school in that time these Scholars were affected and concurred in some of their sayings with those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. But they were influenced to various degrees and their perspective of what the Salaf were upon was through this influence. They are similar to the Hanbali Mufawwidah like <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi <a href="tags/abu-yalaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Abu Ya'laa</font></a></font></a> who had love for hadith and its sciences but followed - with an honest and good intention - certain kalamist views (those of the Kullaabiyyah) which they wrongly thought to be correct. It should be pointed out that even those in this group are not all alike. As for Ibn Hajar then he is mudtarib (confused), sometimes he speaks with the way of the Salaf by adhering to the hadith and other times he is overwhelmed by the madhhab he was raised upon, however, he is certainly not an "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" like al-Baghdadi, <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a> are Ash'aris. <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> rejected some of the core foundations of <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> founded their creed upon, such as the obligation to rationally prove one's belief in Allaah. So it is not correct to say that these later scholars were "Ash'aris" in the sense of those earlier, heavy industrial-strength kalam Ash'aris.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Type NONE: Those to Whom <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is Spuriously Ascribed</font>    <P>
These are Scholars, who for one reason or another, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> found a way to impute "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" (of the second and third type above) to them. To give an example: Abu Uthman al-Sabuni (d. 449H) praised the book <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, but he praised it from the perspective of <b>[Type 1: Group 3]</b> because its contents are in agreement with the aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>NOTE:</b> Remember some <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> do not believe <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> authored <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> in the first place, others are forced to accept he did but try to contest its contents, but they bang their heads on the walls, because what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> affirms in that book is also affirmed by <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and others, particulary in relation to the <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. So its a dead end. But the point is look at how these people operate in using this vague and obscure label of "Ashariyyah."</div>    <P>
Further in the works of al-Sabuni we see him affirming what invalidates the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> kalam school from its very foundations, which are the <a href='tags/sifat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allah's will). This affirmation is diametrically opposed to the core foundation upon which the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrinal school is built (negation of what they call hawaadith).     <P>
Also another reason they might find to impute a scholar with <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is that he might have praised one of the <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> in some respect,like what al-Sabuni stated about Abu Mansur al-Bagdhadi. So this is a flimsy excuse to impute <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> to him.    <P>
Others imputed with <b>[Type 2 and Type 3]</b>  <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> include Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eeli (d. 371H), al-Qayrawaanee (d. 389H), Abu Nu'aym al-Asbahani (d. 430H), <a href='tags/al-khatib-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Khatib al-Baghdadi</font></a> (d. 463H - all of these are Salafi Scholars upon the aqidah of the Salaf. However, the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> use their names in order inflate their numbers in order to deceive the people. Some of these may have associated with <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> upon the basis of what is in al-Ibaanah, which most <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> reject today, either as a forgery or as a book whose contents have been tampered, and for these allegations they have zero proof except sophistries by which they deceive the people (<a href=series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see here</a>)    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How Today's <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Use Trickery and Deception to Call to the Din of the <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
When you have understood the above, and the veil has been lifted, let us now expose how these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are functioning on an operational level.    <P>
The first step is to throw Ibn Hajar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> at you, for obvious reasons, this is the preferred method because these were real scholars, we mean scholars of the religion, of hadith and its sciences, and of tafsir and they did contribute greatly to the Ummah. This is why you will see that most of what they quote when they seek evidence for their <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and ta'til will come from the direction of these scholars. <b>But these scholars are not really <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in the proper sense of the word</b>, as we have established, since to be an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> in the proper sense of the word, in terms of the doctrinal school, a Scholar must:    <P>
<ul><li>Speak with huduth al-ajsaam,   <li>Make al-nadhar wal-istidlaal to be the first obligation,   <li>Speak with al-Razi's universal principle (of putting reason ahead of revelation),   <li>Reject ahaad hadiths in matters of aqidah,   <li>Deny there is wisdom behind Allah's actions,   <li>Argue for resurrection through <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (<a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>)  <li>Speak with al-jabar (disguised as al-kasb),   <li>Claim eeman is merely tasdiq alone,   <li>Claim Allah is perpetually recreating the entire creation at every indivisible instant of time (yes, in other words, by the time you've blinked once, the entire creation has been recreated by Allaah perhaps a billion times!) </ul>    <P>
And so on.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So what they do is use Ibn Hajar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> as the first veil or cover for what they are really upon which is a hybridization between <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, tajahhum, i'tizal and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a>. What they are attempting is to conceal the zandaqah that was with <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, and al-Amidee who really solidified and laid down what al-Ashariyyah is today. So When the names of these scholars (Ibn Hajar etc.) are mentioned a lot of people are deceived, especially considering that because of the influence that came upon them in the era they lived we see a kalamist perspective of what the Salaf were upon coming through in their writings. So the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are able to effectively spin what has come from the Salaf, through what these scholars genuinely believed to be what the Salaf were upon even though they were mistaken in that regard and their statements are contradicted by what is clearly reported from hundreds of the Salaf on issues such as al-'Uluww, al-Istiwaa' and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, of affirmation (ithbat) with negation of tashbih and takyif - NOT presumption of tashbih followed by <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> of tafwid.</div>    <P>
But their aim here is to conceal the engine <b>[Type 2 and Type 3]</b> which is behind the cover and is actually comprised of <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>. It is that Jahmi, I'tizali, Falsafi hybridization which todays <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon in reality. This engine has be concealed, and its like the engine under the bonnet, you just see the nice appearance of the car, as for its mechanical function, it is hidden. Same thing here. You have to remember that <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid are simply mechanisms through which the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have to maintain conformity with the proof of huduth al-ajsam.     <P>
So in the books of those who make up the engine you see them outlining this proof, having followed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in that, and adhering to its necessities [Allah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>,  not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in makan, not in tahayyuz, not in the universe, not outside of it and so on, which is the negative theology of the Sabean Philosophers] but as for the mechanism to maintain the sanctity of that proof and abide by its necessities they found utility in the likes of Ibn Hajar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, who - even if they were affected by <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid - they were not upon that foundational baatil at all, in fact they spoke against it <a href=index8c76.html?ublmv>as we have documented elsewhere on this site</a>. They were affected with the <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> or tafwid purely because of circumstantial reasons to do with the place and age they lived in.     <P>
So through this, the Talbis of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is unveiled.   <P>
