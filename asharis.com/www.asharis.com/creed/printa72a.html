<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>You never ceased to be amazed at these people present today who gather quotes as if they are lost $100 bills scattered on the ground, post them on blogs and forums, and then testify against themselves through this action that they don't have two brain-cells between their ears, are a manifestation of pure stupidity, do nothing but blindly-follow, and earn many a great sin for themselves. We previously discussed the antics of an intellectual fraudster on the issue of al-Ash'ari's al-Ibaanah (<a href=series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see the series here</a>), and these people, when they  get sick of flogging one dead horse (having been in turn flogged), they move on to the next, hoping to continue their deception. You have to understand that most of these people are compound ignoramuses who have had their brains fried, and they actually understand or know very little about the inner workings of their own <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (or Maturidi) creeds. The most they have learned is some flashy decorative lingo, but beyond that its a sad type of hollowness in the middle. We are going to illustrate the stupidity of these people, so sit tight ...</div>    <P>
The same snotty-nosed Jahmee kid we dealt with in a previous incident (<a href=series/the-authentication-of-al-ibaanah.html>see the series here</a>), where GF Haddaad had fed them rotten leftovers and then did a runner when their nappies needed changing - well he is back with another caper. He's posted a series of quotes regarding <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a>, to misrepresent his creed. We dealt with the issue of the two al-Tamimi's (Abu al-Fadl, and Rizqullaah), who are kalam-influenced <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, who wrongly characterized Imaam Ahmad's creed through paraphrasing (without direct citation through isnaad) what <u>they believed</u> was Imaam's Ahmad's view. Now, the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> trying to pull of this fraud know inside their souls that its hard to make this stuff stick, and that is why they cited these narrations with associated language that indicates as such.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In the <a href=index3c1b.html?pbtfl>first part</a> we looked at how these people spuriously tried to attribute the language of <u>the condemned 'ilm al-kalaam</u> through the <u>al-Tamimis</u> (Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi and his son, Rizqullah al-Tamimi) who came 150 years at least after <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and they could not establish any of this innovated language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (from Ahmad) through any of the well known associates and students of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> like <u>al-Khallaal</u>, <u>Abu Dawud al-Sijistaani</u>, <u>Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee</u> and others.    <P>
In this article we will be looking at narrations which are established from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> but through which the pseudo-Ash'arites attempt to misattribute a certain orientation in creed to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>.</div>     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imam Ahmad on the Issue of 'al-Hadd'</font>    <P>
Today we are going to look at the other narrations pertaining to the issue of 'al-Hadd' which  they cited and which are indeed traced to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. Firstly, for the record we are going to quote their citation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Al-Khallal reports from Imam Ahmad:    <P>
All&#257;h has a <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> has carriers carrying it while All&#257;h is on His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> although He has no limit, and All&#257;h knows best its limit. [Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Aq&#299;da Riwayata Ab&#299; Bakr al-Khall&#257;l, ed. Abd al-Az&#299;z Izz al-D&#299;n al-Sayrawan (Damascus: D&#257;r Qutayba, 1988) p. 78.]    <P>
Hanbal ibn Ish&#257;q, the Im&#257;m's cousin reports from Imam Ahmad: All&#257;h is not to be described more than whatever He described Himself with, or His Prophet described Him with, without limit nor delimitation (bil&#257; h.addin wal&#257; gh&#257;ya) [Narrated by Ibn Qud&#257;ma in Dhamm al-Ta'w&#299;l (p. 20 #32)]    <P>
and also via Hanbal, We believe that All&#257;h is on <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in the manner He wishes and however He wishes, without limit nor description anyone could give or define Him by.

and, in commentary of the verse "And He is with you wheresoever you may be (57:4): [I.e.] His knowledge. His knowledge encompasses all, and our Lord is over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without limit (bil&#257; h.add) nor description. [Narrated by al-Dhahab&#299; cf. Mukhta.sar al-'Uluw (p. 190 #229) and by al-L&#257;lik&#257;&#299;.]</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Aim (of Deception and Hypocrisy) Behind the Use of These Narrations</font>    <P>
And this is known by:    <P>
<blockquote>The greatest obstacle to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of old and of all ages, is the belief that Allaah Himself is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. This is the greatest of what clashes with their proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies) which they took from the Sabean star and idol worshippers (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>), and since this belief is from the fitrah and is ingrained into the human psyche, it is the greatest of what they attempt to erase from the hearts and minds of the people. Because of this proof of huduth al-ajsaam, they consider the belief that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to be an invalidation of Islam itself! Why, because it clashes with their proof. And everything must conform to their proof, including the texts of the Book and the Sunnah. Hence, did they innovate tahreef (calling it ta'weel). The Salaf were wise to them when they first emerged (<a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>see these ten quotes to understand the reality</a>). To this end, they were not able to directly challenge this belief since it is deeply-rooted in the hearts and minds of all of creation (from those who fitrah remained intact), let alone the Muslims and because of this they started raising doubts and issues, around subsidiary issues. They started saying, "Does Allaah leave <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> when He descends?" (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>) in order to create dubiosities and confuse the people. However, as the Salaf pointed out, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> did not even believe there was a Lord above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with, such that they should be entitled to raise such questions in the first place.     <P>
So we see that this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> ancestry has continued in this vain until today where we have their 21st century offspring hiding under the label of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>", when they have nothing to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> or <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> or the very early Kullaabis and Ash'aris, rather they are disputants to them, as they are to the Salaf, all of whom affirmed Allaah's 'uluww. Hence, we see them raising this particular issue of "hadd" and bringing issues in order to confuse and deceive the people. These <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> <b>DO NOT</b> believe Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with. When that is the case, then for them to use these narrations is fraud, because these narrations only come into play if you actually accept and believe that indeed, Allaah Himself, with His essence, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.</blockquote>     <P>
So these people have no right to scavenge like hyenas for quotes from our Scholars to whom they are disputants in the first place in this matter. Hence, the reader will understand what is going on here, and this will become very clear when you read what follows inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Meaning of Hadd and Tahdeed</font>    <P>
From the outset, it would make things easier if we simply clarified the meanings of hadd and tahdeed, so that we are well-equipped to understand the quotes and pursuing discussion.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><u>The meaning of hadd</u>:    <P>
<blockquote>The partition (al-haajiz) between two things such that one does not extend, merge, mix (yakhtalit) into the other. That by which one thing is distinguished from another in terms of its existent reality (qadr) and description (sifah).</blockquote>    <P>
Refer to the dictionary books, <i>Tahdhib al-Lughah</i> of al-Azhari, <i>Mu'jam Maqaayees al-Lughah</i> of Ibn Faaris, <i>al-Sihaah</i> of al-Jawhari, <i>al-Qamus al-Muheet</i>  of al-Fayrozabadi, and <i>Taj al-Uroos</i> of al-Zubaydee.</div>    <P>
The word 'hadd' is commonly used in the speech of the Salaf to mean 'definition', and this is also the meaning of tahdeed (to define, give a definition). And there are words that are used in a similar context such as tafseer, <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, all of which relate to giving meaning, interpretation, definition to something.   When we understand this, we will grasp many of these quotes that come from these Scholars in both <u>affirmation and negation</u> of hadd, because they are used in two different contexts as we will explain.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding The Deen of the <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
It is also necessary for us to establish the reality of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> with some historical fact, and this can be achieved by the following:    <P>
<blockquote>When the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> came along they denied 'hadd' for Allaah and what they meant is that <u>Allaah cannot be described with anything</u> which distinguishes Him from what is besides Him in terms of description, definition, and such that He can be said to actually exist. Likewise in terms of His essence (dhaat), they were saying that Allaah is everywhere with His essence, just as they were rejecting that Allaah could be described with anything, so He is not hearing, seeing, speaking and so on and nor is His essence distinguishable from what is besides it. And we see refutations against them by all the well-known Imaams of the Sunnah including Ibn al-Mubaarak and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and Ishaaq bin Raahuyah, affirming that He is indeed separate and distinct from the creation with His essence, and likewise He is indeed defined through whatever He revealed of names, attributes and actions. Thus, it was from the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> to reject hadd and tahdeed (definition) for Allaah from these angles. This [denial of hadd in this manner] was from the greatest of the hallmarks of the deen of the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. <u>It was in fact the very asl of their kufr</u>. Once this context is clear - and this is well known to anyone who has bothered to even read, study and understand the nature of the debate between these <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> kaafirs and the people of hadith, sunnah and aathaar - then all the sayings and writings of the Scholars will be clearly understood. To grasp this, when we say what is the hadd of a human, we say he is "<i>hearing (samee'), seeing (baseer), living (hayy), speaking (mutakallim), able (qaadir)</i>." So this is the hadd for a man, meaning the definition, how is he defined, or rather what we have mentioned is part of the hadd (definition) of a man since it is not comprehensive and can include other things. Does Allaah have a hadd? Yes, otherwise <u>He simply would not exist</u>. From it is that which we know because Allaah has informed us of it. Allaah is "<i>hearing (samee'), seeing (baseer), living (hayy), speaking (mutakallim), able (qaadir)</i>." So this is what is meant by "hadd" and this is what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were rejecting, they wanted to reject the ascription of attributes to Allaah (to avoid giving definition to Him which would establish that He is an existing entity, self-established, described with attributes), because they wanted to reject differentiating Him from his creation in His essence. And it is well known and reported by the Salaf, just as <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> mentions in his Maqaalaat (1/312, 1950 edition), that al-Jahm refused to say Allaah is "a thing (shay')." This is because this would have given Allaah a hadd, meaning, a definition through which His existence is necessitated and through which <u>He is distinguished</u> from what is besides Him (of all other things) in His existent reality and description, and this was rejected by these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. Now whoever knows the works of the Salaf and their statements explaining the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and has read and studied them will know this for sure. And whoever grasps the above, will understand exactly where <u>Imaam al-Daarimee</u> (rahimahullaah) was coming from when he pounded that Jahmee Kaafir called Bishr al-Mareesee and his tail-end follower, who was rejecting "hadd" for Allaah, with a view to denying his distinct existence, denying He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and claiming He is in all places. O and how <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> al-Maturidi laments and grieves that this Jahmee Kaafir and gross Mujassim was annihilated in the way that he was by an Imaam from the Imaams of Sunnah and Hadeeth.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">But these poor pseudo-Ash'aris <u>don't study that kind of history</u>, it takes them too far out of that psychological comfort zone, (called <u>Play School</u> and <u>Rainbow</u>) and into that big nasty world of ... yes, <b>REALITY</b>. Darn, how evil <b>REALITY</b> is! Why do we have to abandon <u>Bungle</u> and <u>Zippy</u> and instead, start making objective readings of the aqidah books from the first 300 years hijrah (<a href=indexfc13.html?zycga>such as those listed in this PDF</a>)! It's just not fair!</font></blockquote></div>    <P>
From another angle, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (Mu'attilah), and the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were also present, and they would start giving explanations (tafsirs) and interpretations (ta'weels) and definitions (tahdeeds), either to negate the attributes, or to make takyif of them by giving a definition (tahdeed, hadd) which itself has not come in the Book and the Sunnah. This is like saying for example that Allaah "fills the Throne" or is "the same size as <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or smaller or bigger", or saying "hearing like my hearing" or "life like my life". All of this is <i>tahdeed</i> and <i>hadd</i> which is baseless. So here tahdeed and hadd means to give additional definitions which the Book and the Sunnah have not come with, and this is also intended in the speech of the Scholars when they rejected hadd, tahdeed, and hudud. </blockquote>    <P>
So these two usages of <i>hadd</i> and <i>tahdeed</i> and <i>hudud</i> should be plain and  manifest to you and if you read the books of the Salaf and their rejection against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, will see that these were the matters in dispute. What these confused <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are falling into then is that they clearly do not understand what these statements mean or for what purpose the word hadd is being used for, either in negation or affirmation.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>More Clarity from Hanbal bin Ishaaq</font>    <P>
To help you grasp this, consider this very valuable and informative quote from Hanbaal bin Ishaaq (this is taken from our publication, "<b>The Creed of the Early Kullaabi Ash'aris</b>" and <a href=index291b.html?vxilx>an excerpt</a> on this topic <a href=index291b.html?vxilx>can be read here</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I asked  Ab&#363; &#703;Abd All&#257;h about the &#257;&#7717;&#257;d&#299;th which report that All&#257;h,  the Blessed and Exalted, descends to the lowest heaven, and that All&#257;h will be seen, and that All&#257;h will place His foot [in the Hellfire] and what is similar to these &#257;&#7717;&#257;d&#299;th, so Ab&#363; &#703;Abd All&#257;h said:     <P>
<blockquote>We believe in them, we affirm them,  there is no kayf, and no ma&#703;n&#257;, and we do not reject anything from them. And we know that whatever has come from the Messenger is the truth if it has come with authentic chains of narration. And we do not reject the saying of All&#257;h, and All&#257;h, the Blessed and Exlated, is not described with more than what He has described Himself, without &#7717;add and gh&#257;yah. </blockquote>    <P>
There is none like Him in His essence, just as He described Himself, and He, the Blessed and Exalted, mentioned the attribute for Himself, <b>and so He defined the attribute for Himself (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1581;&#1583; &#1604;&#1606;&#1601;&#1587;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1601;&#1577;</span>) which nothing resembles</b>. Hence, we worship All&#257;h [who has these] attributes, <b>they are not defined (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1581;&#1583;&#1608;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) or known <u>except</u> through what He described Himself with</b>.  All&#257;h, the Blessed and Exalted said, "<b>And He is the all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b>" (42:10), <u>without &#7717;add  (definition) or taqd&#299;r (estimation, consideration)</u>, and those who describe are not able to reach description (of Him) [except with what He Himself has described]... We believe in all of the Qur&#702;&#257;n, that which is definitive (mu&#7717;kam) from it and that which is ambiguous (mutash&#257;bih), and we do not cease (affirming) an attribute from His attributes due to any repugnance that is displayed ... all of this shows that All&#257;h will be seen in the Hereafter, and making ta&#7717;d&#299;d (defining in words) in this matter is an innovation. <b>It is a matter of making tasl&#299;m (submission) to All&#257;h with His command, without any [further] description  (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1589;&#1601;&#1577;</span>) or definition (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1581;&#1583;</span>), except with what All&#257;h describe Himself with</b>. He is hearing, seeing, He never ceased to be one who speaks, knowing, forgiving, knower of the unseen and seen, knower of all that is hidden. These attributes that He has described Himself with are not to be rejected or repelled, and He is upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without &#7717;add (definition), just as the Exalted said, "<b>Then He ascended over the Throne</b>" (7:54), however He willed, the will (mash&#299;'ah ) belongs to Him, the Mighty and Majestic, and all ability lies with Him,  there is no likeness unto Him, and He is the creator of everything, <b>and He is just as He described Himself, hearing, seeing, without &#7717;add (definition) or taqd&#299;r (estimation, consideration)</b>.  And He,the Exalted said, quoting the saying of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m to his father, "<b>Why do you worship that which does not hear nor see?</b>" (19:42). So it is established that All&#257;h is hearing, seeing. Thus, His attributes are from Him, we do not go beyond the Qur&#702;&#257;n and the &#7717;ad&#299;th. And the narration pertaining to All&#257;h's laughter, we do not know how that is unless [it comes through an] affirmation (ta&#7779;d&#299;q) of the Messenger and affirmation (tathb&#299;t) of the Qur&#702;&#257;n, hence, those who describe cannot describe it, and nor can anyone define it (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;</span>), exalted is All&#257;h from what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>  say. I said to him: The <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, what do they say? He said: Whoever says seeing like my seeing, hand like my hand - [and &#7716;anbal said in another place] - foot like my foot, then he has likened All&#257;h to His creation, and this one has defined it (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1610;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607;</span>), and this is evil speech, and this has now been defined (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1581;&#1583;&#1608;&#1583;</span>), and I do not like speech in this matter. &#703;Abd All&#257;h said, "They stripped the Qur&#702;&#257;n [of its mention of attributes for All&#257;h]." And the Prophet (&#7779;allall&#257;hu alayhi wa sallam) said, "He will place His foot [in Hellfire]", we believe in it and we do not define it (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1606;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607;</span>), and nor do we reject [this] from the Messenger of All&#257;h (&#7779;allall&#257;hu alayhi wa sallam), rather we believe in it. All&#257;h, the Blessed and Exalted said, "<b>And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he prohibits you from, then withhold from it</b>" (59:7). And All&#257;h, the Mighty and Majestic, has ordered us to take whatever he came with, and to withhold from what he prohibited, and His names and attributes are uncreated, and we seek refuge in All&#257;h from slips and doubts, indeed He is powerful over all things  </blockquote>    <P>
When you read this statement you understand exactly what is meant by hadd, tahdeed, mahdud in the language of these scholars. We suggest you read this and re-read it five times before continuing, seriously. And note how "hadd" has been mentioned also in relation to the attributes of hearing and seeing and others. There is great benefit in it in terms of grasping how the Salaf are using these words.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Sidenote:</b> We feel really sorry for the poor people who are having their minds played with. We do not have anything personal against the average "wannabe" <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>. He is our brother and just a sincere person misled by the devils amongst men who in turn are ignorant too in reality (pretending to have knowledge) but are also diseased with evil intentions (as is clear from their actions). We pray to Allaah that Allaah guides and delivers those who are sincere from the snares of the devils amongst them. So from the greatest of travesties is that these people quote statements from the Scholars <b>without <u>ANY</u> understanding</b> whatsoever about <u>what they actually mean</u>. As we said early, they've just picked up what is <u>to them</u> some flashy theological lingo, they don't really know what any of it means, and its simply used to beautify their blogs and forums and to stupefy the audience.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Corroborating These Quotes and Explaining Their Meanings</font>    <P>
As we have said before, <u>never, never, ever, ever</u> trust a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> in citation. This is a solid fundamental rule. Go and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>take a look at this clown</a> (GF Haddaad) to see exactly what we mean. I mean we are not even talking about oversight, or stroppiness. We are talking <u>hardcore calculated deception</u>. And then <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>take a look at this jester over here</a> (<a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>). We are talking about persisting upon a fraud after being caught stinking red-handed. So when this is state of their leaders, what, pray tell, do you think will be the state and condition of the blind-followers?! So the first  rule is corroborate the quotes yourself.     <P>
So we say that indeed <u>both affirmation and negation</u> of "<b>hadd</b>" has been related from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, just as its affirmation has been narrated from other Imaams of the Salaf, and they all have a context. So we can now proceed to these quotes, along with comments.    <P>
Imaam Ahmad said, through the narration of Hanbal:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We believe that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, however He wills, and as He wills without a hadd (bilaa haddin) and nor a description (wa laa sifah) which one describing can reach, or which anyone can define (yuhidduhu ahad).</blockquote>    <P>
And through al-Marroodhee:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It is reported from Ibn al-Mubaarak that it was said to him, "How do we know our Lord?" He said, "Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with a hadd." He (<a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>) said, "That reached me" and it surprised him.</blockquote>    <P>
And Abu Ya'laa also brings through Abu Dawud al-Sijistaani:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>A man came to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a> and said, "Does Allaah the Blessed and Exalted have a hadd?" He said, "Yes, none knows it except for He."</blockquote>    <P>
He also quotes from Abu Bakr al-Athram:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It was said to him (Ahmad): It is quoted from Ibn al-Mubaarak that he said, "Our Lord is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with a hadd". So Ahmada said, "Likewise, this is how it is with us."</blockquote>    <P>
The above quotes are from Abu Ya'laa's <i>Ibtaal al-Ta'weelaat</i>. And al-Khall&#257;l also reports with his isn&#257;d from Muhammad bin Ibr&#257;h&#299;m al-Qays&#299;, who said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I said to Ahmad bin Hanbal, 'It is narrated about Ibn al-Mub&#257;rak that it was said to him, 'How do we know our Lord?' and he replied, 'Above (f&#299;) the seventh heaven, upon His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with a demarcation (bi haddin)''. So Ahmad said, 'This is how it is with us'</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comments On These Quotes:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>The first quote negates any definition (hadd) or description (sifah) as to how Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. This would refute what some of the Ahl al-Kalaam, the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> fell into in giving tahdeed (definition) for how Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. We only speak with Allaah informed us, that He indeed (Himself) is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and we give no further hadd, or sifah unless it is from the Book and Sunnah itself. Thus to say "He is touching the throne" or "He fills the Throne" or "He extends beyond <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> extends beyond Him", all of this is hadd, and sifah which is prohibited.     <P>
And as for what is related through Ibn al-Mubaarak, which <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> did not reject, rather, he affirmed it, as occurs in the other narration, and spoke of it himself, then that is a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> separate and distinct with His essence from all of the creation, including His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. So we have two different categories of people being addressed. The Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (who said Allaah is in all places) and those who, after affirming Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (in agreement with Ahl al-Sunnah and the early Kullaabis and early Ash'aris),  starting giving a hadd (definition) and sifah (description) which has no basis in the Book and the Sunnah.</blockquote>    <P>
And then we also have narrations from Harb in Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee, in his Masaa'il <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, which are reported also in <i>Dhamm al-Kalaam</i> of Abu Isma'eel al-Harawi, with his isnaads. So from them:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It was said to Ishaq bin Raahuyah [d. 238H], "What do you say regarding the saying of Allaah, '<b>There is no secret counsel of three except that He is the fourth</b>'?" (58:7). He said, "Wherever you are, He is closer to you than the jugular vein, and [alongside that] He is separate and distinct from His creation." I [the narrator] said to Ishaaq, "Over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with a hadd?" He said, "Yes, with a hadd."</blockquote>    <P>
And al-Harawi also cites the narration from Ibn al-Mubaarak with his isnaad:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, separate and distinct from His creation, with a hadd.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comments On These Quotes:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>These two statements from these two Imaams are in relation to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who did not distinguish between Allah and His creation and said Allaah is in all things, in all places, and just as He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, He is also in the heavens and earth. Thus, the Imaams made this statement to counter this statement of kufr. Note that the use of the word hadd is used specifically in relation to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> for this particular meaning being discussed, which is Allah is separate and distinct from His creation. But in a more wider sense, when not tied to al-istiwaa' and al-'uluww, but general, hadd means "definition", as in to define something for Allaah, along the lines we have already discussed earlier in the article.      <P>
Now when you see in the writings of the likes of al-Daarimee, refuting that other Jahmee kaafir known as al-Bishr al-Mareesee [and we often see in the books of these Maturidis and Ash'aris lamenting for this Bishr al-Mareesee, siding with him, being affectionate towards him, considering him oppressed and wronged] - he too rejected hadd for Allaah as he inherited this from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and this is the angle of refutation against this gross Mujassim and Mushabbih (al-Mareesee) who claimed Allaah is in all places. Look at that fake piety, "we are absolving Allaah of makaan and hadd", and at the same time this Jahmee Kaafir believes Allaah is in all places!! So when you see Imaam al-Daarimee refuting this Jahmee Kaafir and establishing that Allaah indeed has a hadd (as in He is separate and distinct from His creation) - then we only complain to Allaah of the sickness in heart and mind of the one who then comes and sides with Bishr al-Maresee al-Jahmee al-Kaafir and scorns Imaam al-Daarimee for speaking with what <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, Ishaq bin Rahuyah and Ibn al-Mubaarak expressed for the same reason!</blockquote>    <P>
Then there are other narrations too. From them is the statement of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> as occurs in the Risaalah of al-Istikhree which is cited by Ibn Abee Ya'laa in the Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah (1/61):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And All&#257;h, the Mighty and Majestic is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> has carriers which carry it and All&#257;h the Mighty and Majestic is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, there is no &#7717;add for Him (in this regard), and All&#257;h knows best of his own &#7717;add.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comments On This Quote:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>The hadd referred to here is not in relation to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but in relation to Allaah  Himself. Refer to the earlier quote from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> narrated through Abu Dawud al-Sijistaanee. This statement here appears to negate hadd and affirm it, and what it actually means is that there is no hadd (definition, explanation) as to how Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>  so there is no hadd to be made in this regard and no hadd (definition, explanation) has been revealed in the texts, and thus, Allaah knows best about this hadd (i.e. its definition, explanation, how it is), as in how He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Discussion, Closing Notes</font>    <P>
When you see Ash'aris, Maturidis zealously posting quotes from our Sunni, Salafi, Athari scholars about whose meanings they don't have a clue about <b>[because they were made in a polemical landscape against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Ahl al-Kalaam - which these people never understand because the first 300 years is not a good period for them or their belief, and hence their study of the actual aqidah of the Salaf from those books written in that time is scant or non-existent]</b>, then just take a minute of your time and ask Allaah to guide those poor souls. We indeed ask Allaah to guide them and save them from the snares of devils amongst them, Ameen. It's sad to see these people so lost.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>What is really going on here, is that these people are simply playing around with embellished and beautified slogans and words, its all on the surface. It's like a beautiful looking car, shiny, sporty, stylish and from its appearance you think there's going to be a V8 engine under the bonnet that's going to be burning some serious rubber. But when you actually lift the bonnet, there is nothing there, not even an engine, let alone a V8. All you see is loose wires, empty cereal packets, used plastic milk bottles, black bin liners, and all types of other trash all scrumpled together where the engine ought to be. So there is no engine, which means this thing sure looks good, but it ain't moving. Meanwhile, the onlookers marvel at its external beauty, and lavish it with praises, and little do they know that its practically useless.      <P>
And this is really what these people have, they have flashy language on the surface, beautified phrases and expressions, but underneath it, there's nothing. Nothing of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, no understanding, and its practically useless. So what if you've posted narrations about "hadd"? Can you actually tell us what they really mean? Do you even have any understanding of history and of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and of the true aqidah of the Imaams of the Salaf - i.e. something of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> - such that you can actually explain to your audience why these statements were made and what they mean and to whom they were addressed, such that your audience has actually benefitted and actually understood something? Or is just mere show to stupefy and bewilder the audience in order to bolster your own image and your own corrupt aqidah which is based upon what you inherited from the <u>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</u> who beat you to this type of theological rhetoric (<u><i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, bodies and accidents</u>) by at least a few hundred to almost a thousand years (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>read this series here</a>)? And then all you  can do to embellish that corrupt aqidah of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and tahreef, to make it look good, is to misappropriate, steal and plunder the statements of <u>OUR</u> Imaams, our Scholars, our Shaykhs who have absolutely nothing to do with you [Ahl al-Bid'ah] and your theology based upon <i>al-a'raad wal-ajsaam</i> and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>, rather they are free and innocent of you and deep inside your souls, you know for sure that if you were present in their time (with your language in theology), <b>it would either be <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?ecqjj>the sandal</a> or it would be  <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?jrldk>the prison</a></b>(!)</blockquote></div>    <P>
So let the reader beware that this type of activity is nothing but a confidence trick, its all a hype, a swindle, and they are trying to steal your brains and your creed (and even your money) all at the same time!    <P>
