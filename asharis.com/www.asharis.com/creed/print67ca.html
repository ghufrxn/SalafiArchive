Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee (d. 258H) is one of the great Scholars of the Salaf, he was the Shaykh of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, who both took hadeeth from him, as did Abu Daawood and an-Nasaa'ee and Ibn Khuzaimah (d. 311H) and others. And from those whom he reached and heard from amongst the great Imaams were Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee, Wakee' bin al-Jarraah, Yahyaa al-Qattaan, Yazeed bin Haaroon.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/diyaa-maqdisi-ikhtisaas-ul-quraan.gif align=right hspace=8 border=1 border=0> And he lived in the time when the likes of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> (from whom the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> took their creed) reared their heads after <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> had subdued the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their saying that the Qur'aan is created. Abdullaah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab (d. 240H) and Husayn al-Karaabeesee (d. 248H) were two Innovators, the first innovated the doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" and the second innovated the statement "My recitation of the Qur'aan is created" - and the rejection of the Salaf was severe against them, as is known and documented.    <P>
These two individuals are the predecessors of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. From the greatest of intellectual frauds that <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> perpetrate in contemporary times is to claim or deceptively portray that their saying regarding Allaah's Speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the very saying of the Salaf. And this fraud has been uncovered elsewhere in this site, <a href=series/the-jahmite-asharis-on-the-speech-of-allah-the-quran-and-kalam-nafsee.html>see this series of articles for more information</a>.    <P>
In "Iktisaas ul-Quran bi Awdihi Ilaa ar-Raheem ar-Rahmaan" of Diyaa ud-Deen al-Maqdisi (d. 634H) - a book bringing together the ahaadeeth and narrations pertaining to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being erased from this Earth and returning to Allaah, he brings - with an authentic (saheeh) chain of narration - the statement of Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/diyaa-maqdisi-ikhtisaas-ul-quraan-no-16.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever claims that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things, or that the Qur'aan is a hikaayah (quotation), then he is, by Allaah, besides whom there is none worthy of worship, a zindeeq (heretic), kaafir (disbeliever) in Allaah.  This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the [very] <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah revealed upon the tongue of Jibreel, upon Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). It it is not changed or altered. "<b>Falsehood cannot reach it from in front nor from behind, it is a revelation (tanzeel) [sent down] from the all-Wise, all-Praiseworthy</b>" [41:42], as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said: "<b>Say: If [the whole of ] mankind and the jinn gathered together to bring a like of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they would not be able to bring a like of it, even if they were helpers to one another</b>." (al-Israa 17:88)    <P>
And if a man swore an oath that he will not speak today, then he recited the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or prayed, reciting the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (therein), or made salutation in the prayer, he would not have broken his oath. Nothing is to be analogised with the Speech of Allaah. The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, it began with Him (i.e. He spoke it), and to Him will it return. Nothing from Allaah is created, neither and nor are His Attributes, nor His Names, nor His Knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
  <font class='titleHeadline'>Comments and Notes</font>    <P>
There are many important points from the saying of this Imaam that are not to be passed by:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever claims that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things, or that the Qur'aan is a hikaayah (quotation)...</blockquote>    <P>
A few points regarding this:    <P>
<ul><li>The verifier of the treatise states in his footnote to the above quotation the following issues: That the one who said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things was Dawud adh-Dhaahiree (d. 270H), meaning that there is a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that was revealed and one that was not revealed, and others agreed with him on that from his contemporaries and those who came after. And that the first of those who said it is a "hikaayah", a quotation, was Abdullaah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab (d. 240H), who is the chief of the Kullaabis, he said this in order to corroborate the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (present with us) is created and that it is the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (meaning present with Allaah's self from eternity) that is uncreated. In saying this he afffirmed for Allaah an attribute that Allaah is not described with ("<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", a singular eternal meaning), and negated from Allaah the attribute He is described with ("<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>", as it is correctly known and defined in the language). And that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (d. 324H) came after him, agreed with <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, but said that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is an "ibaarah" (expression) of that "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", and this saying is worse than the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>.    <P>
<li>The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> too say that "<u>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things</u>", for they hold that there is a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is not revealed and which is with Allaah (the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, singular, indivisible meaning, present with Allaah) and that there is a created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have present with us, which is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in letter and word as we have it. </ul>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> ... then he is, by Allaah, besides whom there is none worthy of worship, a <u>zindeeq</u> (heretic), <u>kaafir</u> (disbeliever) in Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
There are a number of points from this saying of al-Waasitee:    <P>
<ul><li> Takfir of anyone who claimed the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things, or that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is merely a "hikaayah" - this is takfir of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> - whilst noting that there is a difference between takfir bil-wasf (attaching takfeer to a belief, saying or action) and takfir bil-ayn (making takfir of a specific individual), and this statement does not necessitate specific takfir of everyone who speaks with the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (or the Ash'arites) - since these people hold this view upon a faulty <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (interpretation and understanding), thinking they are purifying Allaah of deficiencies and defects. It is not until this faulty <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is removed and explained and a person then persists upon this saying of kufr, that takfir is made. And the Salaf were wise to the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Karaabeesee and others who were protecting the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created because these people (Ibn Kullaab, al-Karaabeesee) were <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> who were upon that intellectual proof of demonstrating the universe is created (to prove a creator) through the use of the language, terminology and classifications of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves, and this is the "Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-Arad" - the "Tawheed of Aristotle's <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and Incidental Attribute". For an explanation of this see the next point.    <P>
<li> The <u>intellectual fraud</u> committed by contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> in claiming that the differences regarding the issues of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> were only differences specifically between Ahmad bin Hanbal (d. 241H) and the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Karaabeesee and others. And this is false, rather the difference was between <u>the entirety of the Salaf</u> and those who inherited the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said this in order not to invalidate the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and trying to purify Allaah of "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) so as not to render Him a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). And they (the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) said this because they are all agreed that Allaah cannot be described with actions that are tied to His will and power (sifaat fi'liyyah, <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> ikhtiyaariyyah). This is the actual root and origin of the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is created, and all of this follows on from this intellectual proof of theirs called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - which they all made to be the very foundation of the religion of Islaam itself. To learn more about this, pop into our support group, <a href='tags/aristotelians-anonymous.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelians Anonymous</font></a>, <a href=index6f5c.html?brner >here</a> and <a href=index27ca.html?mrgly>here</a>. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah are all agreed with each other that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have with us, in letter and word, recited, heard, memorized, written, is created. Thereafter, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah only <u>feign and pretend</u> to oppose their ancestors (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) on this issue with plays with words and definitions. We have uncovered this fraud with much detail already in previous articles from their own books - <a href=series/the-jahmite-asharis-on-the-speech-of-allah-the-quran-and-kalam-nafsee.html>see this series of articles for more information</a>, and particularly the articles on <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, al-Buti, <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> and al-Bayjuri.</ul>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the [very] <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah revealed upon the tongue of Jibreel, upon Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). </blockquote>    <P>
A number of points regarding this:    <P>
<ul><li> This is the saying of the entirety of the Salaf, that there is only one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and it is all the same - whether written in the Preserved Tablet (as the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allaah's knowledge, in that Allaah knows, from eternity, what He will say and speak with), or spoken by Allaah, or heard by Jibreel, or spoken by Jibreel, or heard by Muhammad (alayhis salaam), or memorized by Muhammad or recited by Muhammad, or heard by the Companions, or memorized by them in their hearts, or written on parchments, scrolls, and in the copies of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> - all of that is a single <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And anyone who claimed that anything from that was created - which was the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - then the Salaf made takfir of them (whilst noting the difference between takfir bil-wasf and takfir bil-ayn). And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> did not intend by their saying that "<i>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>" that the ink and paper and voices of the servants when they recite are created, as this was already known, understood and accepted. Rather they meant the words of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that which is being recited (the words uttered by the tongue and not the utterance of the tongue itself), the words being heard (conveyed through the voice and not the voice itself), that this is created. And they said this because they rejected that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, such that He can speak when He wills, as He wills, however He wills, as this amounts to "hawaadith" (events, occurrences), which can only take place in bodies (ajsaam), as per Aristotle's al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar, and they could not accept this for Allaah.     <P>
<li> So when we see the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> saying there are two Qur'ans, and not a singular <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then they say this only to support the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is indeed created and cannot be the speech of Allaah except "metaphorically". <u>This is the kufr that the Salaf spoke of and for for which they made takfir of the Jahmiyyah</u>. However, whilst this saying is kufr, due to the intricate nature of this issue, most <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> do not recognized the kufr they are speaking with and thus, we do not make takfir of them unless and until the shubhah (confusion, doubt) is removed and they understand the reality of what the Salaf were upon and the reality of what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were upon and then persist upon their misguidance, deliberately opposing what is manifest and clear from the Salaf.  </ul>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It it is not changed or altered. "<b>Falsehood cannot reach it from in front nor from behind, it is a revelation (tanzeel) [sent down] from the all-Wise, all-Praiseworthy</b>" [41:42], as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said: "<b>Say: If [the whole of ] mankind and the jinn gathered together to bring a like of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they would not be able to bring a like of it, even if they were helpers to one another</b>." (al-Israa 17:88)</blockquote>    <P>
This challenge has been made because the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> originated with Allaah, it is His Speech, and it is not possible for the Jinn and men to produce something like it. This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have, in letter and word, is Allaah's Speech, and it is uncreated and it cannot be rivaled or matched or equaled. The saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their offshoots (Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), is that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is either the creation of Jibreel, or of Muhammad (alayhis salaam), meaning that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have with us, in letter and word, actually originated with the creation. As for the unanimous saying of the Salaf, it is that "<i>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Allaah's Speech, it originated with Him (i.e. He spoke it) and to Him will it return</i>".     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if a man swore an oath that he will not speak today, then he recited the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or prayed, reciting the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (therein), or made salutation in the prayer, he would not have broken his oath. Nothing is to be analogised with the Speech of Allaah. </blockquote>    <P>
This means that since a person is only speaking the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then he has not broken his oath, since that speech is not his, it is Allaah's speech, meaning the words that he is uttering, they are not his words and did not originate with him, they belong to Allaah in reality.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, it began with Him (i.e. He spoke it), and to Him will it return.</blockquote>    <P>
This is a saying reported from hundreds amongst the Salaf and it deserves a separate article.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Nothing from Allaah is created, nor His Attributes, nor His Names, nor His Knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
This is why the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah is kufr. As they claim that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have present with us is created, then it means that Allaah's speech is created and that His knowledge is created, because the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, as well as being from Allaah's knowledge - in the sense that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> contains what is from Allaah's knowledge, as well as Allaah knowing from eternity, that He will speak the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> - it is also His speech. This would mean that that Allaah's attributes are created.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Note</font>    <P>
This is a great statement from one of the Imaams of the Salaf and there are many others which expose the intellectual fraud of the later and contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> - for they are very adept at concealing the reality of their saying on this issue as they know that its falsehood is readily apparent and that they are in reality in agreement with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - by admission in their own books.    <P>
