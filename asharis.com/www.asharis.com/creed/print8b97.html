<img src=assets/images/saeed-foudah.gif align=right width="120" style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;border-radius:6px;" border="1" border=0> The contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as "Ash'aris" have raised an issue regarding the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1575; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), in particular the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) which occurs in some manuscripts as (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) and which is in agreement with narrations from the Salaf who preceded Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. In this series we want to address the claims of one considered to be from the kibaar (senior) amongst the  <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> (pictured). Historically, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have always been considered corrupt in intellect and our case sample (Foudah) in these articles will be a confirmation of this trend. The reader will find truly laughable the attempt of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> to distort the statement and intent of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (in its historical context) who clarified the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah with respect to the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.     <P>
<b>The key lesson to take away from this series is that <u>history</u> is one of the routes through which the lies and fabrications of the deviants and innovators are exposed. It is known that the Sahaabah, the Taabi'een, the Muhadditheen and the Scholars of Ahl al-Hadeeth have utilized history and the historical record to falsify matters which on the surface appeared to be authentic and coherent, whether that be in relation to claims of history or chains of narration.</b>    <P>
One should also note that people like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and their ancestors are the students of the <b>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</b> and they are not the students of the <i>Sahaabah</i>, <i>Taabi'een</i> and <i>Taabi' Taabi'een</i>. The isnaad (chain) of their theological speech goes back through  the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to those same Hellenized Jews, Christians  and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and eventually to <b>Aristotle bin Nicomachus</b> (d. 322BC) whose speech about the "<i>first cause</i>" is the actual foundation of speech regarding the deity of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. <b>At least al-Qaradawi is very frank and open about it</b>. See the little incident in the kitchen between al-Qaradawi and G.F. Haddaad, (<a href=index09b7.html?snaca>domestic problems</a> in the house of kalaam) to learn more.  </blockquote> </div> <P>




<p><blockquote>In <a href=indexa2c8.html?ctuiuhq>Part 1</a> of this series we summarized six points that are to be found in Saeed Foudah's commentary on al-Tahawi's statements regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and we gave a brief historical account as to <b>why</b>, <b>when</b> and <b>how</b> the doctrine of two Qur'ans came to be, one that is uncreated (in <i>ma'naa</i>) and the other created (in <i>lafdh</i>). This goes back to the debates between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> where <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> innovated a new third saying (in addition to that of the Salaf and that of the Mu'tazilah). The two foundations for this new third saying lie firstly in the opinion of star and idol worshippers of Greece (the "<i>first cause</i>" does not act through will and choice) and secondly the alleged opinion of a cross-worshipping Trinitarian Christian (speech is just meaning in the self). As for the revealed Books and sent Messengers, they came with affirmation of Allaah speaking and acting through his will and choice, this being from utmost perfection and not, as per the view of the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> [Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah] operating on the conceptual baggage of those star and idol worshippers, that this necessitates he is a body (<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>) and is therefore kufr. The entirety of the Salaf of the first three generations (or centuries) are against those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (and their later offshoots) in this regard.     <P>
In this article we want to document the saying of the Salaf that  (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</span>), "<i>the Qur'aan is the speech of Allaah, it commenced with Him and to Him shall it return</i>" and explain the meaning of this statement as intended by the Salaf in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, which is that Allaah is the one who first <u>spoke</u> the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> coming from Allaah as actual speech (that is heard), since this was the thing being denied by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in that era.     <P>

Diy&#257; al-D&#299;n al-Maqdis&#299; (d. 643H) writes in his excellent short treatise: <i>Ikhtis&#257;s al-Qur&#702;&#257;n Bi &#703;Awdih&#299; il&#257; al-Rah&#299;m al-Rahm&#257;n</i> (Maktabah al-Rushd, 1989), pp. 21-22:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This has been said by Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitiy, he is the Shaykh of al-Bukh&#257;r&#299;, Muslim, Ab&#363; D&#257;wud, Ibn M&#257;jah and al-Nas&#257;'&#299;. And this wording (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</span>) has been related from a group, amongst them Abdullah bin Mas'&#363;d, Sufyan al-Thawr&#299;, Wak&#299; bin al-Jarr&#257;h, Abu Nu'aym al-Fadl bin Dukayn, Abdull&#257;h bin al-Mub&#257;rak...</blockquote>    <P>
Then he brings a narration from Imaam Ahmad:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And al-Marr&#363;dh&#299; Ahmad bin Muhammad reported, saying: Im&#257;m Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal said (rahimahull&#257;h): I met the men, the scholars, the jurists, in Makkah, Mad&#299;nah, K&#363;fah, Basrah, Sh&#257;m, Khuras&#257;n, al-Thugh&#363;r, and I saw them upon the Sunnah and Jam&#257;&#703;ah, and I asked the Fuqah&#257; about it, and all of them were saying, "The Qur&#702;&#257;n is the speech (kal&#257;m) of All&#257;h, uncreated, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</span>) from Him did it  commence and to Him shall it return.</blockquote>    <P>
As for Sufyan al-Thawree (d. 161H), then al-Laalikaa'ee relates it in <i>Sharh Usool I'tiqaad Ahl al-Sunnah</i> (1/151) with a saheeh chain to Sufyaan:    <P>
<blockquote><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'> &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583; &#1605;&#1606; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1601;&#1607;&#1608; &#1603;&#1601;&#1585;</div></blockquote>    <P>

This statement is also related from <b>Sufyan bin Uyainah</b> (d. 198H) and <b>Abu Bakr bin Ayyaash</b> (d. 193H) by <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> in his book <i><a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a></i> both through Abu Hatim al-Razee.

However, greater than all of what has preceded is the narration of <b>Amr bin D&#299;n&#257;r al-Makk&#299;</b> (d. 126H), from the trustworthy ones (thiq&#257;t) amongst the T&#257;bi&#703;&#299;n, who had met the Companions of All&#257;h's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). He said as is related by Diy&#257; al-D&#299;n al-Maqdis&#299; in the aforementioned book (pp. 28-29):    <P>
<blockquote><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1583;&#1585;&#1603;&#1578; &#1605;&#1588;&#1575;&#1610;&#1582;&#1606;&#1575;  &#1605;&#1606;&#1584; &#1587;&#1576;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606;: &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</div></blockquote>    <P>

And al-Maqdisi also relates through Sufyan bin Uyainah from him (Amr bin D&#299;n&#257;r):     <P>
<blockquote><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1583;&#1585;&#1603;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587; &#1605;&#1606;&#1584; &#1587;&#1576;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1603;&#1604;&#1607;&#1605; &#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1580;&#1604; &#1575;&#1587;&#1605;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602; &#1608;&#1605;&#1575; &#1587;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607; &#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1601;&#1573;&#1606;&#1607; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1582;&#1585;&#1580; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</div></blockquote>    <P>

And this is also related by <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> in <i>al-Asmaa wal-Sifaat</i> (1/598) (<a href=assets/images/amr-bin-deenar-quran-kalam.jpg>see page here</a>), wherein <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> adds, citing from Ishaaq bin Raahuyah:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>My father said: Amr Bin Dinar met the loftiest of the Companions of Allaah's Messenger from the people of Badr, the Muhajiree and the Ansar, such as Jabir bin Abdullaah, Abu Sa'eed al-Khudree, Abdullaah bin Amr, Abdullaah bin Abbaas, Abdullaah bin Zubayr (radiallaahu anhum) and the loftiest of Taabi'een (may Allaah have  mercy upon them) and upon this have the heart of this ummah proceeded, they did not differ about that.</blockquote>    <P>
And there is also the statement of <b>Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee</b> alluded to earlier by Diy&#257; al-D&#299;n al-Maqdis&#299;. He relates it with a <i>saheeh</i> chain on p. 31 of his book (<a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>see documentation here</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever claims that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things, or that the Qur'aan is a hikaayah (quotation), then he is, by Allaah, besides whom there is none worthy of worship, a zindeeq (heretic), kaafir (disbeliever) in Allaah.  This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the [very] <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah revealed upon the tongue of Jibreel, upon Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).

Note that this speech is a powerful refutation of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and you would do well to read the full article "<b>Ahmad bin Sinan al-Waasitee (d. 258H): Shaykh of <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> and Muslim Sends <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> Fleeing From Their Secret Hideouts: 'Whoever Says the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Two Things Or a Hikaayah is, by Allaah, a Zindeeq, Kaafir</b>" (<a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>see here</a>) for all of it can be used as a refutation of the deception that <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> has attempted to bring over the statement of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>.    <P>

We see that the Salaf preceded Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> in these statements and <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>, in his creed, wherein he states (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>) is in fact citing what the Salaf had said in response to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu't'azilah and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> in the second and third centuries hijrah. That which is related from the Salaf is the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>), and <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is simply intending what they intended. As for the meaning, then it is clear:     <P>
It is intended to answer the question of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, what is it and where did it come from? The <b><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></b> said it is a created thing. The <b><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></b> likewise, said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a created thing because Allah does not have any attributes (according to both factions). Rather, His attributes (to the Mu'tazilah) are created entities which can be ascribed to Him. Allaah's "power" means the power of the wind, the ocean, and other manifestations of power in the creation, not an actual attribute ascribed to His essence, but created manifestations of power that can be said to belong to Him, just like it is said, "<i>Allaah's House</i>" and "<i>Allaah's Messenger</i>." In a similar way, they said Allaah's speech is that which He creates in others. Then there came <b>Ibn Kullaab and the Kullaabiyyah</b> after the tribulation of the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in the early third century, and they agreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that this Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created (due to falling prey to their doubts regarding Allaah's will and choice) and alongside this they were hard pressed to affirm the attribute of speech, so they innovated the <i>kalam nafsee</i> doctrine for this end. The outcome is exactly the same, that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, the same <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> intended (since all Muslims without exception never knew except one Qur'an), but now they had a new, unheard of attribute to make it appear as if they had affirmed the attribute of speech, when it was no such thing in reality. Hence, they (like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah)  were forced to deny that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was spoken by Allah with actual speech. However, they had to explain where this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> came from as we have it in the Arabic language. So some of them said Jibreel was inspired with the meaning and He expressed it and others said the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) expressed it. And a third saying is that Allaah created it in the <i>Lawh al-Mahfudh</i>. This third opinion is a preferred saying because it allows the deception to be made by the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in their saying, "<i>Both the meaning and the wording is from Allaah without any created being intervening to express the wording</i>" without them revealing that by <i>wording</i> they mean "<i>created wording</i>" since Allaah, according to them, created it in the Preserved Tablet from where Jibreel took it subsequently.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>For confirmation from the Ash'aris that they are in agreement with the Muta'zilah that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created see <a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>here</a> and <a href=indexf452.html?bxzbp >here</a> (<b> al-Bayjuri</b>), <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >here</a> (<b><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></b>), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> (<b><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></b>) and <a href=index2714.html?kiagk >here</a> (<b> al-Buti</b>). All of these are frank and honest unlike <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a>.  Don't forget to read the following too:  <b>Ibn Qudaamah</b> on the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heretics holding the two <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> doctrine (in secrecy and fear): (<a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>see here</a>) - this explains the activities of people like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a>. <b>Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee</b> (d. 258H), Shaykh of <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> and Muslim  (<a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>see here</a>). And <b><a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a></b> (d. 310H) could not have said it better and clearer <a href=index171b.html?xyfnr>see here</a>. And watch <b><a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a></b> (d. 387H) lift the lid (<a href=index681f.html?xbxok>see here</a>). May Allaah reward these Imaams of the Salaf for clarifying the truth and in their speech is an exposition of the deceiver <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a>.</div>    <P>
To all of these factions (in their respective times) the Salaf said (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</span>), and the intent here was to say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was spoken by Allaah (through His will and choice) with actual speech that was heard by Jibreel (alayhis salaam). That it was not created "<i>laa fee mahall</i>" (in no place) as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say, and nor that it commenced as the speech of Jibreel or Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) being an expression (ibaarah) or quotation (hikaayah) of the meaning (ma'naa) present with Allaah and nor that it was taken by Jibreel only and directly from the Preserved Tablet into which Allaah had placed the wording. The Salaf intended that Allah actually spoke it and it commenced with Him as speech (<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>, <i>qawl</i>) and revelation (<i>wahy</i>), and in whichever way it is conveyed - whilst the medium of conveyance is created (reciter's <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, written mus-haf with ink, paper) - the words conveyed are uncreated because they commenced as Allaah's uncreated speech with a true and real speech that was heard and which is unlike any speech of the creation. And this is the very doctrine espoused by <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> in his creed which <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> attempts to distort and twist in a despicable type of way as we shall see inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Why Are These Feeble-Minded <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Confused?</font>    <P>
The answer to this question comes back down to what was mentioned in <a href=indexa2c8.html?ctuiuhq>Part 1</a>: They followed the star and idol-worshipping <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of 4th century BC Greece in denying Allaah's will (mashee'ah) and choice (ikhtiyaar) in blatant opposition to every revealed Book, every sent Messenger and every companionship of every sent Prophet and in opposition to the language of the Arabs. As a direct result of this, they wrongly thought that when Ahl al-Sunnah say, "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> commenced with Allaah as speech</i>" this can only  mean that Allaah acquired the attribute of speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) after not having it, and hence the addition of a new attribute means He was imperfect prior to it. They can only arrive at this conclusion because they deny Allaah speaks and acts through will, choice.  Now the claim of Allah acquiring attributes He never had before in principle is not the saying nor the <i>laazim</i> (binding necessity) of the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah, but it is the saying of another <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> faction, called the <b><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></b>. They held this view because they were also holding onto that false corrupt argument of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (kalam cosmological argument). They simply proposed a different way of validating its major underlying premise (<i>impossiblity of an endless chain of events in the past</i>). So they said, Allaah acquired attributes (those requiring an exercising of will and choice) after not having them but they remained permanent thereafter, and through this they claimed to have avoided an endless chain of events in the past (as in Allaah being one who eternally speaks and acts according to His will), and they also denied they were affirming hawaadith (events) in Allaah's essence, because they said an event is what occurs and expires, whereas these attributes Allaah acquired <u>do not</u> subsequently expire and end, hence they cannot be understood to be <i>hawaadith</i>. This was their method of validating the argument and remaining true to all its premises. So all of these groups from the Kalam dynasty, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Karraaamiyyah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, <a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a>, they are all united upon the foundations of this corrupt theology, but they were led to different sayings based on the way they attempted to validate the underlying premises.     <P>
It is here that <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> such as <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> demonstrate either their ignorance and confusion or their wilful deception. For Ahl al-Sunnah affirm, upon the Book, the Sunnah and consensus that Allaah speaks and acts through will and choice and that His attributes such as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech), qudrah (power) and so on <b>are eternal from an aspect</b>, they are also tied to Allaah's will and power from another and hence, Allaah speaks and acts as and when He wills, and whenever Allaah exercises His will in relation to those attributes, it in no way means that those attributes are created or came to be after not being. <b>Rather, Allaah is eternally one who speaks and acts as and when He wills</b>. This is the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah, exemplified in Imaam Ahmad's refutation of the bid'ah of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, wherein he said, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1586;&#1604; &#1605;&#1578;&#1603;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575; &#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1588;&#1575;&#1569;</span>). When the  <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and all their offshoots in the Kalam dynasty rejected this matter of Allaah's will and choice, then they departed from both reason and revelation, and this is why it is binding that the <i>aql</i> of anyone who builds this theology upon kalam is automatically compromised, and hence we will start seeing foolishness, contradiction, inconsistency emanating from his speech. This is what we shall observe and witness in the next part to this series, when we analyze the full passage of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> and Saeed Foudahs' distortion of it.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
In this article, we documented the fact that the statement (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>), "<i>From Him it commenced...</i>" and in particular the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) has been narrated from the Salaf and that <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> took this wording and meaning from the Salaf, and the intent is to refute the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> all of whom claim Allaah never spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with actual speech (and thereby the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not His <i>actual</i> speech). Due to a variation in the wording in the manuscripts of al-Tahawi's creed where some manuscripts use the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>), <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and his likes have attempted to distort both history and the intent of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> within the context of that history. In the next article we will analyze and make comparison between the doctrine of the Salaf and Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> on the one hand, and on the other, that of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and his <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> ancestry.    <P>
