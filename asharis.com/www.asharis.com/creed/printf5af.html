<p>All praise is due to Allaah and may the prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/top-tips.gif align=left border=0> We are pleased to announce a new and much needed section entitled "<b>Top Tips To Become a Better Ash'ari</b>". Unfortunately, we are <u>not very impressed or pleased</u> with the level of ignorance found amongst the vast majority of Ash'aris. The vast majority of Ash'aris don't really understand the foundations of their creed, and their superiors keep it deliberately hidden from them. You will agree no doubt, this needs to be remedied. For this reason, "<b><a href='tags/top-tips.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>top tips</font></a></b>" will provide the background knowledge and understanding to give those Ash'aris who are lagging behind a bit of sense, purpose, direction and impetus, after they understand exactly what their creed is founded upon.     <P>
This series should be followed along with our  "<u><a href='tags/competition-corner.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Competition Corner</font></a></u>" series (<a href=series/ashari-competition-and-quiz-corner---test-your-ashariyyah.html>see here</a>), as they are in fact both complementary to each other. No matter what your level, a beginner, or a promising Kalam Atomist, these tips will still help you. You should also remember, there are lots of those 'evil wahhabis' on the one hand and 'crazy atheist philosophers' on the other that need to be kept at bay. There's no point looking brave and serious <u>when your pockets are empty</u>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> These tips are to help readers get inside the actual "core" thinking of the Ash'arite creed, in other words to grasp the reasoning and logic upon which the Ash'arite creed is based upon. </div>    <P>
So here goes, this is our opening tip - and our tips by the way are in no particular order, they are random and miscellaneous:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The 1st Tip: The Reason Why <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is Made</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/top-tips-1.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Tip Tafseer</font>    <P>
<b><u>Point 1:</u> What is "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</b>    <P>
If you have never heard of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" before now, then it is outright disgraceful that as an Ash'ari you are ignorant of the most important foundation of your entire creed. You need to be clued up on bodies and substances (ajsaam, jawaahir) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and what they are. Aristotle's the best man for this, and  his "<i>Ten Categories</i>" lay a lot of the foundations. We may cover that in a separate tip.    <P>
"<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" means the createdness of bodies (i.e. whatever is in the universe), and this is demonstrated by the presence of qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith) that are found in bodies, and which bodies are not free of. Because these things are found in bodies (ajsaam) it must mean - according to this proof - that they are created (this is a simplification at this point, you can look at the details in other articles on this site). It is upon this underlying classification (of matter) and subsequent reasoning to prove a Creator, that the entire Ash'arite creed is built upon, however the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> did not pioneer this, they simply inherited it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>Point 2:</u> Thanks Jahm For this Intellectual Proof and For Inventing <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> For Us, We are Indebted to You</b>    <P>
First, give credit where credit is due. You should recall that <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (d. 128H) was the first to use this form of proof against those 'nasty, evil' Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> called the "<a href="tags/sumaniyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sumaniyyah</font></a>". He managed to convince them that attributes in bodies prove they are newly-arisen, created, and as the whole universe is made of bodies (ajsaam), then the universe is created and therefore  must have a creator. So these Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> accepted there was a creator but then asked Jahm to describe this creator. It was here that the necessity for (<a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>) and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> was born. The light bulb switched on in Jahms head and he realized that the best way to answer these 'nasty, evil' <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>  - who were simply trying to play smart with this question  - and the best way to put them squarely in their place was just to make <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation) and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (metaphorical interpretation) of all attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) established for Allaah in the revealed texts. This would immediately silence those nasties from criticizing and falsifying the proof and give them no refuge from admitting a creator. This action of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> was the basis for the rejection of <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> and Attributes that was inherited by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>.    <P>
This matter <a href=series/atomism-and-hudooth-ul-ajsaam-the-core-foundation-of--the-jahmite-ashari-religion.html>has already been covered extensively</a> on this site and you should definitely do a little homework reading on that first.    <P>
<b><u>Point 3:</u> Thanks <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> in Particular, For Doing Most of the Groundwork</b>    <P>
Again, as a good and honest Ash'ari, you must give credit where credit is due. <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (d. 235H) was the one who really formalized Jahm's crude version of this proof called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", and to refine it and make it better he incorporated a theory preceded by that of the "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" of the Greek Philosopher, <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (d. 370BC). With the introduction of the "indivisible particle" by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, it was easier to argue for the similarity of bodies (tamaathul al-ajsaam) and therefore, to show that the entire universe (made of such bodies) is created. You can do bit of homework on al-Allaaf <a href=indexf76c.html?ippev>from this article here</a>. All of the ta'weels that you are involved in (as an Ash'ari) have their origins with these people, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the likes of Bishr al-Mareesee. Again, you won't find your current day teachers telling you that..., instead they will try to hoodwink you into believing that these ta'weels originated with the Salaf, which is a blatant lie, that can be demonstrated with clinical precision in other articles.    <P>
<b><u>Point 4:</u> Thanks <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a>, Bishr al-Mareesee, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> for all your Ta'weels</b>    <P>
Again, give credit where credit is due - be honest and scrupulous at all times. All the major ta'weels of the texts were thought of by these characters and factions.     <P>
<b><u>Point 5:</u> Why Is <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> Being Made</b>    <P>
Now, we are coming to explain the core of this tip, so please pay attention, and this really is the crux of it all, this explains the entire thrust of the Ash'arite creed.    <P>
So, "we" (speaking through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah) have argued against those 'crazy' atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that  something having incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith) taking place <u>is proof</u> that it is newly-arisen, created. By doing this we were able to prove to those crazies the notions of <u>creation</u>, and therefore a <u>creator</u>, and thus <u>prophethood</u> and <u>resurrection</u>. However, when they turned round and said to us, "Describe  your creator", then obviously we could not describe Him with what is found in  much of the revealed texts as that would falsify our proof against those crazies, because in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> there are "names" and "attributes" and "actions" affirmed for Allaah. So we are going to shut those crazies up, just like Jahm did with one broad sweep, so we are just going to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of what we feel would hint at the falsification of our proof from the revealed texts. And that's essentially what <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is, it is "an approach" which aims to "deal" with those "problematic" texts that go against this "decisive proof".    <P>
Except that "we" (Ash'aris) had a bust up with Jahm and his friends, and al-Allaaf and his friends (the Mu'tazilah) - <b>we had an argument with them as to what exactly does and does not conflict with the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" from the texts</b>. And we also had a bust up with al-Allaaf and his friends over some of the finer details of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". But let's not go into that right now.    <P>
So what we are doing is that whenever we come across any revealed text that directly or indirectly invalidates our intellectual proof, we have to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of it. So anything in those revealed texts that implies that Allah is described with some quality or action temporally, instead of eternally - or anything that implies any of the nine incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) of bodies (ajsaam, jawaahir) that <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> classified, amongst which were location and place, (<a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>thanks greekos</a> - always give credit where credit is due) then <u>we must</u> make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of it.    <P>
So in a nutshell that's what we are up to, and that is where we are coming from. We are trying to make our belief in the creator, and our description of Him to remain as close as possible to Aristotle's "Ten Categories", we have to negate these categories from Allaah, and thus our language is all based around negating these "ten categories" from Allaah.     <P>
<b><u>Point 6:</u> <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is our Defense Mechanism</b>    <P>
From the previous point it should become clear now that <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is <u>a defense mechanism</u> which protects that <u>intellectual rational proof</u> of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" of our good friends <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) and followers, and Abu al-Huhdayl al-Allaaf (d. 235) and followers and likewise the Ash'aris and their followers. You see Jahm and followers and al-Allaaf and followers were clued up on how to defend their turf, and that's why <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> was pioneered by them. So as a good, honest Ash'ari, you ought to be grateful to those people, because that is whom you inherited your creed from in reality.    <P>
<b><u>Point 7:</u> <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the Texts Has its Weaknesses</b>    <P>
Having said all that, whilst <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> was adopted as a defence mechanism for protecting the fortress of "<i><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></i>", it does have some weaknesses and flaws, as it amounts to lying upon Allaah, for one has no idea as to whether the claimed <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is intended by Allaah or not. And it is here where we find the splits between the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> themselves and between the Maturidis and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>
    <P>
