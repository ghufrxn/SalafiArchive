<div class="articleContent">






<p>In a previous article we quoted from one of the earliest and perhaps second most important figure in the formalization of the Ash'ari Madhhab, Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, on the subject of where is Allaah, from his book "at-Tamheed".    <P>
This has disturbed the Ash'ari <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and they have started, as usual, to try and patch up the psychological comfort they need to maintain their belief in a madhhab as contradictory and confusing as the Ash'ari madhhab which is a in reality a mixture of:     <P>
<ul><li>The usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (the bulk of their positions are based on the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by which they have been influenced - many of their differences with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are on subsdidiary issues)  <li>Ilm ul-Kalaam  <li>The sayings of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> who preceded <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (amongst which is affirming the seven attributes)  <li>And the adoption of much of the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who preceded them, and their Imaam (chief and leader) in all of that being Bishr al-Mareesee.</ul>    <P>
And inshaa'Allaah this will be amply demonstrated on this site.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Statement of al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font>    <P>
Let's revisit al-Baqillani's statement again:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baqillani-sifaat-tamheed-text-uluww.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter</b>: And if someone says: Where is He? It is said to him: Asking where (al-ayn) is asking about place (al-makaan) and He is not one that a place (makaan) is permitted to enclose (yahwee), and nor [one that] places can encompass. Except that we say: Indeed He is Above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, [but] not with the meaning of a body [being as such] through contact and adjacency, Exalted is He above that with a Lofty Exaltation.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
  <b><u>First:</u></b> al-Baqillani raises the issue of someone asking "Where" regarding Allaah. He kind of disapproves of the raising of this question through his next couple of sentences. Since all creation is either <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) or <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Mu'tazilite and Ash'arite theologians) - and since space or location are unessential attributes of substances (bodies), then designating space or location, necessitates, according to them, enclosure by space, and thus being a body like the created bodies.     <P>
And our approach, the sound Sunni approach is to halt at all words not used in the Book or the Sunnah. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in Dar' ut-Ta'aarud (1/133):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And when these words are general, then the one addressing them (i.e. addressing those using them) should either clarify and say [to them], "What do you mean by these words". If they explain them with the meaning that agrees with the Qur'aan, they are accepted. If they explain them in opposition to that, they are rejected. And either he withholds from agreeing with them in speaking with these words, in negation or affirmation. And if he withholds himself in speaking with these words with them, they will accuse him of incapacity and severance (i.e. withdrawing). And if he speaks with these terms with them they will accuse him of applying those words that contain both truth and falsehood, and they will then make the ignorant ones to think that the application of those words encompasses false meanings from which Allaah is to be declared free of".</blockquote>    <P>
So we say: If it is meant by al-makaan (place) that Allaah is contained by space such as is observed in the creation, where all things are contained in space by virtue of their being within the creation, then this meaning is false. And if it is meant by al-makaan, Allaah's existence outside of the creation (where the notion of "enclosure by space" is impossible for Allaah), then we affirm this meaning and simply say, "Allaah is above the Throne".    <P>
<b><u>Second:</u></b> There is no one from those who affirm that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the Creation - following the Salaf in that -  who holds that Allaah is enclosed by space and is therefore a body. These are only things made binding in the minds of the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. So they make analogies for Allaah with the creation. They think that since in this creation substances (body) only exist surrounded by space, and as such they can be said to have direction or location by virtue of that, then as Allaah is not like His creation, we have to negate from Him having direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>) and location (makaan).     <P>
And if anyone says "Allaah is above the Throne", they (the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'aris) resemble Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to what they see and observe in the creation (of substances and bodies having attributes including space and direction), and so they say "you have attributed direction and location to Allaah and have likened him to the created bodies". So the sickness <u>is really  in their mind</u>, but they want to project that sickness onto others.    <P>
If you (i.e. <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari) say,     <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Although no one verbally says this (i.e. that Allaah is enclosed by space and therefore a body), this is nevertheless, the implication of your belief that Allaah is, in reality, above the Throne</blockquote>    <P>
<u>Then you have just judged the Qur'aan and the Sunnah, and hundreds of statements, if not thousands, from the Companions and their Successors, and the Salaf in general, to be speaking with what is in your view apparent kufr and shirk</u>.    <P>
And on top of this, this is without there being even a single indication in all of those verses, ahaadeeth and statements, that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in a true and real sense, but only in a metaphorical sense. Rather, we find the Imaams of the Sunnah, before al-Baqillani and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> were born, condemning those who denied Allaah was above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (with His Essence), such as the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who said He is in every place (with His Essence). And their statements in this regard are numerous. <a href=index6afa.html?darjp>See this article for details</a>.    <P>
So speaking with what the Book and the Sunnah spoke with does not necessitate the false implications that are imposed by the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> and their followers who speak with the poison of the Greek and Hindu <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology.    <P>
The pagan <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (such as the Greeks and Hindus) who came before, attempted to classify and categorize reality according to their logic, intellect, observation and reflection and so they said that all existence is either <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) or <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) and that accidents cannot exist in and of themselves but need substances (jawaahir). The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> simply took this philosophy, refined it a little and then used it to prove Allaah's existence by demonstrating the created, temporal nature of the universe.     <P>
<b>But then when that became a fundamental element of their expression and explanation of their creed  (it became standard in all their books), they were influenced by it in other affairs, such as Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, Allaah's Attributes that are tied to His Will, al-Qadr and so on.</b>    <P>
<b><u>Third:</u></b> However, al-Baqillani was shrewd and was more sound and coherent than the later ones, and the truth and obviousness of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in truth and in reality is so powerful that al-Baqillani had do say: "<u>Except that we say:</u> Indeed He is Above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>...". And in his words "ghayr annaa naqoolu", "<u>Except that we say:</u> ..." indicates this.     <P>
Then he says straight after this:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[...but] not with the meaning of a body [being as such] through contact and adjacency, Exalted is He above that with a Lofty Exaltation</i> </blockquote>    <P>
In other words we affirm that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - as that cannot be denied - however not with the meaning of a body [being as such] through contact and adjacency. In other words he affirms Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> whilst negating an incorrect meaning. And if an affirmation is made along with the denial of an incorrect meaning, it shows that there is a correct meaning: that He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <b><u>without</u></b> being enclosed by space and nor being a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - since that is only characteristic of created bodies - and that does not apply to Allaah, the Creator. And if this meaning was impossible al-Baqillani would not have said, "<u>Except that we say:</u> Indeed He is Above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>...".    <P>
<b><u>Fourth:</u></b> Some of the confused <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> have tried to claim that al-Baqillani is denying that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, despite him clearly and explicitly stating as such. So they have said that al-Baqillani is denying makaan and <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> (place and direction) and is denying Allaah being a body and showing disapproval of the question "Where".     <P>
However, they can't explain al-Baqillani saying: "<b>Except that we say: Indeed He is Above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>...</b>". This has really disturbed them, and they have no real answer to this. And adh-Dhahabi confirms in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, that al-Baqillani affirms Allaah's aboveness (<a href=indexeb29.html?ltofu>see this article</a>) and the quote below. And likewise <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (considered an Ash'ari) also confirms that al-Baqillani holds Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence (bi dhaatihi) - <a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>see this article</a>.    <P>
<b><u>Fifth:</u></b> al-Baqillani said in his book "al-Ibaanah" as quoted from him by <a href='tags/imaam-adh-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam adh-Dhahabi</font></a> in his Mukhtasar al-Uluww:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baqillani-dhahabi-uluww-3.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Then if it is said: "Do you say that He is in every place?"     <P>
It is said (in reply): "Refuge is with Allaah, rather He is ascended (mustawinn) above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, just as He informed [us] in His Book, saying, "<b>Ar-Rahmaan has ascended above the Throne</b>", and He said, "<b>The good word (al-kalim ut-tayyib) ascends up to Him</b>", and He said, "<b>Do you feel secure that He who is above the heaven</b> ..." ... [he, al-Baqillani said]: And if He was in every place, then He would have been in a man's stomach, his mouth, and in the  [public] toilets, and it would be necessitated that He increases with the increase of spaces (places) when He creates of them those that did not previously exist, and it would be correct that [people turn to Him], seeking Him towards the earth, and to behind of us, and to our right and our left. And the Muslims are agreed upon what opposes this and [agreed] upon declaring the one who says this to be erroneous..."</blockquote>     <P>
<b><u>Finally:</u></b> Refer back to the speech of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> quoted earlier and you will see the methodology of these people. When you say, "Allaah is above His Throne", and you use the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the sayings of the Companions, and the great Imaams of the Salaf, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> respond with: "You've affirmed makaan (place) and <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> (direction) and <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) for Allaah". Now, where have they taken this from?     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>How can it be that when you speak with the manifest, clear speech of Allaah, these people respond to you with statements that are made on the basis of underlying concepts that have been derived from the Greek and Hindu <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>? And they make binding that speaking with the apparent, manifest verses of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is tantamount to kufr and shirk.</b></div>    <P>
The reason why they do this goes back to their adoption of philosophical and rational principles that are a crucial and fundamental aspect of their creed, and unfortunately, it does not remain just as a means to prove Allaah's existence, it actually affects a wider range of their views in the affairs of creed, as will be demonstrated inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
However, these statements of al-Baqillani pose a particular problem for the later <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> in that he affirms Allah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, above the Heaven, whilst negating from Him enclosure by space and being a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - and this is besides al-Baqillani's affirmation of the attributes of Face, Hands, and Eyes for Allaah, which today's <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> would consider <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (<a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>see this article</a>). In fact, al-Baqillani went further and refuted the very ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that today's <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Ash'aris have adopted!  </ul>       <P>
   <P>
