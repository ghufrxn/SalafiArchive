<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>After the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> / <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were subdued and humiliated in their claim that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and not the Speech of Allaah, they split into three groups: <b>a)</b> those who remained saying the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created <b>b)</b> those who withheld from expressing their view (al-Waaqifah) and <b>c)</b> those who began to say "My recitation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created" intending by that to reach their original saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, and they are the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
These people appeared openly in the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and this approach was carried by the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, Husayn al-Karaabeesee and al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee, and they formed the ideological precursor for the later <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> heresy that there are two Qur'ans (<a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>see here</a>). Rejection of this saying (al-Lafdh) is famous from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others, however there are some narrations related from Imaam al-Shaafi'ee on this topic. Given that this statement did not appear till after the subduing of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, some observations exist on these narrations. The debate between al-Shafi'ee and Hafs al-Fard was on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> whether it was created or not and not on the issue of al-Lafdh, and similarly, the objection against Bishr al-Mareesee was of the same type. In any case we present these narrations below for the record, whilst noting that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> declared Husayn al-Karaabeesee (a companion of Imaam al-Shaafi'ee) a "<a href="tags/jahmite.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmite</font></a>" and that he had "<i>adopted the view of al-Jahm</i>" as related by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi in his Taareekh and other authorities. Thus, irrespective of whether rejection of the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> is related authentically from al-Shafi'ee or not, it remains as a matter of historical fact that the saying of al-Lafdh is the ideological precursor for the saying of the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created.</blockquote> </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What is Related From <a href='tags/imaam-ash-shaafiee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee</font></a> Regarding the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> </font>    <P>
Al-Laalikaa'ee (d. 418H) narrates (2/390-391, no. 599) with his isnaad:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shaafiee-quran-lafdh.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Al-Husain bin Ahmad bin Ibraaheem at-Tabaree said: I heard Ahmad bin Yoosuf ash-Shaalanjee saying: I heard Abu Abdullaah al-Husain bin Alee al-Qattaan saying: I heard Alee bin al-Husain bin al-Junaid saying: I heard ar-Rabee' saying: I heard ash-Shaafi'ee saying:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Whoever said my pronunciation with the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with my pronunciation is created, then he is a Jahmee.</b></blockquote>    <P>
And this wording has also been narrated from Abu Zur'ah [ar-Raazee] and Alee bin Khashrum.</blockquote>    <P>
And Alee bin Ahmad bin Yoosuf al-Hakkaaree (d. 486H) brings the same statement in his book "I'tiqaad ash-Shaafi'ee" (tahqeeq al-Burraak, p. 23):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shaafiee-quran-lafdh-hakkaaree.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Abu Nasr Ahmad bin al-Khidr al-Faariqee, and Abu al-Hasan Alee Ibn al-Husain al-Ukbaree, both informed us, saying: Abul-Qaasim Hibatullaah bin al-Hasan bin Mansoor al-Faqeeh ash-Shaafi'ee (rahimahullaah) informed us: Al-Husain bin Ahmad at-Tabaree informed us, he said: I heard Ahmad bin Yoosuf ash-Shaalanjee saying: I heard Alee bin al-Husain bin al-Junaid saying: I heard ar-Rabee' bin Sulaymaan saying: I heard ash-Shaafi'ee (radiallaahu anhu) saying:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Whoever said my pronunciation with the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, or the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with my pronunciation is created, then he is a Jahmee.</b></blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> Jahmiyyah: The Pronounced Recited <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created</font>    <P>
The doctrine of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> which the Salaf declared as "kufr"  is taught in all <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> institutions and centers across the world, through the likes of books such as al-Bayjuri's <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> upon Jawharat ut-Tawheed and in which there is explicit mention that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is al-lafdh al-maqroo' (the recited word) is created, and that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is superior to the recited word (al-lafdh al-maqroo') because he is the best of all creation (meaning the recited word is created), and repeating that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is recited is created on at least three occasions - <a href=indexf452.html?bxzbp>see this article here</a>, where we find the following three quotes from this standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> texbook (p. 161):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjuri-quran-better-or-prophet.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with the meaning of the wording that is recited more excellent? Or is our leader, Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [more excellent]. Some of them have held on to what has been reported [that]: "<i>Every letter is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad</i>". However it's [authenticity] is not verified as established. <b>And the truth is that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent because he is more excellent than every created thing (makhlooq)</b>, as is taken from the speech (i.e. commentary) of al-Jalaal al-Mahallee upon the Burdah. And what supports this is that it (the Qur'an) is the action of the reciter and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent than the reciter and all of his actions. But it is safer to withhold from the likes of this, for the mind being devoid of this does not harm it. End summarized quote from the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of the Shaykh, al-Ameer.</blockquote>    <P>
And al-Bayjuri says in another place (p. 162):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth-2.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the outcome (of this discussion) is that every apparent [text] from the Book and the Sunnah that indicates [its] <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> [meaning "created", to them the Mutakallimoon] then it is to be carried to [be in reference] to <u>the wording [lafdh] that is recited (al-lafdh al-maqroo')</u> and not the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsi</font></a> (meaning residing eternally with Allaah's Self]. However it is prohibited for it to be said, "The Qur'aan is created", <u>except in the situation of teaching</u>, as has been said.</blockquote>    <P>
And a couple of pages eary al-Bayjoori's said (p. 160), leaving no room for any doubt:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the madhhab of Ahl us-Sunnah is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, with the meaning of al-Kalaam an-Nafsi [the meaning that resides eternally with the Self of Allaah] is not created. <b>And as for the Qur'aan with the meaning of <u>the lafdh (the wording) that we recite</u>, then it is created</b>. However, it is prohibited that it be said, "The Qur'aan is created" intending by that the wording which we recite - <b>except in the context of teaching</b>. Because it may give the presumption that the Qur'aan, with the meaning of His The Most High's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (i.e. that which resides in the Self) is created. And for this reason, the scholars withheld from speaking with the Qur'aan [being] created.</blockquote>    <P>
In all of these quotes you can clearly see that to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <u>it is that which is maqroo' (what is recited) that is created</u>. And this is none other than the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> and you can learn about this species in our article:    <P>
<ul><li>The Six Stages In The Evolution Of the Doctrines of the 'Qur'an Creationists' - The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> - <a href=index30fa.html?fsffi>read article here</a>. </ul>    <P>
And you should also note that the book we have quoted from is one that makes tahqeeq (corroborating what is correct) of that which is in the madhhab - so it means that the book provides the actual, standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrines that they hold as their religion before Allaah, after resolving whatever differences have existed historically on the issue in their madhhab. In short, its the standard orthodox <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrine.    <P>
