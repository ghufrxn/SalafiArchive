<p>The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and all their offshoots (Mu'tazilah, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) need to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, because it invalidates their intellectual proof for demonstrating that the universe is created. They do this through what is called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - which is arguing that the qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and occurrences (hawaadith) found in bodies (ajsaam) are proof that they are created, and must have a creator. So when they saw in the Book and the Sunnah, Allaah described with what would amount to them to be <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) such as love, anger, pleasure, and being above the heaven and so on, they had to deny these attributes so as not to invalidate their rational proof. And thus they unleashed themselves against the revealed texts with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed in order to protect and save that (corrupt, flawed) intellectual proof from being falsified. The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, but negated <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (being a body) from Him - so they were different to the others in this view in that they held it was possible for Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without that invalidating their intellectual proof - so they added phrases like "without contact" and "without confinement" and so on.    <P>
The Salaf recognized the falsehood of the deniers and what they were leading towards. So from the things they had to reject was that the Qur'aan is the Speech of Allaah, and that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter, because Allaah speaking means He is subject to occurrences (hawaadith) and Allah being seen means he would be in a direction, and both of these would mean that Allaah is a body, and thus created - so they had to say the Qur'aan is created and Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter. And the greatest obstacle to their rational proof was Allaah being "above" the heaven - and so they had to deny this, but they could not do this openly, so they only hinted at it through the other issues, and the Salaf realized this from them through deduction.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Read more about this in detail here: <ul><li><b>The Four Doors in Explanation of Why the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Must Deny That Allaah is Above the Throne</b><BR>  <a href=index4bd8.html?pilwa>http://www.asharis.com/creed/?pilwa</a></ul></div>    <P>
Abul-Qasim Sulayman bin Ahmad at-Tabarani brings in "Kitaab us-Sunnah", as does adh-Dhahabi in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p.132-133) from al-Abbaas bin Fudayl al-Asfaatee from Sulayman bin Harb who said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/uluww-dhahabi-ayyub-sakhtiyani.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I heard Hammaad bin Zayd (b. 98H, d. 179H) (saying): I heard Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were mentioned, so he said: "The central axis of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven".</blockquote>    <P>
And adh-Dhahabi, in his "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" commented on this saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd).</blockquote>    <P>
And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in negating there is a Lord above the heaven, and we have documented elsewhere that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were also heavily involved in debating with the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> during the time of Haroon ar-Rasheed - <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>see here</a>. And they took up the form of argument of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (of <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> ul-ajsaam) but they refined it further, by adopting the "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" of some of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, so they adopted the notions of "<a href="tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>" (the individual particle" and "al-juz alladhee laa yatajazza'" (the indivisible particle) into their creed in order to refine and strengthen that same proof - and then the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> simply adopted that from <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> thereafter. And all of this was the "ilm ul-kalaam" that the Salaf condemned and rebuked.    <P>
But this saying of Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani was said before or around 131H which is when Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani died, and this is because the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> adopted the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and Allaah's <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, on account of that intellectual proof of <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>.    <P>
And reflect upon what Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani, that great and pious scholar, said about the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in his time, and Hammaad bin Zayd who narrated this from Ayyub, and he was no more than 30 years of age, he knew this for a whole fifty years, and he knew what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were intending.     <P>
And we see that Hammaad bin Zayd (d. 179H) used to say what he had heard from Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H) as is reported by Imaam ad-Dhahabee, in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.146):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/uluww-dhahabi-hammad-bin-zayd.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sulayman bin Harb said: I heard Hammad bin Zayd (d. 179H) saying: "They are circulating around [the issue of] of wanting to say that there is no deity above the heaven". He means the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
So the Salaf walillaahil-hamd were wise to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites, and all praise is due to Allaah who has preserved His deen through the speech of the pious Salaf.   <P>
