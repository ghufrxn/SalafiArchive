After making some general points on this at the end of <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>the first part of this article</a>, we can now comment on this piecemeal It is strongly recommended that you read <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>the first part</a> before proceeding with what is below.    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>These things that we mentioned are considered parts according to the people of the language...</blockquote>    <P>
What is correct is that in their <u>kaifiyyah</u>, these attributes for mankind, or the creation, are in the form of limbs as we know and see them, and as for Allaah, the Most High, then as He has textually stated, "<b>There is no likeness unto Him</b>... (42:11)", the kaifiyyah of His attributes is unlike that of the creation. Just like His hearing, seeing, will, power, speech are unlike those of the creation, and just as they are affirmed as attributes, then likewise for Face, Hands, Eyes and whatever else has come in the revealed texts and is ascribed to Allaah through the ruling of the language that it is indeed an attribute of Allaah. And this also shows that these people do not understand these attributes except in terms of what they see in the creation, and thus the <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, or its presumption originated with them, and then due to the repugnance they feel towards it, they reject it. Then they accuse anyone who speaks with the affirmation of these attributes without <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> of this very <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> which actually originated in their minds and hearts to begin with.    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and not adjectives (awsaf)...</blockquote>    <P>
This is baatil (false) and its refutation has already preceded from the likes of <a href='tags/at-tirmidhee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tirmidhee</font></a> (d. 279H), al-Baqillani (d. 403H), <a href='tags/al-khateeb-al-baghdaadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee</font></a> (d. 463H) and Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), each one of them spoke of Face (<a href='tags/al-wajh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-wajh</font></a>), Hands (al-yadaan), Eyes (al-aynaan) as from the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Dhaatiyyah - so this is a fraudulent statement - fear Allaah!    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So they [meaning these attributes] are explicit in indicating composition (tarkib), and composition is for bodies.</blockquote>    <P>
You need to pay real good attention here - this argument they have included here, in order to reject these as attributes of Allaah is in fact the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> against them for affirming the seven attributes. And these people do not have any scruples when it comes to fighting against the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah and arguing in favour of the conceptual understandings of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. They are prepared to utilize the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, which they themselves refute in order to defend their affirmation of certain attributes. However, to refute Ahl us-Sunnah, they have no problems in using the very same underlying argument - even if they consider it to be baseless. To get <u>a real good grasp on this issue</u> and <u>to truly fathom the great fraud</u> in this one sentence, your are unfortunately going to have to stop right here and do a whole load of reading and a whole load of understanding from all of these articles here (sorry!):    <P>

And after these articles the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> was forced to acknowledge that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> indeed rejects the meanings of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> (divisibility) upon their established meanings in the language of the Qur'aan and the language of the Arabs.

No harm if you continue without reading all of the above.    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So your mentioning of the word awsaf (adjectives-attributes) is deception.</blockquote>    <P>
On the contrary, this claim of yours is deception and is <u>outright academic and intellectual fraud</u> as has preceded from the likes of <a href='tags/at-tirmidhee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tirmidhee</font></a> (d. 279H), al-Baqillani (d. 403H), <a href='tags/al-khateeb-al-baghdaadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee</font></a> (d. 463H) and Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H) - <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see their quotes in the first part of this article</a> - so fear Allaah!    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>All of the people of the language do not understand from wajh, 'ayn, janb, and qadam except that which are composed parts (ajza). </blockquote>    <P>
Thank you for confirming that you are the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> in reality and that the <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> originated with you and not with Ahl us-Sunnah, and thank you for confirming that you are in fact upon the creed of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in this regard who were the very ones refuted by the likes of al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H), and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), and the early Kullaabis for rejecting these as attributes of the essence for the very same reason you are mentioning here.    <P>
As for your constant reference to the "people of the language" then for mankind, their attributes of face, hands, eyes and so on have a particular kaifiyyah that is unique to them, and thus whatever tahdeed (definition in words) of the kaif and haqeeqah (true reality) is given is unique to the creation and cannot in any way apply to Allaah, the Most High - as is established by unequivocal and explicit texts in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And we advise the reader to go and read again all the statements we have brought in <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>Part 1</a> from the aforementioned scholars that demolishes every letter, word, sentence and paragraph of these academic and intellectual fraudsters.    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They do not understand from istiwa that means sitting except that it is a manner of placing something solid on a place.</blockquote>    <P>
Confirmation again that they do not understand what Allaah has described Himself with except in the manner of what is found in the creation, thus the <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> originates in their minds, and on that basis they are forced to <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> or <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>.     <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They [do not understand] from maji', ityan, and nuzul except movement that is particular to bodies.</blockquote>    <P>
Confirmation again that they do not understand the attributes and actions of Allaah except in the manner of created bodies. And this is the response of Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> to such presumptions of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, as occurs in "Sharh Hadeeth in-Nuzool" (p. 459):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-taymiyyah-sharh-nuzool-end-quote.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And that which it is obligatory [to speak with] definitively: Is that Allaah, there is nothing that is a likeness to Him in everything that He has described Himself with. <u>Thus, anyone who describes Him with the likeness of the attributes of the creation in anything from amongst the things, then he is errant, definitively, absolutely</u>. Such as the one who says, "<i>He descends, undergoing motion and movement (yataharrak, yantaqil) just like a person descends from the roof to the lowest part of the house</i>" and like the saying of the one who says, "<i>His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> becomes unoccupied of Him, and so His descent is vacating one space and occupying another</i>", and this is baatil (false), it is obligatory to free the Lord from this, as has preceded.</blockquote>    <P>
And the reason why these people fall into such mistakes is because they made Tawheed to be impossible to be understood except with the language and terminology and philosophy of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, such as al-jawhar wal-'arad, through which they argued that the universe, being made up of ajsaam (bodies) that possess <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (occurrences), is itself a collection of occurrences which must have a beginning and an originator, which is Allaah.  Having made this proof to be the ultimate truth upon which Islam itself depends they were then forced to make all of their speech regarding Allaah to be nothing but a series of negations based around these same terms.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/aristotle-maqoolaat-al-ashar.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
All of Tawheed to these people is derived and based upon what is found in the above diagram. That is the origin of it all and the core of it all, and this is what they put the Ummah to trial with. Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee (d. 204H) said, as reported by as-Suyuti in Sawn al-Mantiq (1/47-48):    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1575;&#1580;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575;&#1575;&#1582;&#1578;&#1604;&#1601;&#1608;&#1575; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1578;&#1585;&#1603;&#1607;&#1605; &#1604;&#1587;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1576; &#1608;&#1605;&#1610;&#1604;&#1607;&#1605; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1604;&#1587;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1585;&#1587;&#1591;&#1608;&#1591;&#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1587;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The people did not become ignorant and nor differ (with each other) except due to their abandonment of the language of the Arabs and their inclination to the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is true both in the affairs of creed and in jurisprudence - for both the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> and the flawed syllogistic logic of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> corrupted both of these subjects.    <P>
Their saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for Will, Power, Life and its likes, they are the attributes of the essence (sifat al-dhat).</blockquote>    <P>
As we mentioned earlier, note that they did not explicitly mention hearing and seeing (as-sam' wal-basr) on a single occasion in their entire article, which they hold as attributes of the Essence. And the entirety of mankind, in all their varying languages and races, do not understand hearing and seeing <u>except as faculties in limbs</u>, and these faculties do not exist, ever, in other than limbs. So they were careful not to explicitly mention hearing and seeing, which are the two attributes that Allaah mentioned in the very verse, "<b>There is nothing like unto Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b> (42:11)" - because they know that the reader would understand the weakness in the claimed distinction, rather the fraud in the claimed distinction.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
The contemporary <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> refuse to understand whatever Allaah has revealed in His Book and His Messenger's Sunnah of Attributes except upon the kaifiyyah and haqeeqah (true reality) of what is found in the creation. This is <u>very apparent and clear</u> in what they have stated above and as such they are the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> in reality.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> are those who do not understand what Allaah has affirmed for Himself except with the presumption of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>. Thereafter they take two different paths and split into two groups.     <P>
<ul><li><u>The first group</u> affirms the Attributes in this manner, thinking there is no way to believe in these texts, to affirm these Attributes, and to affirm these attributes exist in reality <u>unless</u> they are just like our attributes. So they say they  must be like our attributes, and thus their saying, "<i>Hand like our hand</i>", "<i>Hearing like our hearing</i>", "<i>Face like our face</i>" and so on. So they presumed <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in their hearts and  minds, and then they corroborated it with their statements of affirmation, likening Allaah's Attributes with those of the creation.    <P>
<li><u>And the second group</u>, after clearly believing that these attributes cannot be anything other than limbs and parts, then go on to deny them, and resort to figurative explanations of them. So they also made the presumption of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in their hearts and minds first, and then they tried to escape and flee from what they presumed and imagined in their hearts and thus they fled towards <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> to escape the repugnance and filth that emanated in their hearts. However these people then try to throw their own repugnance and filth upon those who affirm what Allaah affirmed for Himself whilst knowing and believing that there is no likeness between the Attributes of Allaah and those of the creation.</ul>     <P>
Both these paths were condemned by the Salaf, and despite them appearing to be opposites - <u>the origin of them both is actually the same</u> - they have the same intermediate step that leads them into their separate ways - and that is <u>the presumption that the revealed texts contain that which is <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and tashbeeh</u> - and this presumption is very clearly explained in the Ash'arite textbooks, where they state that every text that gives the presumption of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> must be figuratively explained, or it's meaning nullified - and this can be found, by way of example in al-Bayjuri's marginal commentary on "Jawharat ut-Tawheed", one of their major textbooks.</div>    <P>
Further, these people tried to commit intellectual fraud - and they have been exposed in broad daylight - by trying to claim that the attributes such as Face, Hands and Eyes etc. are not "<a href="tags/sifaat.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">sifaat</font></a>", and we brought statements from their <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a>, such as al-Baqillani (d. 403H) and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H), and also from those they fraudulently claim are Ash'aris, such as Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) and al-Khatib al-Bagdhad (d. 463H) - free are these scholars from the creed of these contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - and we quoted from Imaam at-Tirmidhi (d. 279H) who was quoting the consensus of the Imaams of the Salaf - and all of them affirmed these Attributes as <u>Sifaat Dhaatiyyah</u> and explained that it was the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who rejected these as Attributes upon the presumption of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and invented ta'weels in order to reject these attributes and explain them away.    <P>
Inshaa'Allaah, to aid and support them upon birr and taqwaa (piety and righteousness) we will be writing up a recommended repentance for them. Sincere advice to contemporary Ash'aris - we suggest you actually learn and understand what the early Kullaabi Ash'ari creed was, once you overcome the hurdle and actually do that - you won't be looking at <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> the same way ever again. It is a very scary prospect for you, we understand. <P>
