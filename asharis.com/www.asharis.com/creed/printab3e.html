<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Please do not proceed with this article unless and until you have read the series in sequence. We have provided a summary below as a recap of what has preceded:    <P>
 <blockquote>In <b><a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>Part 1</a></b> we outlined a framework (indicating eleven groups to be aware of and to distinguish between), in <b><a href=index3639.html?emuan>Part 2</a></b> we established the true position of the Salaf and some from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, such as <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers in relation to 'uluww and the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (those attributes known through revealed text alone). In <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 3</a></b>, we established that the Mu'attilah and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were led to their <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> respectively because they are operating upon <u>the same foundations</u>, which is the language of <u>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</u> and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (origination of bodies). <b>Part 3 is really crucial to this entire series</b>. In <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 4</a></b> we looked at the Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and saw how, <u>upon their ilm al-kalaam</u>, concluded Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and subsequently described Him with associated descriptions, entering into <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> [upon the understanding of the Ahl al-Kalaam] and takyif through that. This is in addition to what they inherited of the tasbhih of the very early Raafidah in deification of some from the creation. We also also saw the battle in <u>the language of words</u> between them (the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and Mu'attilah) and that it all emanates from the same underlying framework. Then in <b><a href=index7b43.html?fenha>Part 5</a></b>, we looked at the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who are the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>. Again, they were operating upon the same <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and trying to corroborate the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and that is what led them to their <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, and describing Allaah with something of the takyif that leads on from that <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, particularly in the subject of <i><a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a></i> and <i>al-'uluww</i>. We also alluded to the refutations against these people by others from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> who affirmed <i>al-'uluww</i> and the <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i> (such as <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers). All of this serves as material constituting a background in the setting of which the pseudo-Ash'ari neo-Jahmi <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> swindle should start to crumble and dissolve inshaa'Allaah.</blockquote> </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background</font>    <P>
It is essential for you to read <b><a href=index27fd.html?jbmfi>Part 3</a></b> and to comprehend it well and it is something you need to keep in mind throughout this series. Basically, the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are one family. They are all united by:    <P>
<blockquote><b>a)</b> the underlying language [al-ajsaam wal-a'raad] <b>b)</b> operating upon false analogies for Allah upon which the language of their theology rests entirely and <b>c)</b> operating upon the proof of <u>huduth al-ajsaam</u> (demonstrating origination of the universe). </blockquote>    <P>
They are one united family. They are in the same box. In the same Kalam cage. They started fighting over the <u>implementation and rendition</u> of the proof of <b>huduth al-ajsaam</b>. As a result some were led to <u><a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a></u> (divestment of <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions). They are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maaturidiyyah. And some were led to <u><a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a></u> (declaring Allaah to be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, upon the particular definition(s) of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> for "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>"). They are the Raafidees and the Hanafi Karraamees.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Those who were led to <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> bickered over what conforms to and what clashes with the proof.  Hence, the differences between the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maaturidiyyah with respect to names, attributes and actions. They use false terms such as "a'raad (non-permanent incidental attributes)" and "hawaadith (events, occurrences)" to refer to Allah's attributes and actions respectively and consider that affirming them renders Allaah a "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>" (upon their innovated definitions for that term). So they started having bust-ups about what can and cannot be affirmed for Allaah without invalidating the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. Their brethren, the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> went in the other direction. They argued that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) and then some of them said "<i>but not a body like the bodies</i>" and others said "<i>a body like the bodies</i>" for reasons that were explained in the respective articles about them. So they fell into <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (i.e. making Allah a body, upon the definition of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> for it) and they followed that with language of takyif (Allaah has width, height, breadth, colour, taste, smell and so on). </blockquote></div>    <P>
However, despite these two different directions, they are all disputing with each other about <u>who has validated the proof and who has corrupted the proof</u>. Each one thinks he is right. They are all agreeing to the basic framework of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> and its premises. They are just fighting over who has connected all the dots for it and who hasn't, and who has corrupted the proof and who has validated it. This <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> that some of these people (the  Mu'attilah) were accusing others from within their "kalaam family",  is <u>not known</u> to the Salaf. This is a purely a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> thing. The Salaf only warned against <u>tashbeeh and tamtheel</u>, which is resembling or likening the realities (haqaa'iq) of what Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him of meanings to the realities of what is in the creation. That is what the Salaf warned against. And they never ever indulged in that condemned <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> such that they should have any of that innovated speech regarding al-ajsaam wal-a'raad (bodies and their incidental attributes).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Warning: The Hanbali <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> Who Misrepresented the Creed of Imaam Ahmad</b>     <P>
<blockquote>There were certain <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who came 150 years after <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and who kept company with the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. Under that influence they misrepresented Imaam Ahmad's statements on belief and ascribed to him the language of this condemned <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. None of this has been reported by any of the well-known associates of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and how numerous they are. So they ascribed to him this language of "Allaah is not a body and whoever says Allaah is a body...." and so on. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is free of this speech. When it is the case that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> spoke of Husayn al-Karaabeesee (former associate of Imaam al-Shaafi'ee) with extremely harsh words ("<i>may Allaah humiliate and expose the khabeeth</i>", "<i>do not speak with him or to whoever speaks with him</i>", "<i>the successor to Bishr al-Mareesi</i>", "<i>innovator</i>", "<i>he is in need of a beating</i>") for speaking on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> through <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, then do you think <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> would enter into this type of speech of the condemned <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>? However, these <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, who are the family of al-Tamimis, in particular Abu al-Fadl al-Tamimi (d. 410H), ascribed things to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> not through direct verbatim citation, but by putting their own  understandings onto his statements using the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, which they had taken from mixing with <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, in particular al-Baaqillaani (d. 403H) the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, and then presenting this as the speeech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and they are 150 years at least, after him. None of that is reported through the very close associates of Ahmad like al-Khallaal and Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee and all the others. So <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and the entirety of the Salaf for that matter, are free and innocent of that speech. So <u>do not be deceived</u> by whatever comes through those Tamimis and by the action of those who strove to gather the statements of these Tamimis in order to support their own <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> beliefs. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is exonerated and free of that and it is in plain contradiction to what is well-known from him and his greatest of associates and companions. The Tamimis are just one set of numerous amongst the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who deviated to certain degrees. We have <a href=index037e.html?fsxrr>a whole article</a> on those <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> who deviated from the way of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. Also From them was <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (d. 453H) who was a Kullaabi (as a result of which he held certain positions on the Qur'aan) and he also exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) through his acceptance of fabricated or very weak narrations, in addition to whatever <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> influence entered upon him.</blockquote> </div>    <P>
This now brings us to our topic, which is the <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> of <b>the Extremist Sufis</b>. We already discussed <b>the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, Mushabbihah</b> and <b>the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> Mukayyifah</b>. We want to complete this section with the Extremist Sufis. Now these Sufis are not coming from the angle of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, from the angle of this proof "huduth al-ajsaam", their <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih is from a different angle, and it is worthy to include them here, because it fits into the general purpose of this series of articles.    <P>
These Sufis often go unmentioned in many of the polemical debates that take place on these issues and in this article we will see the nifaaq (hypocrisy) that comes from todays pseudo-Ash'aris being highlighted and we will show that alongside their allegations of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih against the people of hadith, sunnah and aathaar, and their claimed defence of what they think is the truth, it is hard to believe it is genuine, because there are facts and factors. Because, lets say you were really motivated by defense of the religion (in attacking those so called "nasty, evil Salafi Mujassims"), then in that case, your speech against the Extremist Sufis should be multiple times more abundant and severe, because there is such repugnant speech, nay, plain manifest kufr, that it is simply <u>NOT</u> possible for you [pseudo-Asharis] to remain silent about them, or for your speech about them to be dwarfed by your speech about Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Hadeeth wal-Athar, which is what  your blogs, forums and websites are filled with.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Distinguishing the Extremist Sufis (Huloolis, Ittihaadees) From Others</font>    <P>
It is very important that we distinguish between the Extremist (Ghulaat) Sufis from others and not paint them all with the same brush. As not all Sufis hold the beliefs of <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a> and <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a>. Just as it is important to understand that there are many who tried to defend those Extremist Sufis and their sayings, but they did not really fathom the reality of what those Extremist Sufis really intended, and they found ways to explain away their statements.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How Did <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a> and <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> Emerge Amongst Sufis</font>    <P>
This is a subject on its own, and we only want to make some quick indications here. So here goes (simply speaking) about those expressing and speaking with this belief, implied or explicit:    <P>
<blockquote>Some of them came early in Islamic history, in the third century hijrah, and it appears they had foreign influences, and these emanationist philosophies - [Allaah manifested Himself into existence and all existence is but Him and that this was a means of manifestation of His attributes which otherwise could not find any expression or recognition] - were already found amongst the Persians, Hindus, and the Kabbalist Jews, but in the fifth century onwards, these same ideas became more popular for certain reasons.     <P>
Basically when the polemical debates were taking place between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (like Ibn Sina) and the Mutakallimin (mainly the Ash'arites), there were people who were looking at these two groups, and there were debates about time [zamaan] (in relation to the eternity of origination of the univese) and space [makaan], and about Allaah's attributes, and His unity and so on. These people could not deciper the truth, were confused (philosophically) and they just merged everything together, what the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> were saying and what the Mutakallimin were saying, and they said  "<b>Forget you lot... we are just going to treat everything as one and the same</b>." Hence, all existence is now just one thing, in time, space, entity, attributes and so on, and this is the greatest truth. But this was  more from a philosophical angle in light of the debates of the Philosphers and Mutakallimin, since the actual belief of <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a> and <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> was already in existence in the Ummah (and in previous nations).   Now what pushed these people in this direction is that when they saw the writings of the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (mostly) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> who had been diseased by the books of <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> [and the Baatinees (Ikhwan al-Safaa) and Abu Hayyaan al-Tawhidi as occurred to al-Ghazali] and this started manifesting in their books as an philosophical, illuminist, gnostic, baatinee type of Sufism, it became the doorway to the sayings of wahdat al-wujood. That by spiritual discipline and exercise, you can perish and dissolve from your current existence and become one with "the Truth", which is Allaah, which is everything, that you become united with Him and take on all of His attributes, you become His attributes, since His attributes are all that exist and you are from that existence. So this particular philosophical angle fused with that pre-existing emanationist philosophy.    <P>
These people brought the greatest of trials to Islam and its people and we see it manifest today where we see many people coming to Islam from different religions which have a similar gnostic, illuminist, philosophical tradition, and they are straight away drawn to this type of Extremist Sufism - and the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> aqidah goes alongside it, because very often, they are drawn to this through <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and his writings and he was affected by the Baatiniyyah, Abu Hayyaan al-Tawhidi and the writings of Ibn Sinaa  (d. 429H) - even if he himself refuted Ibn Sinaa in certain areas, he nevertheless got diseased as is clear in his writings, as was said by his student Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi (not to be confused by Muhammad bin Ali Ibn Arabi al-Taa'eee who is discussed further below) that "<i>al-Ghazali entered the belly of philosophy and tried to get out of it but was unable</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
So now lets look at this gross <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tasbhih which is of the worst kind in its implication, and it also has alongside it, the greatest of Shirk too. You need to remember that the intent behind the "spirituality" of these Extremist Sufis is to eventually acquire the attributes of Allaah. You will then understand that those who have supposedly reached this station are given the qualities of Ruboobiyyah and are said to have control over the creation and they are labelled as "gates", "doorways", "poles", "axes" to the higher truth and to the true and real Tawhid! The citations below are from the excellent work "<i>Aqidah al-Sufiyyah Wahdat al-Wujood al-Khafiyyah</i>" by Dr. Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Aziz al-Qaseer (Maktabah al-Rushd, 1st edition, 2003).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu Yazeed al-Bistaamee (d. 261H)</font>    <P>
He is considered by many to be the first to spread the idea of wahdat al-wujood in the Muslim world and which was already common in other places like Persia. However, as is explained by the Scholars, this belief was already found prior to him, except that these extremist Sufis only gradually revealed the reality of their aqidah until Abu Yazid was the first to openly express it and say "I have come out of the truth to the truth" and he would call out "O you who is me." Al-Bistaamee spoke  of al-Ittihaad (divine union) and resembled Himself with the creator and described Himself as the deity. He said as cited by Abdullah bin Alee al-Toosee in his book al-Luma' (p. 461):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah raised me [up] once in front of Him and said, "O Abu Zayd, my creatures would love to see you." So I said, "Adorn me with your unicity (wahdaaniyyah) and clothe me with your beingness (anaaniyyah, meaning so I can say "<i>Anaa huwa</i>" [I am Him (Allaah)]), and raise me to your oneness (ahadiyyah), until when your creation see me they will say, "We have seen you," and it will be you who is there (in  my place) and I will not be here (in this place)."</blockquote>     <P>
This is one of many sayings and it is corroborated by Sufis who have written commentaries on his statements and who explain with the clear <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a>. There was a book compiled called "<i>Al-Nur min Kalimaat Abu Tayfoor</i>" written by al-Sahlaki in which the statements of al-Bistaamee were recorded.    <P>
He was once asked about his own condition and he said, "Abu Yazeed has died, may Allaah not have mercy upon him", and what he means is that there is a voluntary death (with these Extreme Sufis) choose and this is their becoming one with Allah (al-fanaa').    <P>
In desiring to be described with the wahdaaniyyah of Allaah and Allaah's existence and all of Allaah's attributes, and thinking these affairs had come together in him, he would say, "Subhaanee, Subhaanee (glorified and sublime be me), how great is my affair, sufficient am I for myself, sufficient I am."    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Husayn bin Mansur al-Hallaaj (d. 309H)</font>    <P>
There is much reported about al-Hallaaj, in particular his poetry, in which he explicitly states <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a> (divine union) and <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> (divine indwelling). He said (in poetry):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>I am the who loves and the one who loves is I. We are one soul we have occupied a body. So when you see me, you have seen Him. And when you have seen Him, you have seen us.</i></blockquote>    <P>
And he also said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is no difference between me and my Lord except in two attributes, our existence (derived from His) and being established through Him.</blockquote>    <P>
He also said (in poetry):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Sublime is the one manifested His humanity (al-Nasut), the secret of His penetrating divinity (al-Lahut). Then He emerged manifestly in His creation, in the form one who eats and drinks. Until His creation saw Him with the [vision of the] eyes.</i></blockquote>    <P>
These are found in his book <i>al-Tawwaaseen</i>, and they are all statements of <a href='tags/ittihaad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ittihaad</font></a>, <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> and what they comprise of tasbheeh, resembling  Allaah to His creation and vice versa, which is inclusive, upon the language and terminology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu Haamid al-Ghazaali (d. 505H) [al-Ash'ari]</font>    <P>
Al-Ghazaali was someone who moved between <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, philosophy, baatiniyyah, and tasawwuf and had much contradiction in his views. He was affected by the Ikhwaan al-Safaa (Baatinee Ismaa'eelees), Abu Hayyaan al-Tawhidi and Ibn Seenaa's works. <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Ghazali</font></a> was also  caller to this belief and this is found in his works "<i>Iyaa Uloom al-Din</i>" and also "<i>Miskhaat al-Anwaar</i>." In al-Ihyaa, he quotes often from Abu Yazeed al-Bistaamee and al-Hallaaj, and his book <i>al-Mishkaat</i>, became an essential component for anyone wishing to construct and doctrine of <i>wahdat al-wujood</i>  (unity of existence). Prior to <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, these Extreme Sufis were seen as opposers to the Sharee'ah, but when <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> came along, he merged the Sharee'ah with tasawwuf and tasawwuf with the Sharee'ah and from that time these Sufis were afforded a lofty station.    <P>
These are some of his statements from <i>Ihyaa Uloomm al-Din</i> (4/270):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is not in existence - after tahqeeq (meaning verification, in reality) - except Allah and His actions.</blockquote>    <P>
And after mentioning that <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> has four levels and that the fourth is to not see anything in existence except what is one (waahid) and that this is referred to as al-fanaa (perishing, expiiring) by the Sufis, which is a person he sees nothing in except a singular whole in the creation, he does not see himself and nor creation. He says, this person is the true Monotheist, because he does not see everything around him (heavens, earth, sees, trees, the entire creation) except as oneness. He says that this is the ultimate goal of secret knowledge and sudden enlightenment (al-kashf) and this type of knowledge cannot be gleaned from books and cannot be circulated as spreading the secret of Ruboobiyyah (which is the unity of existence) is disbelief! He then answer  a question as to how can everything be one, when what we see are many varying entities. He says from one angle they are many, but from another angle they are waahid (one, singular). He then says (4/245):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it was to this <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> that al-Husayn bin Mansur al-Hallaaj indicated.</blockquote>    <P>
He also says in al-Ihyaa (4/328), speaking about the verse "<b>He loves them and they love Him</b>" (5:54) and quoting one of the Soofees that when this verse was recited to him, he said, "In truth He loves them, for He does not love except Himself" and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> commented:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Upon the meaning that He is the whole (al-kull), and that there is nothing in existence except Him.</blockquote>    <P>
He also says in Miskhat al-Anwar (p. 69):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is nothing in existence except Allaah, and everything perishes except His face... so existence is only the face of Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
He says in another place (3/281):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the meaning of Ruboobiyyah is being single out with existence, through the path of independence. For sharing in existence is a deficiency no doubt. And the one singled out in existence is Allaah, the Exalted, since there is no existent besides Him.</blockquote>    <P>
He considers <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to be affirming existence only for Allaah and denying there is any existence alongside Him, which would entail Shirk and affirming deficiences for Allaah.    <P>
He says in Miskhaat al-Anwaar (p. 79):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Laa ilaah illallaah</i> is the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the commoners, and "<i>laa huwa illa huwa</i>" is the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the elite, because this is more specific and inclusive, more truthful and  more precise and it enters its utterer (who believes it) into pure oneness, pure unicity.</blockquote>    <P>
And he explains <i>laa huwa illaa huwa</i> to be an indication of what can be pointed at and that there is nothing that can be pointed at (in existence) except He (Allaah), and that this is the real <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, the true reality of all realities (same page). These words and explanations are clear that what they intend is that affirming "existence" for other than Allaah is speaking with "duality of existence" (ithnayniyyah) which is "kufr."    <P>
There are many, many statements which <u>are very clear and explicit</u> and our aim here is not to exhaust these citations, but simply to point out that whilst this vile aqidah was present before <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, he helped to  make it mainstream and helped many of the zanaadiqah (heretics) to gain acceptance amongst the people. This is why it has been said, that <i>Mishkaat al-Anwaar</i> in which al-Ghazaali gives an explanation of the verse "<b>Allaah is the light of the heavens and the earth</b>" (24:35) with a Baatinee explanation, that this book is one of the crucial components for the madhhabb of the Ittihaadees who speak with the unity of existence. Al-Ghazaali became "<u>the Hujjah of the Zanaadiqah</u>" and of the grossest and most disbelieving of <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>.    <P>
And this necessitates the worst and most repugnant type of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (upon the terminology and understand of the Ahl al-Kalaam), and resembling Allaah to His creation.

And this is what indicates <u>the nifaaq</u> (in action) of these people and is what brings their edifice crumbling down on top of them, and we will expand upon this disgrace at the right place in what is to follow in this series inshaa'Allaah. You will see that fake sense of piety and that spurious "zeal" for the claimed "defense of the religion"  when these cowardly people slander the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah upon the flimsiest of pretexts and accuse them of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih when they pretend to be blind to what is in the books of al-Ghazaali (and others) of the greatest of calamities.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn al-Faarid (d. 632H)</font>    <P>
This mulhid, zindeeq (heretic) is referred to as the <i>Sultan al-Aashiqeen</i>, the leader of the infatuated lovers. He entered Sufism, became well-known and was counted as the "qutb (pole, axis)" of his era. He never authored any works but he left poetry behind in which his thoughts and beliefs were expressed. This poetry is said to be sweet, slick and eloquent but it is laced with the aqidah of wahdat al-wujood, and for this reason scholars like <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> referred to it as "poisoned sweet." His most well-known compositions are <i>al-Taa'iyyah al-Kubraa</i> and <i>al-Meemiyyah</i>. His "Deewaan" (composition) is published and also has an explanation by al-Nabulisi called "<i>Kashf al-Sirr al-Ghaamid Fi Sharh Deewaan Ibn al-Faarid</i>." Now there are many, many lines of poetry in that which indicate without any doubt that he is speaking with the same as his ancestors in this belief (like <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, al-Hallaaj and al-Bistami) and we will summarize here some of the concepts found in his poetry (published as <i>Deewaan Ibn al-Faarid</i>):    <P>
<ul><li> Everything he observes is a manifestation of Allaah's existence (as in  His essence).  <li> That this is so both in the state of <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> and soberness (meaning, that this is just not a state of <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a>, in that such statements are expressed, they are in fact the actual truth).  <li> He repeats an expression "<i>dhaati bi dhaati</i>" (my essence with my essence) and he did not say "dhaatuhu bi dhaati" (His essence with my essence) or "dhaati bi dhaatihi" (my essence with His essence) because this would entail "duality of existence" which is kufr (to them), since only Allaah exists, nothing else.  <li> He considers <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, which is the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Muslims to be heresy, kufr, shirk (because it distinguishes between  Allaah and His creation and singles Him out for worship).  <li> He considers distinguishing between the created and the creator to be the greatest misguidance, rather Shirk.  <li> He believes that He and the divine essence are one single reality. He says that his interior is "al-Laahut" (meaning, divine being, essence) and what is exterior is "al-Nasut" (meaning, human being, essence). In other words a man on the outside, divine on the inside.  <li> He claims that everyone who calls upon Allaah will be answered by him (Ibn al-Faarid) and everyone who calls upon Ibn al-Faarid will be answered by Allaah, since the one being called upon in either case, is a single essence.  <li> He says he does not call upon Allaah in the second person (mukhaatab, as in addressing Him), since that would entail duality of existence, which is misguidance, kufr and shirk (to his likes).  <li> He claims that all of the rituals of worship like Hajj, Umrah and likewise the prayers, they are all directed towards hiim since He is a manifestation of the divine essence, and he also says that his own prayer is for none other than himself (i.e. worship of his self).  <li> He says all religions, despite differences and variations, are expressions of a single reality, which have a single goal, which is to gain nearness to a single essence and that all worshippers of all types are all worshipping one deity. This means according to Him that every deity worshipped by every human, is all from the divine essence.  <li> He says a man cannot love Allaah until he perishes (al-fanaa) and merges with Him, and this is only achieved through the foundational belief that the existence of the servant is the very existence of the Lord and that when the servant perishes, it is Allaah that manifests. In other words, the servant has become an actual manifestation of Allaah.  </ul>    <P>
Now, we are not concerned about the ramblings of this mulhid kaafir as much as we are concerned about the fact that <u>the writings of Abu Hamid al-Ghazaali</u> are what lured many a heretic-to-be in this direction.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Al-Ghazali is in fact <u>the Hujjah of the Zanaadiqah </u>, and that is more worthy of a description for what he left as a legacy, because his works were a reason for the doctrines for the likes of Ibn Faarid, Ibn Sab'een and others. Had it not been for the fact that it is reported about him that he turned to studying hadeeth, left <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a>, and lamented over wasting his life, we would not have asked Allaah to pardon him and forgive him. However, we don't withhold from saying the truth that his books are the doorway to the type of heresy you see from Ibn al-Faarid and Ibn Arabi. As for whatever good he had, that is between him and Allaah, and we ask Allaah to pardon him. But he left a heritage which serves as a doorway to that misguidance, and it is from benevolence and mercy to <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> that his books be warned against. <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Ghazali</font></a> was refuted and spoken of by:    <P>
<ul><li><b>Abu Bakr bin al-Arabi</b> (his own student) who said "<i>al-Ghazali entered the belly of philosophy, then tried to escape but was not able</i>." He also cited views of al-Ghazaali which were the views of the Baatiniyyah.  <li> <b>Abdullaah al-Maaziree</b> (wrote a book)  <li> <b>Abu al-Hasan al-Murgheenaanee</b> (refuted his speech in Mishkaat al-Anwar)  <li> <b>Abu Amr bin al-Salaah</b>, the Muhaddith, who warned against his speech  <li> <b><a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a></b> likewise  <li> <b>Ibn Aqeel</b> (a Hanbali who got diseased by the views of Mu'tazilee teachers)  <li> <b>Ibn al-Jawzee</b> (a Hanbali who was upon tajahhum, i'tizaal and general confusion and bewilderment regarding the attributes)</ul>    <P>
Don't also be surprised that the philosophy and teachings of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> strike a chord with people from many religions for reasons that should be plain and obvious. Allaah knows best what the likes of <u>Imaam Malik</u>, <u>Imaam al-Shaafi'ee</u> and <u><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a></u> would have done to <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> had he been in their presence. It is important to point this out about the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and others) and put them in the time of those Imaams, so that so that the hearts of the people can  recognize what difference there is between the firmly-grounded, deeply-rooted  mountains of knowledge, and the confused, misguided, straying wanderers, lost in every valley for almost all their lives. This, so that the people remained attached to the righteous Salaf, not those who spent the majority of their life upon <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> and views and opinions of zandaqah. And as for the benefit in their books, it is dwarfed by what is found of huge benefit in the books of those besides them who were safe and sound in their belief and methodology.</div>    <P>
So Ibn al-Faarid is from the greatest of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, a wandering straying misguided mulhid. And today's pseudo-Ash'arites should be happy to know that his <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and tashbih is a result of what the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> [who was hopping from kalam to <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> to baatiniyyah to ittihaadiyyah and so on...] had concocted of his illuminist sufi baatini philosophy through which he gave those heretics after him a wide open door to enter upon the people of Islaam with their kufr, ilhaad and zandaqah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Arabi al-Taa'ee (d. 638H)</font>    <P>
Muhammad bin Alee Ibn Arabi al-Haatimee al-Taa'ee (an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> in  creed) is from the greatest of the callers to the unity of existence, however, he displayed a lot of cunning, and many of these people knew that the supposed "dumb common folk" and their scholars [those who are not privileged with that special realization of the truth which cannot be known through the sent messengers and revealed books but only through secret illumination] would see their statements as pure kufr. For this reason, <u>they inserted layers of interpretation in their speech as a veil</u>, so that no matter who they were addressing, they would all consider it to be a truth that can be interpreted according to the view and opinion of whoever comes across it. Or they spoke with speech addressed to the people with what the people saw as truth (regarding matters of belief, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and so on) from the perspective of "speak to the dumb commoners with speech that is appropriate for them and their level." Hence, they would seemingly contradict and rebut their other statements, whereas in reality they were simply speaking different "truths" for different people, with the highest truth being that ilhaad, zandaqah, kufr and shirk which they taught only through initiation or through subtlety of expression if outright expression was not possible. For this reason whilst a very large number of scholars made takfir of Ibn Arabi, there are still found till this day, those who defend him and explain his statements, without really fathoming the reality of this man and his philosophy, because they never had the perspicacity to see through the cunning of the likes of these people.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Those who made takfir of Ibn Arabi include:    <P>
<blockquote>Ibn Hajar al-Asqalaani and his shaykh, Siraaj al-Din al-Balqeenee, Zayn al-Din al-Iraaqee and his son, Wali al-Din al-Iraaqee, Imaam <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a>, Abd al-Rahman bin Khaldun, Badr al-Din Ibn Jamaa'ah (an Ash'ari), Shams al-Din al-Jazari, Muhammad al-Jazaree, Alee bin Ya'qub al-Bakree, Muhammad bin Aqeel al-Baalusee, Ibn Hishaam, the author of <i>Awdah al-Masaalik Fee Alfiyyah Ibn Maalik</i>, Shams al-Din al-Eezaree, 'Alaa al-Din <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> al-Hanafee, Shams al-Din al-Mawsilee </blockquote>    <P>
There are in total around 50 scholars who have collectively either made takfir of him, or severely condemned and rebuked him, and it includes scholars from all orientations and madhhabs.</div>    <P>
Ibn Arabi has two famous books "<i>Fusoos al-Hikam</i>" and "<i>al-Futuhaat al-Makkiyyah</i>" which have received much attention in terms of explanation. We can summarize the core beliefs that come from these books:    <P>
<ul><li> Ibn Arabi does not believe in creation from non-existence. He believes that this universe is a constant emanation of the divine, that Allaah manifested in the forms and shapes of all what is in the universe, rather He is the universe and the universe is Him and there is no other existence.  <li>Everything perceived by the human senses is the manifestation of Allaah Himself, that is the greatest of all realities which distinguishes between the informed, enlightened, and the rank ignoramus.  <li> The enlightened, informed person is the one who sees Allaah in every thing, rather He is the very essence ('ayn) of everything.  <li> He considers this creation to be an illusion and that Allaah is the only reality.  <li> He considers all the attributes of the creation to be the very attributes of Allaah, even those attributes that contain deficiency and blame. He says this explicitly, "Do you not see that al-Haqq (Allaah) appears in the attributes of the originated things, and He informed about this regarding Himself, and [likewise] with the attributes of deficiency (naqs) and the attributes of blame (dhamm)." <i>Fusus al-Hikam</i> with explanation of al-Qaashaani (p. 84). He went further and also said Allaah is also decribed with the attributes of non-existing things (al-ma'dumaat) and the impossible things (al-mumtani'aat) a few pages later (p. 88).  <li> He says that whilst Allah manifests Himself in all of creation, His most perfect and most beautiful manifestation is in women, and that this is why the Messenger (alayhis salaam) used to love women. <i>Fusus al-Hikam</i> with explanation of al-Qaashaani (p. 333).  <li> Following on from the above beliefs Ibn Arabi also expressed the unity of religions (all different paths to same goal, and everything worshipped by all religions is Allaah, hence all have something of the truth, and collectively it is all truth).  </ul>    <P>
Ibn Arabi left around 400 works and in all of these works, which spanned most of his life, he continued to outline and spread this doctrine. However, initially, he was cautious about it. He excuses himself in <i>al-Futuhaat al-Makkiyyah</i> (tahqiq Uthman Yahyaa, 3/226) that we will not bring all matters due to weak minds not being able to grasp it, so he alluded to things and developed his ideas with caution. His book Fusus al-Hikam was written after (in the year 627H) whilst in Damascus, and in this book he was more explicit.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Some of the latecomers have tried to claim that some of these statements have been fabricated upon Ibn Arabi, and these claims are falsified by the fact that complete manuscripts of <i>al-Futuhat al-Makkiyyah</i> (in 37 volumes) were found in the writing of Ibn Arabi himself and likewises <i>Fusus al-Hikam</i> has a manuscript in the handwriting of Muhammd al-Qunuwi, the student of Ibn Arabi.</div>    <P>
So what greater <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a>, and tashbih and kufr is there in the likes of these statements which are simply an extension of what came from those before him, since Ibn Arabi brought nothing new. However, he was from the greatest of callers to this repugnant doctrine, using layers of deception in his writings, until many have been deceived into defending this man.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Sab'een (d. 669H)</font>    <P>
Ibn Sab'een was from al-Andalus where he studied philosophy, logic, magic and took the way of the Sufis. He was expelled from there in 640H due to his evil belief and he and his followers moved to al-Maghrib (Morocco). He would spread his belief  by moving around from town to town but rejection was shown against him and he turned towards Egypt. However, the people of al-Maghrib had sent a messenger to Egypt warning them of Ibn Sab'een and when he did not get acceptance from them he turned to Makkah. He remained in Makkah and under protection and encouragement from the ruler there (Abu Numay), he was active in his da'wah. Howeer, the scholars of Makkah rejected his Sufism, and he tried to leave for India but eventually preferred to stay in Makkah. The historians mention he died of suicide by cutting his own wrists in the year 669H.    <P>
He has numerous books <i>Budd al-Ma'aarif</i>, <i>al-Masaail al-Saqaliyyah</i>, <i>al-Ihaatah</i>, <i>al-Alwaah</i>, <i>al-Tawajjuh</i>, <i>al-Risalah al-Nuriyyah</i>. His writings are published with the title "<i>Rasaa'il Ibn Sab'een</i>" and we can quickly summarize some points:    <P>
<ul><li>Ibn Sab'een expressed this same belief but through concise expressions, he would say there is wujood mutlaq (absolute existence) which is Allaah, then wujood muqayyad (restricted existence) and wujood muqaddar (future existence). He says the second two are mere imagination, with no real existence, and that there is nothing in reality. There is only Allaah's existence which is real.  <li>He also said there is no description for Allaah except the very existence of every existing thing. Meaning all is Allaah and is a description of Him.   <li>He would point to a dog and say this too is not outside of Allaah's essence, that all things are from His essence.   <li>He said that Allah's name al-Dhaahir, means Allaah is the very entity of every existing thing, hence He "manifests", hence the name.   <li>He and his followers would say "Laysa illa huwa" (There is none but He) instead of "Laa ilaaha illallaah" (There is none worthy of worship except He).  </ul>    <P>
Ibn Sab'een never really had a strong effect on the Sufis (as did Ibn Arabi) because he tended to be very subtle in propounding his ideas. Again, we see this vile <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> alongside what it contains of kufr and shirk.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abdul-Ghaniyy al-Nabulsi al-Hanafi [al-Maturidi] (d. 1143H)</font>    <P>
He was a Hanafi Maturidi and he studied <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, tasawwuf and other sciences in Damascus, he was upon the way of Ibn 'Arabi and Ibn al-Faarid and Ibn Sab'een who found a route to that way through the writings of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>. He spent seven years in his own house, not leaving it, as part of the Sufi khalwa (isolation) and left the Jumu'ah and the Jamaa'ah, and was involved in Sufi spiritual exercises (aimed at perishing and becoming "one"). When he acquired that certainty (of wahdat al-wujood) he then left his house and then travelled to other places, to visit the shrines of the Sufis and to connect with the aqtaabs (poles) and the likes.    <P>
He has many works, including <i>Eedaah al-Maqsud min Ma'na Wahdat al-Wujood</i>, <i>Sharh Deewaan Ibn al-Faarid</i>, <i>al-Wujud al-Haqq</i> and others. From his beliefs, from  the books <i>al-Wujud al-Haqq</i> and <i>al-Fath al-Rabbaanee</i>:    <P>
<ul><li> There is no existence except that of Allaah, He has no partner (shareek) in existence. He stated that every existing thing is Allaah.  <li> He had many expressions stating that the creator and created are a single entity.  <li> He said that divine essence has an inner (baatin) and outer (dhaahir), and that the inner is an absolute existence (wujud mutlaq) and the outer is the creation and that the absolute existence has come into existence and manifested through this observed creation.  <li> He says that everything besides Allaah, the Exalted, are forms (suwar) established with Allaah, not something other than Him.  <li> He also says that there is nothing in existence except the dhaat (essence), the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes), the attributes of the attributes (which are the actions) and munfa'ilaat (meanin the univerese). So these are four things. He then says, the first is the deity, the second is what connects to Him, the third is the worshipper and the fourth is the impediment, barrier. Then He says the first level is Allaah, the second is the Messenger, the third is the level of the Believers, the fourth is the level of the Shaytan. And these four are all a single reality, and all of these four are the form (surah) of Allaah, the Truth.  <li> He says that what the people believe to be creation (khalq) is nothing but imagination, a mirage which can be seen from afar but is in reality nothing.  <li> He is that what the people actually see in creation, is not creation but manifestations of Allaah himself. And when this is the case, Allaah is described with everything (all the attributes) that are found in the creation.  <li> He says that those who do not believe in this wahdat al-wujud are veiled from Allaah, ignoramuses, resembling Iblees, when he refused to prostrate to Aadam not realising [as Nabulsi claims] it was in fact Allaah manifesting in Aadam(!).   <li> Rather those who do not believe in this doctrine are pagans, because they affirmed another existence alongside of Allaah (in <i>Dewaan al-Haqaa'iq</i>, in very explicit words, <span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1584;&#1610; &#1610;&#1583;&#1593;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1583; &#1605;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;  &#1601;&#1583;&#1593;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607; &#1607;&#1584;&#1607; &#1578;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1603;</span>).   </ul>    <P>
Al-Nabulsi is held highly amongst Sufis because he strove hard to promulgate this aqidah and to give explanations of the writings of the previous mulhids (like Ibn al-Faarid, Ibn Sab'een).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Rounding Up</font>    <P>
We see in all the above individuals and their statements what amounts to a <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> that is the most evil and repugnant type, it is worse than that of the Raafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and worse than that of the Hanafi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> who are from the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups, and this vile <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> never arose on account of that <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (through the proof of huduth al-ajsaam), but rather it came from the adoption of the emanationist philosophies that were already present in esoteric orders amongst the Persians, Hindus and Kabbalist Jews. And as we said before, it is necessary to distinguish between these Extremist Sufis and others whose Sufism was of a different type. When these ideas manifested and spread, the associated terminology and language was adopted by many, however, some used these expressions with a view to aligning them with correct true meanings in the Sharee'ah (like Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawaee in <i>Manaazil al-Saa'ireen</i>) and to others, they carried  and developed the heretical conceptualizations they represented. You should also note that many of these individuals had words that would contradict what they were propounding, but this was only a means of protecting themselves, and they would speak different "truths" depending on whom they were addressing.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In the fifth century there was <b>a marriage</b> between Ash'arism and this type of Tasawwuf which started with Abu al-Qaasim al-Qushayree (d. 465H) [who aligned the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed with the Sufis in general] and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) who brought in a philosophical gnostic type of Sufism and he laid down the philosophical foundations for the doctrine of wahdat al-wujood in his works (such as <i>Mishkat al-Anwar</i>) that goaded the likes of Ibn al-Arabi and Ibn al-Faarid and other zindeeqs to go in that direction. For this reason you will see <u>the most amazing and strangest of affairs</u> which indicates the nifaaq (in action) of these people present today posing as followers of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. They find statements of the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and al-Darimi and others which often have a deeper polemical context, and they isolate these statements and accuse them of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> (upon the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> definition of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> that is, which is a fabricated, innovated definition, for the purposes of their own theology). And yet when you see statements like these coming from Ash'aris like Ibn Arabi (he was an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> in creed), and likewise <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and al-Nabulsi (a Maturidi) and others, you do not see the same type of zeal and fervour in combatting this <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>, the grossest of forms. Rather, you see attempts to explain away these expression, "they mean this, they mean that", and even if we gave that to them for argument's sake, the situation is such that you will find yourself hard pressed to get a condemnation out of them for the words at least. Alhamdulillaah, you never, ever saw from any Sunni, Salafi, Athari such baatil beliefs (that's because they are upon a sound aqidah that prevents them from falling into such misguidance).</div>    <P>
Further, many of today's popular Sufis (like Nazim al-Qubrusi) are simply extensions of the likes of Ibn al-Faarid and Ibn Arabi. They are on the same belief and they believe and propound the unity of religions and also have language of gross tasbhih in their writings. So when this is the case, it is from the greatest of nifaaq (in action) that the bulk of the enmity, polemics, scorn and ridicule found amongst the pseudo-Asha'rites is directed towards the people of hadith, sunnah and aathaar (who are free an innocent of their spurious charges of "<a href="tags/tajseem.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tajseem</font></a>") and we struggle to find even a whimper on their blogs, forums, websites, podcasts, lectures, writings, works, publications speaking about the actual <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and actual <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> of the worst and most repugnant kind in language that needs no further explanation.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
In this article we covered another group amongst the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, <b>the Sufi Extremists</b> and their belief of unity of existence (wahdat al-wujood) who are worse than the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (the Raafidees and Hanafees).
