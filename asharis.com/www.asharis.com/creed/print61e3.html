<p><div class='sidebar'>This article is a brief introduction to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<a href='tags/falaasifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falaasifah</font></a>) and the Speculative <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (<a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>) and the battles between them, but is intended as a very brief introduction for now so that we have a basic overall picture of what happened historically. This needs to be understood because it allows us to have a better appreciation of many of the aqeedah positions of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and much of the deviation they fell into, and of the emergence of many positions, views and statements (in creed) that were far, far away from what the Salaf were upon.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introducing The Players</font>    <P>
We need to be familiar with the the following:    <P>
<b>The Philosophers</b>: <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (d. 332BC) is known as "the First Teacher". Abu Nasr al-Farabi (d. 339H) is known as "the Second Teacher". <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) is known as "the Third Teacher" - these are the actual titles given to them. The latter two are the inheritors of that Greek Philosophy of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (and Plato), and they championed it and their own beliefs through it. One of their main beliefs was that the "matter" that makes up the universe is eternal and has always been present and another being their rejection of bodily resurrection and the affairs connected to resurrection.    <P>
<b>The Mutakallimoon</b>: Are those who used the notions and terminology of metaphysical philosophy (of those atheists and disbelievers such as Aristotle) to argue the case for:     <P>
<ul> <li> the universe being created,   <li> the existence of a creator,   <li> the plausibility of prophethood and   <li> the plausibility of resurrection.</ul>    <P>
And they are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah. And they made this proof of theirs to be the "ultimate truth" and the premise they were working on was that the truth of Islam can only be demonstrated through this proof - and in this, they were trying to impress upon those atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. In the course of all this, they were led to the orientation - in agreement with each other despite their different sayings, and with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> whom they were battling - that the intellect is decisive and definitive over the revealed texts and that the proof of the intellect leads and the revealed text follows. They state this in their own words, and we can dedicate a separate article to that inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
Thus a common trait between the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> is that they put the intellect above and over the revealed texts and consider the proof of the intellect decisive over the revealed texts.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Concise Summary Of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Speculative <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>, Their Philosophy and <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) used an intellectual proof based around the notions of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> which many of the Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> present in the Muslim lands in that time were very familiar with - they were familiar and conversant with Greek Philosophy and that was the science and philosophy of the day. <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> (ex. 128H) was the first to use a crude form of this proof against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> called the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> likewise were upon this, they too argued with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and others, and <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> (d. 235H) was the first to really formalize it for the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> also incorporated the "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" of <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (d. 370BC) into this proof in order to improve it and through which they could argue more soundly for the entire universe being created (on account of being made of indivisible particles that are all alike). Thereafter, <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H) simply inherited or borrowed the bulk of it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and laid it down for the Ash'aris by formalizing it in his book "at-Tahmeed".     <P>
And all of this, in its roots, was based around the philosophies of the Greeks and in particular the general concepts of Aristotle's "Ten Categories", which to the Arabs were "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar".    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Aristotle's "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar"</font>    <P>
For the sake of completeness in this article we will mention the "Ten Categories" of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. These ten categories are supposed to classify everything in the universe in its essence and its qualities - hence "al-jawhar" (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>) and "al-'arad" (incidental attribute, accident).    <P>
So here are Aristotle's ten categories, the first deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol>    <P>
As you can see from the above, we are dealing here with bodies (jawaahir, ajsaam) and their incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>).    <P>
And when you look in both the books of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'aris - whose books are the most abundant from what we have of the heritage of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - then you will see that all of their metaphysical talk and the underlying roots for the elaboration of their proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" <u>derives conceptually from Aristotelian Metaphysics</u>. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> introduced the theory of <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (another Greek Philosopher)  of "<a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a>" in order to "<u>tighten up the ship</u>" a little (allowing them to argue more efficiently for the createdness of the universe), and the Ash'aris inherited all of this while differing with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on subsidiary issues regarding the proof. The metaphysical language was the underlying fabric that was common to both the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Because the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", the demonstration of the createdness of the universe, made use of metaphysical language (such as <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, makan, tahayyuz and so on) - and because the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) used this proof and its associated language to argue for certain foundations of the religion such as:    <P>
<ul><li> A Creator  <li> Prophethood  <li>Resurrection</ul>    <P>
Then they were <u>forced</u> to make all their speech about divinity and belief in Allaah through <u>a collection of negations</u> centered around <u>these same terms</u>. They  had to do this <u>in order to avoid invalidating their proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</u> which they now considered to be <u>the ultimate truth</u> and upon which the veracity of the revealed texts, of creation, prophethood and resurrection depends. Thus, when you look in all the books of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (such as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah), that's all you are going to see. They made Tawheed to be "Jawhar and 'Arad" and what follows on from it. This is not the Tawheed that the Messengers came with.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Playing and Toying With the Texts So as Not To Invalidate the Proof</font>    <P>
By using this proof, these <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> were forced to start figuratively explaining away much of what is in the revealed texts regarding belief in Allaah, since it clashed with their proof and its necessities and would have invalidated it.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As mentioned above, this proof known as "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and "hudooth ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam" - which is to argue that since qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>), incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and events, occurrences (hawaadith) are found in bodies, this proves that bodies are newly-arisen (haadithah) as they could not have put those things (sifaat, <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, hawaadith) in themselves, and are thus created. And as it is impossible for there to be "hawaadith" (occurrences) without a beginning, then it proves there is a Creator. This proof is actually false and corrupt and proves the very opposite of what they set out to prove, which is why they were forced to take the stance towards the revealed texts that they have taken.</div>    <P>
It was on account of the intellectual proof that <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> devised that he was forced to speak with the following, amongst many other things:    <P>
<ul><li><u>That Allaah did not speak to Moses</u> - because it would mean an event in Allaah's Essence, and thus making Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying His proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That the Qur'aan is created</u> - because if Allaah spoke it, it would be an occurrence or an incidental attribute, thus rendering Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and thus falsifying his proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter</u> - because if He could be seen, it would be in a direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>), as things are only seen in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>), and this would make Him a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus falsifying his proof.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah is not above the heaven</u> - because this would necessitate direction, and anything in direction must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), thus Allaah would be a body, and thus the proof would be falsified.    <P>
<li> <u>That Allaah cannot be described with anything that the creation is described with</u> - because all descriptions that we see are only found in bodies (ajsaam), thus Allaah cannot be described with anything, otherwise it would necessitate that He is a body.</ul>    <P>
And the usool (foundations) of the deen of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> have their roots in the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> Click On ...</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> such as al-Farabi (d. 339H), <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) who were really heretics, mulhids, and who intended harm to Islam and the Muslims, when they saw the corrupt nature of this proof (they were shrewd and smart people), and they recognized the flaw in it, they took it as an opportunity to attack the foundations of the religion - and these <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (al-Farabi, Ibn Sina) were scholars of the Greek philosophies of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and Plato, and they believed they were the true inheritors and champions of that philosophy.     <P>
The flaw that they saw was that by arguing through this proof, it was necessitated upon the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> that they hold that the Creator was, for "a period of eternity", doing nothing, meaning no action. Because the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> said, as part of their proof that it is impossible for there to be hawaadith (occurrences) with no beginning, they had to say that all of a sudden, without any reason or cause, after doing nothing for "a period of eternity" Allah decided to create. The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> said this is false and corrupt, and said that you have no proof from the revealed texts to prove this, and whatever proofs you bring from the revealed texts for "the creation of the matter of the universe", <u>we'll just make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of it</u> just like you are doing to the texts of the Attributes.    <P>
So basically, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, being shrewd, looked at what the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> were relying upon in their proof, found a hole in it and then used that to bolster their view that the universe is eternal.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> Said to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> in a Nutshell</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> were simply trying to use the language and terminology of the Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to prove the universe is created and the existence of a creator and so one of the main things the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (the likes of al-Farabi, Ibn Sina) were in essence saying was:     <P>
<blockquote>Hey! That philosophy is our heritage, and true philosophy is that you start with just pure intellect, rejecting everything, all knowledge and all belief, and then construct reality from that point upwards through pure intellect and philosophical principles. But you "Islamists" you are starting off with a premise that Islam is the truth so you are not real <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and this is not real philosophy. You are just opportunists who are stealing our goods and our heritage (philosophy, Aristotelian metaphysics) to support something which you have accepted blindly. We are the real <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and what we are involved in is real and true philosophy. We are the real inheritors of the philosophies (of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and Plato) while you are just pretenders.</blockquote>    <P>
So when these <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> saw the corrupt nature of this proof used by the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, they saw their opportunity and pounced. And as these <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> believed that the universe is eternal, that the Prophets just made things up to dupe the people so that they would accept faith and belief in the hereafter more easily, and that they, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves, can become "prophets" and  many other beliefs - they turned to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and said:    <P>
<blockquote>Hey! Thank you very much. As you have now made it clear that whatever is in the revealed texts of speech about Allaah and His Attributes is metaphorical and figurative, and you need to claim this in order to sustain your proof - and we'll agree with you on that (nod, nod, wink, wink to each other) - then likewise, everything in the revealed texts that speak about <u>the creation and resurrection</u>, then all of that is metaphorical and figurative, and the prophets just made it all up, and all of this supports us and what we claim that the universe is eternal, even if there is a Maker for it, it is still eternal, and the Prophets just duped the people with made up things to help them believe, and there is no such thing as "creation" and "resurrection" in reality.</blockquote>    <P>
So the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" of Jahm and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> opened up the door for these people (the Philosophers) and others such as the Qaraamitah Baatiniyyah to start assaulting Islaam and the revealed texts.     <P>
<ul><li>So <u>the Philosophers</u> would say that things like the blowing of the trumpet (as-soor), raising of the bodies and their gathering (al-hashr), the scales (al-meezaan) and the bridge (as-siraat) and all of the affairs related to resurrection, and whatever has been mentioned in that regard are all just metaphors, they are not real, they are just things made up by the Prophets who used such expressions to induce belief in the people. <b>And this sounds greatly familiar to what <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> said regarding the language used in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah to describe Allaah - <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>go and take a good, slow, reflective, read of this article, then read it again, twice, no, ten times! Then come back here and read on</a>.</b> The <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> said all this because they believed, like <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> did, that the universe is eternal, meaning that what the universe is made of, the matter, the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, has eternally been present, and that the creator simply made what we have now from that matter. And likewise that this matter will not perish, there is no destruction of everything, and no such thing as resurrection. And so they turned to all of those texts with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, just like the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> turned to the texts of the Attributes with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, whilst grinning and saying "Thank you very much" to the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>.    <P>
<li>And <u>the Qaraamitah Baatiniyyah</u> did the same to the Sharee'ah, so they said that the prayer (as-salaat) is just a metaphor what it really means is "<i>knowing our secrets</i>" or "<i>giving allegiance to our scholars</i>", and that fasting (as-sawm) is to "<i>conceal our secrets</i>" and that the pilgrimage (al-hajj) is to "<i>visit our shaykhs</i>", and they would teach this in isolation amongst themselves - and so they turned to all the actions of worship (al-ibaadaat) with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>,  explaining them away and abolishing them.</ul>    <P>
So the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> turned upon the texts of the Attributes with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tahreef, and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> turned upon the texts of creation and resurrection with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tahreef and the Baatiniyyah Qaraamitah turned upon the texts of ibaadah with <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tahreef.    <P>
And what led them, the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, into such affairs and to open up such an evil door, was that they made <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> (which they took from the likes of the Greeks, and pseudo-Sabean Harranians) to be the foundation of what is the ultimate truth - to prove the existence of a creator, and then holding that an-nadhar wal-istidlaal (inspection, observation and inference) is more or less obligatory upon every individual (i.e. to prove the existence of his Lord through these methods). And all of this is false, corrupt, for the belief in a creator is in the fitrah (innate instinct), the first obligation is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, alone.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Playing Tennis with the Philosophers</b>    <P>
A good parable for showing what happened is this: The atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> invited these people (the Mutakallimoon) to a tennis match. So the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> served first and these people agreed to play the game on the court of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, on their terms (i.e. their <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>, their terminologies and language). So these people thought it's an easy game and so they returned the ball - but they've been hitting the ball backward and forward ever since and never managed to escape the game because they were stuck with its associated <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>, with which they thought they could easily defeat those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. So that's where they've remained - stuck with that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>". And determined to win the game, they were forced to take a certain stance towards the revealed texts, and without taking that stance towards the revealed texts (ta'weel, tahreef), they would have had to withdraw from the game and admit defeat. And there was no way they were going to do that, there was too much at stake now, and so continue the game they did.</div>    <P>
And this is why it has been said, as quoted by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in Bayaan Talbees ul-Jahmiyyah from Ibn Suraij ash-Shafi'ee (d. 306H), and also reported by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi with his isnaad in "Dhamm ul-Kalaam":     <P>
Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "Dhamm ul-Kalaam" and as mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>":    <P>
