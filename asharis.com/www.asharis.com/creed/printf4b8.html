<div class='sidebar'>In this article we will comment on the antics of a slightly different species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, more conniving, slippery, and easily believed because he has the gift of the gab, thinks he's a little tasty in knowledge, and can also act very well, even if it be in the form of blogging. <b>But don't fret and be dismayed.</b> It is <i>precisely</i> this type of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> who gets <u>the greatest pounding</u> and <u>whose inner secrets are laid bare</u> with the greatest scandal. As the saying goes, "<i>the bigger they are, the harder they fall</i>", except that in this case this phrase needs to be modified to "<i>the bigger they pretend to be, the harder they fall, nevertheless</i>." This story is one of perception, perceiving things as they really are, as well as understanding the nature of kiddies school playground politics, and the psychology of emotion.    <P>
You see each <b>Jahmite Wannabe</b> has his own flavour. You get disgraced baleeds such as <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>) who lowered himself into the well of ignominy through the bucket of ignominy (<a href=index958b.html?aujtf >see here</a>) and exposed himself as a persistent, non-repentant liar with no sense of justice towards the opponent (continue lying with no shame or remorse even after you got caught out). Or you have those <a href='tags/marifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Marifah</font></a> blind-followers peddling the frauds of the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who wholly embraced the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (see   <a href=indexb1e4.html?hwmnj>here</a>, <a href=index3aed.html?mgqba>here</a>, <a href=index321f.html?nkcmd>here</a> and <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>here</a>) - stunning, deafening silence with not a whimper in response. Or others like <a href='tags/nuh-keller.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuh Keller</font></a> (see <a href=indexc1c7.html?bzrsj>here</a>). And don't forget those <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (see <a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>here</a> and <a href=index488d.html?gvutg>here</a>). There's plenty to go around, and each one draws out certain lessons. So alhamdulillah we have another victim of the <b>Tawhid of al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b> (to borrow the phrase of Ibn Surayj al-Shafi'i [d. 306H]) who will be passed through <a href=categories/the-clinic.html>our clinic</a> and then <a href=series/aristotelians-anonymous---detox-and-support-program.html>support group</a> if all else fails.</div>    <P>
After writing the above introduction, we discovered that this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> pretender has been refuted by others already (may Allah reward them), so this article need not be too long. It was not intended to focus on the narration from Imam Malik in any case, but on a much wider issue, since focusing on the odd narration here and there is from the sly tricks of these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.    <P>
First a little about this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>. He comes from a Christian upbringing and claims he  became "a pseudo-salafi wahhabi" after having been given da'wah by infiltrators of Jama'at at-Tabligh! That ought to tell you a lot about how much he really understood about the way of the Salaf of first three centuries! We'll leave it at that. Notice that most of these Kalamists (Naruiji, Keller, Yusuf) all come from Christian backgrounds which helps explain their gravitation towards the philosophy, kalam and gnostic illumnism with which al-Razi (d. 606), <a href='tags/al-shahrastani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/shahrastani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shahrastani</font></a></font></a> (d. 548H), <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), and al-Aamidee (d. 631H) polluted the din of the early Kullabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background Information</font>    <P>
First we need to provide the bigger picture, even if briefly. And that is what your <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> pretender is scared of and is never willing to enter into a discusssion regarding it.     <P>
<b><u>POINT 1: The Imaams [Forerunners] of the Ahl al-Kalam Are the Remnants  of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> to Whom Ibrahim (alayhis salaam) Was Sent</u></b>    <P>
Those to whom Ibrahim (alayhis salaam) was sent were the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, worshippers of stars, and they were of types. From them were those who were strayed from the remants of the teachings of the Books and Prophets, and they believed the universe was eternal. Others amongst them believed that the universe was originated, but because they did not affirm the notions of Prophethood, they demonstrated that the universe was originated through observation and analogy in the natural world. These are the people who used the proof using ajsaam (bodies) and their <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and they were also well-versed in Greek philosophy by that time. These people had a stronghold in <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a>, and they were known as the Harranian <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. Both Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi establish that the proof of ajsaam  and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> came from the non-Muslim <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. The ilm al-kalam condemned by the Salaf was this particular ilm al-kalam, and not the genus of kalam.    <P>
<b><u>POINT 2: Al-Ja'd and al-Jahm Brought the Way of the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> into the Ummah</u></b>    <P>
Al-Ja'd bin Dirham who mixed with these <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> brought this into the Ummah and al-Jahm took it from him, and as a result of this corrupt proof they used to demonstrate the universe is originated they were forced to deny names, attributes, and actions from Allah in order to remain consistent with their proof. They were the first to say the statement "Allah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)." There were certain core issues that were the largest obstacles to them and so their speech revolved around them. From them were that Allah did not speak and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. From them is that Allah is not above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. From them is that Allah did not take Ibraaheem as His friend. From them is that Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter. All of these, according to the proof, are qualities and incidental attributes of bodies which would mean that Allah Himself is originated. So because they made their corrupt proof to be the ultimate truth, they had to butcher and distort the revealed texts. This was the real reason for the innovation of ta'til and ta'wil (and later tafwid). The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> pushed this innovation for around a hundred years before Imam Ahmad subdued them between 225-232H. In this period there are countless statements from the Salaf regarding Allah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. Most of the ta'wils that have come down to the ummah have come from these <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/bishr-al-mareesi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bishr al-Mareesi</font></a> (d. 218H) in particular.    <P>
<b><u>Point 3: The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and Early Ash'ariyyah</u></b>    <P>
Then came <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> (d. 240H) and he was upon the way of 'ilm al-kalam, and he debated the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but succumbed to their doubts regarding hawaadith and Allah's chosen actions tied to His will and power (pleasure, anger, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> etc.). However <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> did not consider this proof of ajsaam and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> to be the ultimate truth, just a way of many used to prove the universe is originated. For this reason, he did not see the affirmation of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah (face, hands, eyes etc.) to clash witht his proof. It was the same with <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (d. 324H), and he actually considered the proof of ajsaam and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (called huduth al-ajsaam) to be an innovation. Hence, it is established that they affirmed Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and affirmed hands, face and eyes for Allah without ta'wil (tafwid had not been innovated yet). In these matters they refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. This became characteristic of the belief of the early Kullabi Ash'aris and this is firmly established from them and cannot be denied.  Then came <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 404H) and he opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and in his book al-Tamhid he elaborated upon the proof and he made it obligatory and treated it as the only way to established belief in a creator. In doing this, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, effectively laid down the road that would lead the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school to eventually retreat to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. However, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> himself, also affirmed Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His essence and affirmed the Sifat Khabariyyah, and he is unique in this regard from those who hold on to the obligation of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam.    <P>
<b><u>Point 4: The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and the Kullabiyyah Ash'ariyyah</u></b>    <P>
Another ilm al-kalam faction called the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, they were <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and they were also upon the proof of huduth al-ajsam, except that they were led to different conclusions. They reasoned that since all existence is only <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (substance, body) and incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), then Allah can only be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), and it is only in a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> that attributes can be established. You see the worst of the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were actually Ahl al-Kalam (this includes the Shi'ite groups too like the Hishaamiyyah). The extreme tajsim todays <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> like to refute, they don't tell you that these extremist <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> were all Ahl al-Kalam. The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> refuted the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, and in particular on the issue of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>. The <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, agreeing with the Salaf and with the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> affirmed Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but because of their <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> they exaggerated and said, Allah is a body and He is in contact (mumaass) with <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. So it became from the way of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> to say Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> without mumaassah (touch, contact) and without definition (tahdid) and the likes. And these statements of theirs are well known and documented and are found on this site.    <P>
<b><u>Point 5: The Later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> Take the Road towards Tajahhum and I'tizal</u></b>    <P>
Al-Baghdadi (d. 429) took the approach of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding al-'uluww and the sifat khabariyyah, <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (d. 458H) affirmed the sifat khabariyyah without ta'wil and tafwid but explained away al-'uluww. Al-Qushayri (d. 465) brought in the extreme tasawwuf and Sufism. Al-Juwayni (d. 472) completed the merger with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> denying 'uluww and the sifat khabariyyah and whilst he initially spoke with ta'wil, he later repudiated it and innovated the saying of tafwid and tried to ascribe it to the Salaf. From this point onwards, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and al-Razi (d. 606) hybridized the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> school with philosophy and illuminist gnosticism, and then al-Aamidee (d. 631) consildated that for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> thereafter. So what we are left with is a pollution of the Kullabi original, which <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was upon when he left I'tizal. This is what all <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon today and they are in fact disputants to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the very early Kullabi Ash'aris. They are in fact on the same side of the fence as the  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in many issues.    <P>
So these are historical facts and realities and the intent here is just to be precise, as for documentation of these matters, it is found in many other articles on this site.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Strategies of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Fraudsters and Pretenders to Knowledge Like Abu Layth bin 'Ataa</font>    <P>
Once the above is clear and the context has been set, we are in a position to understanding the conniving and treachery of people like Abu Layth towards historical fact. What they like to do is <b>to discuss matters completely divorced from studies of history</b>. Also they <b>to move the audience from macro-picture to micro-detail</b> or to <b>conceal the macro-picture and focus on the micro-detail</b>. Now, a great deal can be written on these two, but we want to keep it brief and concise.     <P>
To illustrate what we mean consider this:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Regarding concealing <b>the macro-picture</b>, it is not denied by anyone the fact that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> began to say Allah is everywhere. The <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> pretender Abu Layth will not and cannot deny that. Now, either the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> meant Allaah <u>in His essence</u> is everywhere, or they meant that Allaah, <u>metaphorically</u>, is everywhere. Which of the two they meant is very clear in the speech of the entirety of the Salaf and the early Kullabi Ash'aris. Further, when the Salaf said, "<i>Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the heaven</i>" in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, either they meant Allaah with His essence is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> only metaphorically speaking. The question therefore arises: <b>1)</b> were the Salaf <u>refuting the metaphor</u> of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that Allah is in every place (only figuratively) <u>with yet another metaphor</u> that Allah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (only figuratively)?! Or <b>2)</b> Were they refuting the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that Allah is in every place (with His essence) with their metaphorical, figurative saying that Allah is above His creation (in ranks and status only)?! Or <b>3)</b> Were they refuting the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in relation to Allah's essence? This a a question that <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> intelletual fraudsters and deceivers like Abu Layth bin 'Ataa must answer with respect to such historical fact that is so well documented it is impossible for any to deny it, or refuse to discuss, except one whose heart is accustomed to batil (falsehood) and love of it. So if they answer that the battle between the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> was one of metaphors, <b>then all people of sound intellect, the men, the women, youth, children, [even the birds and the bees, the fish in the oceans, and the wild game] will laugh at them, spit on them and throw rotten tomatoes at them, and push them on the sidewalk for uttering such nonsense, let alone believing it in the first place</b>.     <P>
So this is a refutation  [through historical fact] of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> fraudsters like Abu Layth, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> and other Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who don't have the courage and manliness to venture into objective study of the history of the first 300H years hijrah - because they know it is a hostile era and environment for them. Instead they want press your nose against the wall in the jarh and ta'deel of a narrator pertaining to a single narration in which they saw they could scavenge a free meal.</div>    <P>
So it is not possible to discuss the issue of Allah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, except with an honest discussion of historical fact and reality. And we see in the books of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and Harith al-Muhasibi, powerful refutations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in this regard, and likewise, in the books of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, refutations which establish Allah Himself, with His essence is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, alongside a refutation of both the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Mu'attilah (Allaah is in every place) and the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (Allah is a body in contact with the Throne).     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>As for focusing on <b>the micro-detail</b>, then what intelletual fraudsters and pretenders to knowledge like Abu Layth like to do is that when they see a few hundred statements recorded from the Salaf affirming Allah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, which cannot be disputed either from the angle of authenticity (thubut) or from the angle of their indication (dalaalah) - and that's what is besides the clear verses of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and the many ahaadeeth which are explicit in this regard - just like a bully coward in the school playground, they look for easy game, or they look in places where they can scavenge a free meal. So when they find that they can make a meal out of something, they will start writing about it, and blogging about it, and flex their muscles regarding it, and show their so-called erudition and profound knowledge regarding the matter. And this is what this fraudster tried to do with the statement of Imaam Maalik (rahimahullah) that "<i>Allaah is above the heaven and His knowledge is in every place</i>." </div>    <P>
So when this fraudster saw the meal, the easy game, in the form of what has been said about <b>Abdullah bin Nafi'</b> in terms of jarh and ta'dil by the Scholars of hadeeth, he embarked upon his fake display of profundity in 'ilm al-hadith and 'ilm al-rijaal. This is what we mean by shifting the attention of the audience from macro-picture to micro-detail, or concealing the macro-picture and pushing micro-details in the faces of people with a view to deceiving them.     <P>
This what al-Dhahabi mentions in al-Siyar in summarization of what has been said about the Abdullaah bin Nafi':    <P>

Imam Ahmad says that he knew the opinions of Malik and would give fatwa to the people of Madinah but was not a person of hadith. [Note: There is a difference between the narration of hadith of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) and between narrating the opinions of ones close teacher]. Yahya bin Ma'in declard him thiqah. Al-Bukhari said of him that some things are taken from him and others rejected. Abu Hatim said he is layyin (deficient) in his narrating from memory but sounder in what narrates through writing. Al-Nasaa'ee said there is no harm in him. And Ibn Adee said he narration strange things from Malik. And Ibn Sa'd said his companionship with Malik was extremely severe (meaning he was extremely tightly associted with Malik).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In short, he accompanied Malik very tightly, knew Maliks opinions very well, he was sound in terms of writing but when he narrated from memory, he was prone to error, because doubt (in what he memorized) afflicted him at the end of his life, and he was criticised for this, to varying degrees, by the hadith scholars.</div>    <P>
When you put all of that together, then narrating from Malik that Allah is "fis-samaa" - which is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and was a matter of ijma' upon the tongues of other Imams of the era and was clear distinguishing mark between the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the saying of Ahl al-Sunnah - is not the same as memorization and transmission of ahaadeeth from memory with precision. Abdullah bin Nafi' was spoken of in that regard, and so whatever hadiths he narrated from memory have weakness. And the matter of Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and Allah being "fis-samaa" is not from the gharaa'ib! And upon this, his narrating this statement of Malik on the subject of Allah being above the heaven, which was known to be the unanimous saying of all of the Imams of the Salaf, and al-Awzaa'ee (d. 157H) reports ijmaa (consensus) on it, then Abdullah bin Nafi's narrating of this from Imam Malik is acceptable in the view of the Scholars. And for argument's sake,  if it is weak, then so what? What difference does that make to the hundreds of other statements available and the scores of books on aqidah written before 300H from the Imaams of the Salaf which establish this without any dispute? The actual issue here is why have you made a meal out of this, when there are narrations from the Imaamas of the Salaf in books like Imam al-Bukhari's <i>Khalq Af'aal al-Ibaad</i> you can try to bang your head against? Forget that even, what about the saying of Allah, "Do you feel secure that He who is above the heaven (Fis-Samaa)" which occurs twice in Surah Mulk, and which contains the very phrase in wording and meaning? So there is not doubt all of this is just a fake display of knowledge, it is knowledge being used out of place with a view to deceive and to confound the unsuspecting.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary and Conclusion</font>    <P>
Abu Layth bin 'Ataa is a pretender to knowledge and is just another in a line of resentful <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who are in truth disputants to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, let alone the entirety of the Salaf, and in this respect they go hunting for easy game in terms of narrations in which there is some speech, and by which they can stupefy the onlookers and make a pretence of being mountains, alongside the profuse arrogance and bigotry. Then they make a huge five course meal out of it, a banquet, the whole works, and the onlookers are stupefied. Further, they make it appear as if the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah is dependent upon only one, two, or three narrations and that's it, and they make it look as if Ahl al-Sunnah are surviving on bread and water, when the reality is otherwise, in  fact, the other way around. However, to those with insight, these people like Abu Layth are but hyenas chewing on the rotten leftovers of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of old, who wished to obliterate the belief of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His essence, from the hearts of the people because it conflicts with their proof based on ajsaam (bodies) and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) which they took from the star-worshipping <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> through al-Ja'd bin Dirham, <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a>, Amr bin Ubayd, Bishr al-Marisi and their likes from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
