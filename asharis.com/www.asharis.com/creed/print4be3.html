<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
We have established in numerous articles previously that the early Kullabi Ash'aris affirmed the sifat khabariyyah (face, hands, eyes) in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who charged them and the Righteous Salaf of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and tashbih. This was rebutted by the Salaf who said that there is absolutely no tashbih in affirming whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself, and that tashbih is to liken <u>the realities</u> of Allah's attributes to the realities of those of the creation. Likewise, the likes of <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> all rebutted the ta'wils of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. Refer to these articles:     <div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> on the Sifat Khabariyyah (<a href=indexbd8e.html?ezymy>see here</a> and <a href=indexc1db.html?djmma>also here</a>).  <li> <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (see <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>this article</a> and <a href=indexdac3.html?tlyai>this article</a>).  <li> Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (see <a href=index0a89.html?cljbd>this article</a> and <a href=indexb9e5.html?xyodn>this one</a>).  </ul></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Confirmation from the <a href="tags/later-asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Later Ash'aris</font></a></font>    <P>
The following quotes have been used in other articles on this site in the course of addressing separate issues, and for the sake of ease of reference and future reference, we are reproducing them here. These quotes contain a confirmation from the later ones that the earlier Ash'aris did indeed affirm the attributes of face, hands, eyes for Allah, without tashbih, takyif, <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a>, ta'til and tafwid, following the way of the Salaf.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The claim that the Salaf or these Kullabi Ash'aris were upon tafwid in this matter is known to be spurious through the fact that they rebutted the ta'wils of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and also denied the charge of tajsim and tashbih. These rebuttals from them simply cannot have been on the basis that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were challenging the "texts" alone as opposed to the meanings the texts indicate. They were not saying, "We deny the text that mentions Allah's hand", rather they were saying, "We deny the text indicates the attribute of hand." This proves that the contention was one of meaning, proving the Salaf and the Kullabi Ash'aris affirmed the meanings, and their denial was in relation to having knowledge of the kaifiyyah. This is very apparent from reading the articles listed above. However, todays <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are confused in that they are unable to distinguish between the meaning of "hand" and the reality of the hands of the creation, despite the fact that they are able to affirm the meanings of "life, will, power, hearing, seeing" and separate them from the realities  of these attributes in created beings. As it is impossible for these attributes to exist in the creation without bodies, limbs and the likes, this is a clear contradiction, and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> do not have any sound principle with which to distinguish between these attributes and those attributes. You can see what happened to their attempts in this regarding <a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>in this article</a>! Bear in mind that this argument we just mentioned is the very one that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> used against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> when they <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> accused them of being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> for affirming the attributes of hands. They said, we do not see in observable existence anything with life, power, will except that it is a body. This shows that the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> indeed followed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the subject of the sifat khabariyyah, and it proves without a doubt that the likes of <a href='tags/nuh-keller.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuh Keller</font></a>, Sa'id Foudah, Hamza Yusuf, <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a>, the <a href='tags/marifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Marifah</font></a> blind-followers, and other paupers (faqirs) are committing academic, historical and intellectual fraud, and misleading many sincere people.</div>    <P>
So here are the quotes, first from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who cites this as the view of all of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Hadith, in al-Maqaalaat (tahqiq Muhammad Muhyi al-Din, Egypt, 1950):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ashari-maqalat-sifat-khabar.gif  border=0>    <P>
In the above passage al-Ash'aris says about the Ahl al-Hadith wal-Athar that they affirm a face for Allaah, two hands and two eyes, bilaa kayf (without a how), and this is <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) with negation of takyif.    <P>
Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi said in his book Usul al-Din (p.111-112):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baghdadi-yadaan.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And some of our associates claimed that two hands (yad&#257;n) are two attributes for All&#257;h, the Sublime and Exalted, and al-Qal&#257;nis&#299; said they are one attribute and some of our associates made <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> of them to mean qudrah (power) ... and this is correct in the madhhab ... and some of our associates claimed that His two hands are two attributes and al-Qal&#257;nis&#299; claimed that they are just one attribute.</blockquote>    <P>
Note how al-Baghdadi (d. 429H) made a sharp departure from the belief of the earlier Ash'aris and united with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this issue. And note also that <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> did not agree with his Shaykh (al-Baghdadi) and affirmed two hands as attributes of the essence without <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid.    <P>
And then we have <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a> (d. 478H) stating in al-Irshad (p. 155):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/juwayni-face-hands-eyes.gif  border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Chapter: Two hands, two eyes and face. Some of our leading scholars (a'immah) have gone to the view that the two hands, <b>two eyes</b> and face are established attributes for the Lord, the Exalted, and that the path to affirming them is the revealed texts, without entering the realm of reason (&#703;aql).</blockquote>    <P>
Sayf al-Din al-Aamidee (d. 631H) wrote in his book Ghayat al-Maraam (p. 135)    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1589;&#1581;&#1575;&#1576; &#1605;&#1606; &#1586;&#1575;&#1583; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1608;&#1571;&#1579;&#1576;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605; &#1576;&#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1583; &#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578; &#1586;&#1575;&#1574;&#1583;&#1577; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1575; &#1571;&#1579;&#1576;&#1578;&#1606;&#1575;&#1607; &#1608;&#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1605;&#1579;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1602;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1580;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606;&#1610;&#1606; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606; </div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from the associates (of the madhhab)  are those who added to this, and affirmed knowledge of the existence of attributes additional to what we have mentioned, and this  is the likes of al-baq&#257;' (lasting, remaining), wajh (face), <b>&#703;ayn&#257;n (two eyes)</b>, yad&#257;n (two hands).</blockquote>    <P>
From all of these quotes it is clear that today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are hypocrites (in action) of the worst kind, and they are in reality with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this matter, and they fail to distinguish between:    <P>
<ul><li> The <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> from Ahl al-Kalam, like the Raafidi Hishamiyyah and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, who are in reality their brethren in ilm al-kalam, who affirmed Allaah to be a human with limbs and the likes, and they arrived at these views through the language and terminology of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad common to all the Mutakallimin, this group likened Allah's essence (dhat) to the essences of the creation, a consequence of which was that they also made likeness between Allaah's attributes and those of the creation.    <P>
<li> Those who exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) and said, "hand like my hand, face like my face, and hearing like my hearing and seeing like my seeing", this group likened Allah's attributes with those of the creation.    <P>
<li> Ahl al-Sunnah, and the early Kullabis who made ithbat of the text and its indication of the attribute in its meaning, but denied any likeness in its reality with the creation, except that the way of the Salaf is to make <u>general negation</u> and say "we affirm hand, face, hearing, seeing, will, power without takyif and tashbih" and the way of those early Kullabi Ash'aris was to make <u>specific, detailed negation</u> such as their saying "we affirm hands which are not limbs and eyes which are not pupils" and so on. This opposes the manhaj of the Salaf in the corroboration of their belief, even if the meaning is nevertheless correct. And the way of the Salaf was to strictly adhere to the Book and the Sunnah in both <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) and nafi (negation). <u>But both groups affirm the meaning (ma'naa) and negate the kaifiyyah</u>, one (the Salaf) negate in a general way, and the other (the Kullabi Ash'aris) negate in a specific detailed way. And this is entirely different to the way of the Ash'aris be that <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> or tafwid.</ul>    <P>
Through this, the academic and intellectual fraud of today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and their slanders and lies against Ahl al-Sunnah and the early Kullabi Ash'aris are made apparent. And when they make this accusation of tajsim, they are in reality, making it also against <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-mahdi-al-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and others.    <P>
