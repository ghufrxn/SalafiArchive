<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The True Roots and Origins of What Became the View of the Saying of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>What is contained in this statement of <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H) is also found in the words of <b>Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee</b> (d. 258H), the Shaykh of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, a century before <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a>. <a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>See this article here</a> where his words are quoted and translated.</div>    <P>
Ibn Battah (d. 387H) said regarding the emergence of what became the view of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> from its Jahmee roots, in his "Ibaanat ul-Kubraa" in the book "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" (1/317-318):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-battah-quran-created-lafdhiyyah.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: Mention of the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> and Warning From their Opinion and Their Sayings</b>    <P>
Know, may Allaah have mercy upon you that a faction amongst the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, out of the conniving of their hearts, and the vileness of their opinions and the repugnance of their desires believed that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And they alluded to that with an innovation they invented out of deception and misleading of the common folk, [all] in order to conceal their kufr, seeking to obscure their deviation from the one whose knowledge was little and whose disposition was weak. So they said:     <P>
<blockquote>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah spoke with and said, that is the speech of Allaah, not created, and as for that which we recite and read with our tongues and which we write in our copies [of the Qur'an] is not the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah. This is only a hikaayah (quotation, narrative) of that. <u>So what we read is a hikaayah (quotation, narrative) of that <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with our own words (alfaadh), and our verbal expression (with our words) is created</u>.</blockquote>    <P>
So they became subtle in their kufr and they used deceitful means in order to enter kufr upon the common folk with the most obscure way, and the most minute [in detail] of madhhab, and the most hidden aspect.    <P>
But that was not hidden, by the praise of Allaah, and His favour, and the goodness of his tawfeeq (granting of success) upon the great Scholars, the intelligent critics, until they [the Scholars] rejected as false what they [the Jahmites] fabricated and they unveiled the cover from the repugnance of what they concealed.    <P>
So their kufr and deviance became apparent to both the distinguished and the common folk. And the one who who was wise to that and knew where the repugnance lay in  [the saying of the Jahmites] was the Shaykh, the Saalih (righteous), and the Imaam, the Scholar, the intelligent one, Abu Abdullaah Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal - may Allaah have mercy upon him. And the clarification of their kufr was manifest and clear in the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).</blockquote>    <P>
And this viewpoint of this faction of <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, as we can see, is one which the saying of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> derives from - save that the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> called what they said was the uncreated Qur'aan to be the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (the "meaning" that resides with the self of Allaah from eternity), whereas these <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> did not speak with that, and nor did these <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> deny that Allaah spoke in reality (with letter and voice) - they simply incorporated their belief that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in our presence, in letter and word, is created within the statement "My recitation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created".     <P>
The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said that the Qur'aan that we have in our possession, whose words we recite, memorize and hear, that it is created, and it is a "hikaayah" (quotation, narrative) and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> said it is an "ibaarah" (expression) - and they don't affirm for Allah the "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" which is correctly and properly defined in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs as the combination of the "ma'naa" (meaning) and the "lafdh" (wording, expression) together. Rather, they say Allaah's "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is only the "meaning" - and this bid'ah was unknown until <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> originated it and Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> followed him in, as has been mentioned by the likes of <u>Abdul Kareem ash-Shahrastani (d. 548H)</u>, himself an Ash'ari, who said in Nihaayat ul-Aqdaam (p. 177), whilst noting that ash-Shahrastani's statements in characterizing the views of the Salaf are not entirely accurate and precise, but there is enough in what he has said that approximates to what is correct:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> <u>innovated a third saying</u> and judged with the emergence of the letters, and this is the destruction of the ijmaa' (concensus) and he judged that what we read is Allaah's speech <u>only metaphorically (majaazan)</u> not in reality (haqeeqatan) - <u>and this is pure innovation</u>. Why did he not (simply) say that the revelation mentions that what we read and write is the Speech of Allaah without (him) delving into its kaifiyyah (how it is) and its haqeeqah (its reality) - just like in the revelation many attributes have been mentioned such as Face, Two Hands and other than them from the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Khabariyyah.</blockquote>    <P>
Here he is saying that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> broke the Ijmaa' and innovated a third saying, which is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is said to be Allaah's speech only "metaphorically", since their view was that Allaah's real <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", and not the letters and words that make up the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and that Allaah does not speak with letter and voice. Ash-Shahrastani is in error here because it was <u>Ibn Kullaab and the Kullaabiyyah</u> who originated this view and not <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> himself.     <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And as this is known with Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Hadeeth, then it is also the saying of all of the sects of the Ummah, for the majority of all of the various factions say: "Allaah speaks with a voice" alongside their dispute(s) regarding whether His speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is created (or not)? And is it established with His Self (or not)? And whether it is eternal (qadeem) or recent (haadith)? And whether He has never ceased being "one who speaks when He wills" (or not)?    <P>
For this (that Allaah speaks with a voice) is the saying of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, Shee'ah, most of the Murji'ah, Saalimiyyah, and other than them from the Hanafiyyah, Maalikiyyah, Shaafi'iyyah, Hanbaliyyah and Soofiyyah.    <P>
And there is not from the factions of the Muslims anyone who rejected that Allaah speaks with a voice (sawt) except <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and whoever followed him.</blockquote>    <P>
And it is for this reason that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> condemned the likes of al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee and Hussain al-Karaabeesee because they started speaking with the speech of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> on this issue.    <P>
<b>But returning to the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (and that of Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee - <a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>see here</a>) it is clear and apparent that the roots of the Ash'arite position are found in this faction of people whom the Salaf described with disbelief, deception, treachery, plotting, conniving, repugnance, vileness and the likes.</b>    <P>
<u>So all praise is due to Allaah</u> who made the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah to be based upon the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah, and the Ijmaa' of the Righteous Salaf which is that Allaah has always been "one who speaks" (mutakallim), with speech being an attribute of the essence, just like ilm (knowledge) hayaat (life), sam' (hearing) and basr (seeing), and that Allaah also speaks as and when He wills, however He wills, His speech being tied to His will (mashee'ah) and power (qudrah). And alongside all of that, His speech is not created, and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Allaah's speech, He spoke it, and it is uncreated, and that there is only one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (not two Qur'ans), and whether it is recited, heard, memorized or written, it is, in letter and word, the uncreated, spoken word of Allaah.    <P>
<u>And all praise is due to Allaah</u> who made the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (of two Qur'ans - <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>see here</a>)  to be based upon the sayings of the lowly, vile, despicable, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of old, the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who were not seen in the eyes of the Righteous Salaf except as conniving plotters, repugnant, treacherous, deceiving, surmising liars, utterers of kufr - who after being subdued by the likes of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in their saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created - came with their saying of "lafdh" (my recitation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created) with a view to arrive at their saying that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have present with us, written, heard, memorized, recited, in letter and word, is created and that there are two Qur'ans, one that was not revealed, and one that was revealed, which is the created Qur'an!    <P>
And it is for this very reason that you will see the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of today and the fake <a href='tags/pseudo-hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Pseudo-Hanbalis</font></a> (Sufi Ash'aris posing as Hanbalis) saying:    <P>
<blockquote>Hey just say "<i>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Allaah's Speech, not created</i>" but don't go any deeper than that, as there is no benefit in delving these issues and it just causes splits.</blockquote>    <P>
And this is from the makr (conniving) of their hearts, and their attempt to conceal a saying that amounts to kufr which is that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, is created. They know full well that their creed is derived from the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> doctrine of al-lafdh, with the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> being those who developed this doctrine into the doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" - so beware of these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> for their deception knows no limits! <P>
