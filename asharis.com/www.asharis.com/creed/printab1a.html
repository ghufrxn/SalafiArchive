<p>All praise is due to Allaah and may the prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/top-tips.gif align=left border=0> We are pleased to announce a new and much needed section entitled "<b>Top Tips To Become a Better Ash'ari</b>". Unfortunately, we are <u>not very impressed or pleased</u> with the level of ignorance found amongst the vast majority of Ash'aris. You will agree no doubt, this needs to be remedied. For this reason, "<b><a href='tags/top-tips.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>top tips</font></a></b>" will provide the background knowledge and understanding to give those Ash'aris who are lagging behind a bit of sense, purpose, direction and impetus.     <P>
This series should be followed along with our  "<u><a href='tags/competition-corner.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Competition Corner</font></a></u>" series (<a href=series/ashari-competition-and-quiz-corner---test-your-ashariyyah.html>see here</a>), as they are in fact both complementary to each other. No matter what your level, a beginner, or a promising Kalam Atomist, these tips will still help you. You should also remember, there are lots of those 'evil wahhabis' on the one hand and 'crazy atheist philosophers' on the other that need to be kept at bay. There's no point looking brave and serious <u>when your pockets are empty</u>.    <P>
So here goes, this is our second tip - and our tips by the way are in no particular order, they are random and miscellaneous:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The 2nd Tip: Get That <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> Under Your Belt</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/top-tips-2.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Tip Tafseer</font>    <P>
<b><u>Point 1:</u> <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> is the Basis of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</b>    <P>
The very first thing that you should be aware of in this tip is that there was in the Muslim lands, when Islam spread, the presence of atheist and materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who were very conversant with the philosophy of the Greeks, especially that of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and his metaphysical classifications. So when it came to arguing with these atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, then any proof devised against them would have to be with language and terminology they were familiar with and would readily accept. Hence, the original proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" devised by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H) made use of some of these basic notions which the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of that time were familiar with. Aristotle's "Categories" laid the foundations of this knowledge, and in Arabic they became known as "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar" - The Ten Categories. The <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> was preceded by Aristotle's <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>, and generally this knowledge was concerned with "bodies" (ajsaam, jawaahir) and their "incidental attributes" (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>), or more formally "accidents".    <P>
<b><u>Point 2:</u> Aristotle's Ten Categories</b>    <P>
Here are Aristotle's ten categories, the first deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol>    <P>
<b><u>Point 3:</u> Be Thankful</b>    <P>
Remember, always give credit where credit is due. <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> laid down the foundations for the "magnifying glass" (i.e. the  categories) that helps to identify <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (something being a body, a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, or jawhar), no matter how subtle it is, <u>and</u> he laid down the foundational <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> from which "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" could be formulated from - so "Thank you Aristotle" - and how else could the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> have clarified and explained Tawheed and rebutted the apparent kufr and shirk they saw in the revealed texts without the likes of this knowledge!    <P>
<b><u>Point 4:</u> Identifying <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>, Go For It Holmes!</b>    <P>
My dear Ash'ari friend. You are not worth your salt if you haven't mastered Aristotle's categories and his <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. Sorry to be blunt, but without getting this under your belt, you will never understand the bulk of what your creed is based upon in reality. Once you have done that, you will understand the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" more fully and be able to demonstrate it to any Atheist. But remember, if the Atheist comes back and says, "Describe your Lord", <u>then you've got to be prepared for that</u>. So you must be ready to go hunting for "<a href="tags/jismiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jismiyyah</font></a>" in the revealed texts to protect your intellectual proof from invalidation. Once you've truly mastered this knowledge which originated with the Greek Ancients and was passed through the pseudo-Sabian Star-Worshipping <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of Harraan, trust me, you'll be seeing <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> left, right and center, in all places in the revealed texts, and you will know how to deal with these problematic texts that clash with the proof. No Atheist will be able to point out the flaw in your intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" once you learn how to deal with those revealed texts.    <P>
<b><u>Point 5:</u> Find <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>, Point, Shoot With a <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and Move On...</b>    <P>
We are now ready to illustrate ... so let's see what we can find in the revealed texts ...    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> ar-Rahmaan ascended (<a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>) above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (Taha 20:5) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Hey, that's <u>al-ayn (place)</u> and <u>al-idaafah (relative position)</u> - and those are properties of <u>ajsaam (bodies)</u> - this is <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> - and this opposes our proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". Pull out the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> gun, load it with a <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> (bullet) of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a>, or Bishr al-Mareesee or any of the Jahmee, Mu'tazilee brands, 'zap', and you've got your end result. You've abolished that apparent kufr and shirk which necessitates Allaah is a body (thanks <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, pseudo-Sabeans, Jahm, and al-Ja'd for helping us to understand the true Tawheed which the Messengers did not know of, or they were not able to express, or they knew it but deliberately never expressed it) and depending upon what bullet you used you've ended up with:    <P>
<ul><li>ar-Rahman conquered the Throne  <li>It's <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> that made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> in actuality  <li>The <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> is simply Allaah's dominion and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> is an act that takes place therein  </ul>    <P>
And thus those 'evil wahabis', on the one hand, and those 'nasty, evil' <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> are kept in check - all with a single 'zap' - this is powerful stuff.    <P>
And look what we've found here:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And Allaah spoke to Moses (wa kallamAllaahu Moosaa), direct (Nisaa 4:164) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Hey, that's an <u>action</u> (what an entity is doing), its a temporal characteristic (an instance of speech that takes place and ends) which is an event (haadithah), and it also includes <u>quality</u> (al-kayf) because speech necessitates sound - something perceived with the senses, thus necessitating a "howness" - and all of this is pure <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> - kufr and shirk. We know the routine now. Load, point, 'zap' and we can now have:    <P>
<ul><li>Allaah created speech in the tree and the tree spoke  <li> Allaah spoke to Moses with his "eternal Kalaam" that resides within His Self  <li>Allaah inspired the meaning into the heart of Moses</ul>    <P>
And if the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> gun is not effective, just utilize a bit of tahreef instead and that way we can have:    <P>
<ul><li>"<b>And Moses spoke to Allaah (wa kallamAllaaha Moosaa), direct</b>" so its Moosaa who actually spoke and not Allaah</ul>    <P>
And thus those 'evil wahabi mujassims', on the one hand, and those 'nasty, evil' atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> are kept in check, once again and we've dealt with them with a single stone.    <P>
<b><u>Point 6:</u> Don't Waste Those Bullets, Be Wise</b>    <P>
In the later times (after six or seven centuries) the situation became such that the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in particular had political strength and their creed was spread in many lands, in North Africa and in Shaam. This is similar to how the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had gained an upper hand around the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>.     <P>
Within this climate (in the later centuries) there arose many good Scholars who were brought up and who learned knowledge, and they considered much of what they learned about the creed to be the truth, as that was what was predominant. Examples include <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a>, and <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>. These scholars were not upon the usool (foundations) of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, rather they rejected many of them - and that is because Allaah had favoured them with good knowledge and understanding and they believed in these usool. However, they were affected in certain areas in creed and thus they spoke with something of the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the Ash'aris, believing it to be the truth. Now, as an prudent Ash'ari, it's important you don't waste those <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> bullets. It's simpler and easier that you just make good use of the statements of the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a>, <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and others because they can be an effective means in promoting the cause.     <P>
<u>But just don't venture too close to the third century and before, because that's very a dangerous time and territory</u>.    <P>
Keep safe by keeping away from that zone, it won't be very friendly for you and some poor guys were getting executed, others imprisoned, and others beaten with sandals for indulging in this "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" and making "<a href="tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" of the texts. So the rule is "Know your territory, play safe, and remain safe".    <P>
If you've got a choice of a few hundred statements from the early Salaf on the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, don't go there, flee from it - it's dangerous, unfriendly territory. Stick with quotes from the later times. One quote from the later times can be just as effective as a full round of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> bullets. So be wise and don't be wasteful in any way.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Serious Note to Non-Ash'aris Only</b>    <P>
Because the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", the demonstration of the createdness of the universe, made use of metaphysical language (such as <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, makan, tahayyuz and so on) - and because the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) used this proof and its associated language to argue for certain foundations of the religion such as:    <P>
<ul><li> A Creator  <li> Prophethood  <li>Resurrection</ul>    <P>
Then they were <u>forced</u> to make all their speech about divinity and belief in Allaah through <u>a collection of negations</u> centered around <u>these same terms</u>. They  had to do this <u>in order to avoid invalidating their proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</u> which they now considered to be <u>the ultimate truth</u> and upon which the veracity of the revealed texts, of creation, prophethood and resurrection depends. Thus, when you look in all the books of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (such as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah), that's all you are going to see. They made Tawheed to be "Jawhar and 'Arad" and what follows on from it whereas the Tawheed of the Messengers is "There is none worthy of worship except Allaah alone" and what follows on from it.    <P>
<b>Playing Tennis with the Philosophers</b>    <P>
A good parable for showing what happened is this: The atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> invited these people (the Mutakallimoon) to a tennis match. So the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> served first and these people agreed to play the game on the court of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, on their terms (i.e. their <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>, their terminologies and language). So these people thought it's an easy game and so they returned the ball - but they've been hitting the ball backward and forward ever since and never managed to escape the game because they were stuck with its associated <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>, with which they thought they could easily defeat those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. So that's where they've remained - stuck with that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>". And determined to win the game, they were forced to take a certain stance towards the revealed texts, and without taking that stance towards the revealed texts (ta'weel, tahreef), they would have had to withdraw from the game and admit defeat. And there was no way they were going to do that, there was too much at stake now, and so continue the game they did.</div>    <P>
