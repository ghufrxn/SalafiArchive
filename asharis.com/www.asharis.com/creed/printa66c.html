<p>All Praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, seek His aid and His Forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides there is none to misguide and whomsoever Allaah misguides there is none to guide. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, alone, without any partners and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. To proceed:    <P>

Many of today's <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari proponents attempt to hinder their followers from the truth by asserting that the only response from those who are upon the aqeedah of the Salaf to their "answers" is to accuse them of following Greek philosophy, logic and rationalism. This is despite the fact that all the major foundational Ash'ari books on creed contain foundations based upon the ideas and philosophical ramblings of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> (see <a href=indexe187.html?gmsin>here</a> and <a href=indexaa3c.html?haarl>here</a>).     <P>
However, in order not to alert the average (and uninformed) Ash'ari to the true sources and real origins of the theology of the Ash'arite <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (which all Ash'aris are upon today), they put up smokescreens to hinder others from the truth. This is often with their full knowledge that when an average Ash'ari goes further into their creed beyond the surface level - the falsehood starts to become readily apparent. To this end, much of their defense of the concocted creed they are upon (a mixture of the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> inherited from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, alongside their foundational principles, fused with the philosophical principles of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and Democritus) relies upon the very same philosophical ramblings they claim they are wrongly labeled with.     <P>
In addition to this, their wild exaggerations about the creed of the Salaf necessitating <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and their demonization (with falsehood) of those upon the pure Salafi creed is a standard instrument for legitimizing their theology that disdains the texts and glorifies the false necessities of their intellects.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> The <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (<a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>), amongst whom are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> - did not concur with the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> in their views and conclusions. Rather they took some underlying basic concepts and used them in their own theology and made conclusions from them, different to what the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> were upon. However, the basic notions, such as <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>), <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), and all the discussions and debates the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> had amongst themselves regarding the terms they employed - all of that has its basis in what they took from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>. Their differences amongst themselves in these issues lie in the definitions, applications and conclusions from the basic notions they are agreed upon.</div>    <P>
The above diagram is a representation of the origins, roots and sources of the "<u>philosophical jahmeespeak</u>" that we hear from today's <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>. And amongst their most vocal is one whose polemical speech is replete with such philosophical ramblings and principles despite his explicit denials of being influenced by it in creed.     <P>
So what follows will be a detailed explanation of what you see in the diagram and <b>we will establish it with solid proofs that leave no absolutely no doubt inshaa'Allaah</b> as to the origins of "<u><a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a></u>", and we shall illustrate, inshaa'Allaah, that these are not just empty phrases we are using to merely demonize the opponent without proof - rather these are meaningful phrases that relate to the proper identification of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari thought patterns and reasoning with their foundational roots.     <P>
This page will be regularly updated inshaa'Allaah, with the addition of points and the aim is to provide working knowledge and understanding of what is in the diagram. So please check back often ... and consider this a work in progress.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 1:</u> The Usool (Foundations) of The Methodology of Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar, the Salaf us-Saalih In Speaking About And Believing in Their Lord</font>    <P>
It is important that we establish the truth before we investigate the psychology and the mental processes behind contemporary "<a href="tags/jahmeespeak.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmeespeak</font></a>" - because that is the criterion by which everything besides it is judged. So being concise:    <P>
The foundation of the methodology in belief of Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar, the Salaf us-Salih, is founded upon three solid principles:    <P>
<ul>  <li> That Allaah is <u>the most knowledgeable</u> of His Own Self, and the Messenger (alayhis salaam) <u>the most knowledgeable</u> of the creation regarding Allaah    <P>
<li> That Allaah is <u>the most eloquent</u> in speaking about Himself and the Messenger (alayhis salaam) is <u>the most eloquent of the creation</u> in speaking about His Lord    <P>
<li> That Allaah's Messenger is <u>the most sincere</u> of all creation in intending guidance of the Ummah to the correct belief</ul>    <P>
Thus we affirm for Allaah perfect ilm (knowledge) regarding Himself and for His Messenger being the greatest in knowledge (a'lamu) of the creation regarding Allaah, as well as bayaan and fasaahah (clarification, discourse, eloquence and purity of language) in speech about Allaah, and giving the best nus.h (counsel, guidance). And it is absolutely and necessarily binding that anyone who does not adopt the methodology of the Salaf us Salih in this subject reviles Allaah and the Messenger either in <u>a) their knowledge</u> or <u>b) their eloquence in language and expression</u> or <u>c) their giving of nus.h</u> (counsel, guidance) - there is <u>absolutely and categorically</u> no escape from this - with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of every age and era knowing this full well.    <P>
Then after this we find in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah - (which both comprise perfect knowledge, the extremity of eloquence and purity of language, and the extremity of counsel and guidance) - the affirmation of Names and Attributes for Allaah, proven to be as such by the rules of language. And this occurs by:    <P>
<ul><li> Explicit mention of the Name, such as "ar-Rahmaan" which incorporates the attribute, in this case "rahmah"    <P>
<li> Explict mention of the attribute by its noun form, such as "ilm" (knowledge), "quwwah" (power), "izzah" (might), "wajh" (face) and so on.    <P>
<li> Through the mention of the attribute as it relates to the creation in verb form, such as when Allaah says, "Allaah <u>has heard</u> the statement of she who disputes ...", or "Indeed, I am with you both, <u>I hear and I see</u>" where the attribute is established through the judgement of a verb.</ul>    <P>
Once we have established these foundations, the methodology that is built upon them can be outlined - (namely that Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar, the Salaf us-Salih - with respect to <u>everything</u> ascribed to Allaah in the Book and the Sunnah as a Name or Attribute in the manner explained above):    <P>
<ul><li><u>Affirm whatever Allaah has affirmed for Himself or what His Messenger has affirmed for him - whilst holding the impossibility of there being any likeness to any of that from the creation</u> - by textual ruling of the Book of Allaah,  "<b>There is no likeness unto Him, and He is the all-Hearing, all-Seeing</b>" (42:11) and negating from such affirmations a) <u><a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a></u>, b) <u><a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a></u> c) <u><a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a></u> d) <u>tahreef</u>. So in affirmation, it is a middle path between two extremes. Nu'aym bin Hammaad (d. 228H) said: "<i>Whoever makes <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resemblance) of Allaah to his creation has committed kufr (disbelief), and whoever denies what Allaah has described Himself with has also committed kufr. Indeed, all that Allaah has described Himself with, or what His Messenger has described Him with, <u>then there is no <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in it at all</u></i>."     <P>
<li><u>Negate for Allaah whatever He negated for Himself and whatever His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) negated from Him</u> - and negating in the Book and the Sunnah, overwhelmingly, is done in a general sense, such as the statement, "There is nothing like unto Him..." and the negation of nidd (rival), kofu (equal), samiyy (namesake, similar equal).    <P>
<li><u>Adhering only to the words reported in the Book and the Sunnah in speaking about Allah</u> and where there are words that are not in the Book and the Sunnah, their intended meanings are investigated - and if a correct and true meaning that befits Allah is intended, the meaning is affirmed, but the wording is shunned and instead the language of the Book and the Sunnah is adopted, and where the intended meaning is false then the wording is rejected and Allaah is declared free from it.</ul>    <P>
This is only <u>a broad outline</u> of the methodology and is by no means a comprehensive or exhaustive treatment.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 2:</u> Distinguishing Between the Genuine, Just, Balanced Opponent and the Pretentious, Extremist, Unjust Opponent</font>    <P>
To illustrate what is meant by this, we refer you to an article in which <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> affirms what the Salaf were upon, and what is manifestly in the Book and the Sunnah, of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, separate and distinct from His creation. <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>See here for the article</a>. Please take a moment to read this article. We see that <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, being considered an Ash'ari, demonstrates the justice and fairness that is found amongst the notables. It is an insult to even begin comparing the likes of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> to today's species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari who stoops to unknown levels in fabricating and slandering his opponent with something that he is free of and does not speak with, and makes binding from his speech that which is not binding.    <P>
When they hear the people upon the creed of the Salaf say, "<i>Allaah is above His Throne</i>" speaking with the speech of Allaah and His Messenger, they (the contemporary Jahmites) turn it into the standard <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a> "<i>They believe in a body that floats in the sky</i>...". In contrast, and despite the fact that even though <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> takes the way of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and speaks about negation of al-jihah and al-makaan upon the way of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - he and those like him had the honesty to admit  that the Salaf indeed held Allaah to be above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, above His creation, separate and distinct from it - and he went as far as saying that the Salaf affirmed "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" (direction) for Allaah (<a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>see the article</a>) - even though we do not use such a word in affirmation of our aqeedah.    <P>
Hence, we distinguish between the honesty, uprightness and justice of the genuine opponent and the variety of lying, sinful, ignominious and pretentious contemporary forelocks that tarnish the name of <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> by falsely ascribing themselves to him, and likewise tarnish the very <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> such as <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> who affirmed Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with His Essence (<a href=index6fc6.html?kmtsq>see here</a>) and affirmed the Attributes of Face, Hands and Eyes (<a href=indexdac3.html?tlyai>see here</a>) and affirmed the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> such as <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (<a href=indexe032.html?xnggx>see here</a>) whilst negating <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and without resorting to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>  - and this despite inheriting the legacy of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and incorporating the philosophical principles of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> into their theology - they did not go as far as negating Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and the Attributes of His Essence.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 3:</u> An Illustration of <a href="tags/jahmeespeak.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmeespeak</font></a></font>    <P>
At this point we want to illustrate what we mean by <u><a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a></u>, and we will give an example of it here, and inshaa'Allaah we will come back to it later. This is also an example of an unjust, extreme, and shameless opponent who has no shame in fabricating lies and making the wildest of exaggerations - needed to give psychological comfort for the delusions of mind from which his theology springs ... so here is a good example of <u><a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a></u> - one that Jahm would have been highly proud of ... poor Jahm, the Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, overwhelmed him in argument and confused him and made him doubt in His Lord, and he spent forty days in abandonment of the prayer, confused and bewildered, not knowing who he was worshipping, until he was able to fabricate an answer with his own mind ... but this contemporary <u><a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a></u> - how Jahm would have rejoiced with it, and how proud of his legacy in the 21st century would he have been ...    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmi-answers-above-arsh-jism.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
We will return to this when we dissect the mental process and the psychology that underlies it - all of which has been inherited from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of the Harranian "<a href="tags/sabeans.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sabeans</font></a>", the concoctions of Jahm when faced with confusion in his debates with the Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the philosophy of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> ... whilst they claim that they are not influenced by the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> - a brazen fraud. So inshaa'Allaah we will return to this <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a> with the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far ar-Raazee (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see the opening section to this article</a>).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 4: </u>The Sabean Harrani <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font>    <P>
Now we want to lay the foundations to help us identify the spring and fountain of <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a>, so lets look at the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and their <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. There are some differences regarding the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and specifically to which faction or group this label is applied to, and the reason for that will be indicated in what follows.    <P>
The <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> date prior to the time of Ibraheem (alayhis salaam) and the foundation of their belief was in a supreme creator and they were upon Tawheed initially. However, the vast majority deviated away from that and became disbelievers and mushriks. And Allaah has mentioned the believers amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (al-Baqarah 2:62, al-Maa'idah 5:69 al-Hajj 22:17).     <P>
Those amongst them who fell into shirk, they held that just like the bodies of men are inhabited by souls, then the heavenly bodies and the spheres are inhabited by angelic souls or higher forms of intelligence. They held that these souls and intelligences had been assigned the role of governing Allaah's creation, and they held them to be pure and holy and they took them as intermediaries between themselves and Allaah, and they worshipped them and set up temples for their worship and indulged in idolatries. However, they still maintained a belief in the Creator - as is the case with all Mushriks.    <P>
There were <u>spiritual <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> amongst them</u>, who were under the influence of Greek and Aristotelian philosophy and they only described the Creator with attributes of negation (sifaat salbiyyah) or with relative attributes (sifaat idaafiyyah).      <P>
With the advent of Islam these people came under its rule and amongst them were a very small remnant of the original Hunafaa <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, with the  majority of them being the mushriks and disbelievers along with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in their midst.     <P>
<b><u>Regarding Harran</u> </b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Harran, a major trade route across what was then Mesopotamia (Turkey, Northern Syria), became a place where these people became settled and established - and this was prior to Islam. This <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a> became a center of intellectual activity and a philosophical tradition that had its roots in a mixture of pagan thought and neoplatonic and Greek philosophy. These pagans and disbelievers of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a> were the main source of the Greek philosophy which found its way amongst the Muslims.  They had a great interest in astrology, astronomy, mathematics and magic and played an instrumental role in translating much of the Greek works in astronomy, geometry and other sciences. <u>Harran became so famous for the Greek (Hellenistic) philosophy that it even earned the title "Hellenopolis"</u>.</div>    <P>
<b><u>Regarding the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of Harran</u></b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And it has been documented by <u>Ibn an-Nadim (d. 385H) in his Kitab ul-Fihrist</u> (translated into English by Bayard Dodge, 1969) that the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a> <u>were not really Sabeans</u> but that they later identified themselves as <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in the time of al-Ma'moon in order to avoid persecution or assimilation by the Muslims and as a result they were given favourable status. And other commentators have indicated that the real <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (which have been called the Mandaeans and who were closer to Islam) were elsewhere, and they were in southern Iraq.  Accepting this to be the case, these Harranians were upon a mixture of pagan, neoplatonic and Greek philosophical thought and their being "pseudo"-Sabeans does not affect our discourse.</div>    <P>
Amongst the things that Ibn an-Nadim documents form his sources about these Harrani "pseudo"-Sabeans, in his chapter on the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> is:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...their assertion about matter, the elements, form,  non-entity, time, place and motion is in accord with what <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> presented ...</blockquote>    <P>
These Harranian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> were versed in these affairs, the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> theory of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> amongst other things, and they were upon <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> in describing the Creator - and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negation of affirmative attributes) was alien and foreign to Islaam until the emergence of the likes of al-Ja'd bin Dirham (ex. 124H).    <P>
So <u><b>al-Ja'd bin Dirham</b></u> (as did Abu Nasr al-Farabi, the philosopher), entered upon the "pseudo-Sabean" or "Sabean" pagans and their <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a> and he took from their speech and their philosophy, and the way of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (negating the affirmative attributes) that they were upon.    <P>
And with respect to the manner of describing the Creator amongst this group, they described Him with attributes of negation, <u>sifaat salbiyyah</u> - and this means that they would say, by way of example, "He is not blind, He is not deaf, He is not oppressive, He is not this, He is not that..." and so on. Thus, they described Him with affirmation of <u>attributes of negation</u>, in other words affirming the negation "He is not blind" and so on. And similarly they described him with relative attributes, those which only apply in connection to something else  - this is like when we say, a father is only described as a father when a child exists, thus, he only takes on that attribute in relation to something else besides Him. So with respect to Allaah, they described him with <u>sifaat idaafiyyah</u>. And sometimes they would combine between these two ways - but in essence, <u>they would not ascribe any affirmative attributes directly to the Creator</u>.    <P>
So Ja'd was influenced by these people and he began negating the Attributes and he began to question them. Ibn Katheer in his al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah, (9/350) quotes from Ibn Asaakir regarding al-Ja'd:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> ... And he (Ibn Asaakir) mentioned that he (al-Ja'd) used to frequent Wahb ibn Munabbih [d. 110H] and that every time he came to Wahb, he would wash himself and would say, "It is good for the intellect", and he used to ask Wahb about the attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, so Wahb said to him one day, "Woe be to you O Ja'd! Cut short this matter from that (type of questioning), indeed I consider you from the destroyed ones. If Allaah had not informed us in His Book that He has a Hand, we would not have said that, and [if Allaah had not informed us] that He has an Eye, we would not have said that, and [if Allaah had not informed us] that He has a Self (nafs, meaning Essence), then we would not have said that, and [if Allaah had not informed us] that He has Hearing, then we would not have said that..." and he (Wahb) mentioned the Attributes such as ilm (knowledge), and <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) and others.  Then al-Ja'd did not tarry for long before he was crucified and then killed.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is what happened with Ja'd and this affair originated with him due to his interactions with the Harrani "pseudo"-Sabean, Hellenistic <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and that influence caused him to doubt and reject the attributes. And the basis upon which he doubted and rejected the attributes was because anything that had incidental attributes must be subject to events and incidents (hawaadith), and therefore created.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Jahm bin Safwan, the student of al-Ja'd bin Dirham, became bewildered by the same thing when he argued with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and utilized aspects of the Hellenistic (Greek) Philosophy to prove a creator - but when the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> asked him to describe His Lord to them, he became dumbfounded, because if he described Allaah with His Attributes, his proof for the existence of a creator would be undermined - and so he went and started questioning and denying all the attributes and inventing ta'weels, and Jahm also argued and debated Muqaatil bin Sulaymaan (d. 150H) who fell into <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> - they used to pray together in the latter's mosque in Balkh and would debate, with Muqaatil countering the bid'ah of Jahm with another reprehensible bid'ah, that of tasbheeh and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> - and we will discuss this in more detail in its own section below inshaa'Allaah.</div>    <P>
And al-Ja'd has another chain of narration which leads back to the Jew that poisoned the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), leading back to another Jew in Yemen - and we will speak about this separately.    <P>
And we see that not a single one of the Companions or their Successors - from the time of the departure of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) up until the emergence of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - ever described Allaah in this manner (using attributes of negation). And we have clarified the methodology that the Salaf were upon in what has preceded - and this <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a>, this denial of the affirmation of attributes (ithbaat us-sifaat) and the adoption of affirmation of attributes of negation - and the <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> that followed on from that - this came from the pagan Harranian Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and what they transmitted to the Muslims of their  tradition of pagan and Greek philosophies.     <P>
So the early Salaf, the likes of ath-Thawree, <a href='tags/abdullaah-ibn-al-mubaarak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah Ibn al-Mubaarak</font></a> and Hammaad bin Zayd and Fudayl bin Iyaad (all from the mid to late second century after hijrah), when they came across these people who were following the views of al-Ja'd and Jahm in questioning the Attributes and questioning the narrations or reviling them, they were stern against them and exposed and refuted their statements.    <P>
And this influence we are speaking of is noted by non-Muslim writers, in "Freethinkers of Medieval Islam", Sarah Stroumsa, an orientalist, notes, in the section entitled, "The Pagan Legacy of the Freethinkers of Islam" (p. 167) (and words in square brackets are ours):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>It thus seems that by the third Islamic century</b> [i.e. leading into 200H and thereafter], <b>one could encounter several manifestations of a critical attitude towards aspects of the monotheistic prophetology.

We bring this quote as an external third party source to corroborate what we are saying regarding these external influences so that we don't get the standard <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> response of "that's an anthropomorphist fabrication of history" towards everything that exposes or demolishes the foundations of their theology.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> So we want to trace these statements, these phrases that we hear and which form the basis of the <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a> we are dealing with - and we want to compare that to the Qur'aan and the Sunnah and what Allaah revealed to His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and what the Salaf were upon.     <P>
And we want to comprehend and understand, why is it that when a Sunni Affirmer (Sunni Muthabbit) says, "<i>I believe Allaah is above His Throne</i>", just as Allah has said in His Book, that it is possible for the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Negator (Jahmi Mu'attil) to say, "<i>This is disbelief and shirk as you have likened Allaah to a body amongst the bodies by specifying space and location</i>..." - how is it possible that such a situation has arisen - where a Muslim can be so deluded and misguided - thinking himself to be on the truth - having polluted his fitrah with the refuse of the philosophies of the pagan Chaldean-remnant Harrani "pseudo"-Sabeans and pagan Greeks, and not recognize the seriousness of what He is uttering and claiming regarding that which Allaah revealed in His Book - how can this possibly have happened? And this is the type of question we want to answer - historically.    <P>
So this is one piece of the picture - the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> amongst the Chaldean Harranian pagan "pseudo"-Sabeans - and we will cover the others inshaa'Allaah - and all of the Negators, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> they all drink from the same fountain - their differences with each other are on subsidiary issues <u>after</u> their agreement on the usool - yet the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> make a boastful display of having "<i>exposed the deviant <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites</i>" whereas in reality, they actually agree with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, Mu'tazilites in <u>the usool of ta'teel</u> - since they all drank from the same fountain - they only refuted them in subsidiary matters in which they differed with them as will be clarified elsewhere inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 5:</u> The Indian Philosopers - the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, Naturalists</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> are Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, who believed only in what can be perceived by the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste). They were naturalists who believe everything  comes about by and can be explained by natural causes and laws. They also believed in "tanaasukh al-awraah" which is transmigration of souls, the initial idea is from the ancient Greeks such as Plato, and is similar, only in some respects to reincarnation.

<font class='titleHeadline'><u>POINT 6:</u> The Debates of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> With The Indian Philosopers, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> - And The Foundational Basis Of The Negation of the Attributes By All Jahmi, Mu'tazili, Ash'ari, Maturidi Negators</font>    <P>
The foundational basis of the rejection of the Attributes (to varying degrees) is based upon a method of proving the createdness of the creation (and thereby the existence of a creator) which in turn forced all the Negators (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) to deny the Attributes (to varying degrees) in order to <u>remain consistent with this method of proof</u> - otherwise this method of proof would have necessitated that Allaah Himself must be created (on account of what is established for Him of Names, Attributes and Actions in the Book and the Sunnah).     <P>
<b><u>A Summary of the Essence of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Muta'zili, Ash'ari Proof by <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (Unnessential Attribute)</u></b>    <P>
Before we document the debates of Jahm and the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, we can summarise the essence of this proof - which is shared by the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (amongst the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) as follows - this is a broad outline:    <P>
<ul><li><b>First:</b> Everything we see in the creation - which is everything besides Allaah - is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), made up of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) - the most basic element of which is the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) - and when at least two of these particles come together they form a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - and bodies have unnessential incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>). These unnessential attributes can only exist in bodies and substances, they can't exist on their own. Thus a headache (unnessential incidental attribute) cannot exist without a man, and a pale complexion or a brown complexion cannot exist except in a body (i.e. a man), and colour cannot exist except in a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) such as a stone, a cloth and so on, and location and space cannot exist except in relation to a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and so on.    <P>
So everything we see is either <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) or <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (unnessential attribute). This is Aristotle's manhaj of understanding and classifying what is observed.    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> All bodies (ajsaam) are haadithah, which means they occurred after they did not exist.    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> And all unessential attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) must also be haadithah, which means they came about after they did not exist, because unessential attributes can only exist in bodies (ajsaam).    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> And bodies (ajsaam) are not independent of unnessential attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) - every body must have at least one amongst the many types of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (such as color, shape, taste, smell, heat, cold, wetness, dryness, texture, number, space, location, direction, posture, width, height, depth, motion, rest and so on).    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> And based upon the above, everything which is not free of having been subject to an occurrence or event (haadithah) - which includes having unessential attributes - or which did not exist prior to occurrences taking place in it (or it having any unessential attribute), is itself a new occurrence (after not having previously existed, or taken place) - thus all bodies and substances are occurrences themselves, because occurrences have taken place in them.     <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> Built upon the above, everything in the universe is haadithah and all occurrences, events (hawaadith) must have a beginning. It is impossible to have events, occurrences (hawaadith) for which there is no beginning.    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> Thus, all of this proves that the universe - [which is made up of bodies (ajsaam) that are made up of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, the smallest unit of which is the indivisible particle, (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) and unessential attributes (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>)] - is haadith (i.e. an event, or occurrence which did not previously exist).    <P>
<li><b>Next:</b> Everything that is brought about and occurring (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>) must have a muhdith (one that brings it about). And the one who brought about the universe is Allaah.</ul>    <P>
This particular proof, its foundation was first innovated by the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and they were followed by others in that, and it was formalized by the chief of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in his time, Abul-Hudhail al-Allaaf (d. 235H) and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> simply "<u>borrowed</u>" this from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and incorporated it in their books (<a href=indexe187.html?gmsin>see here</a>). The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are all upon the same foundational principles - do not let them fool you with anything else - they only argued with each other on what was necessitated by those foundational principles - this is where they differed. And Jahm used the basic outlines of this method with the Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> as we will cover below.    <P>
<b><u>Negation of the Attributes</u></b>    <P>
On account of <u>their insistence upon this method of proof which they made the basis of the religion</u> and which is derived from the basic principles of Aristotle's <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and unnessential attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) and the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> theory (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>) of <a href='tags/democritus.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Democritus</font></a> - they began denying the Attributes (<b>they had to, otherwise their intellectual proof would be rendered false</b>) and and they started inventing principles for the denial of the Attributes and Allaah's Actions - and from that which they invented and fell into was <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed, which they later unashamedly ascribed to the early Salaf.    <P>
<ul><li><b>The Jahmiyyah:</b> This began with <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> who negated all the Names and  Attributes and Actions to remain consistent in his argument against the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> - and those upon his way are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. He used an argument to prove Allaah's existence that was a basic form of what later deveopled as the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Ash'aris (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), and also the argument of the occurrence of accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) in substances (jawaahir, ajsaam) proving their created nature.    <P>
<li><b>The Mu'tazilah:</b> Seeing the negation of everything by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> being clear falsehood and the impossibility of denying the Names that are clearly mentioned in <a href='tags/the-quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Quran</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> affirmed the Names (although only on the surface) and negated the Attributes. Thus they argued with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - not on the foundational principle (the method of proving the createdness of the creation and thereby being forced to reject the Attributes of Allaah) - but on a subsidiary issue, the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> rejection of the Names.     <P>
<li><b>The As'hariyyah:</b> They were forced to invent other principles to enable the Kullaabi affirmation of some of the Attributes as opposed to others - again in order to keep consistent with the method of proving Allaah's existence and the createdness of the creation. So they invented principles (that we will cover elsewhere inshaa'Allaah) to avoid falling into to same problem as <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, so they found a way to affirm some attributes as opposed to others. So they argued with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - not on the foundational principle (the method of proving the createdness of the creation and thereby being forced to reject the Attributes of Allaah) - but on a subsidiary issue, the Mu'tazilite rejection of all of the Attributes.</ul>    <P>

Imaam Bukaaree said in "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" (p.9):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Damurah said: From Ibn Shawdhab: al-Jahm abandoned the prayer for forty days due to doubt. He argued with some of the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, became doubtful and spent forty days without praying.</blockquote>    <P>
There occurs in the book  "Buhooth Fil-Milal wan-Nihal" (3/437), that debates with these Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, was something that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon also, the author speaking about the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And then the period of ar-Rasheed came (170H-193H) and history narrates about their vigour during his time, to such an extent that there were none who argued with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> besides them...</blockquote>    <P>
So we see that these types of debates with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the mulhids (atheists) were what led to the evolution of this approach. Those who pioneered this approach (in laying down this rational proof) were the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the Mu'tazilites in the second century after hijrah, and when the Ash'aris came they simply adopted the same foundations - and especially the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, after <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> who took the Ash'aris much more down the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> path.    <P>
<u><b>Jahm Debating the Sumaniyyah: Part 1</b></u>    <P>
We can now move onto Jahm's debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> said in "ar-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah" (page 93 onwards):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So from what has reached us of the affair of al-Jahm, the enemy of Allaah, is that he was from the people of Khurasaan, from the people of Tirmidh, and he was a person of much disputation and theological rhetoric (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>), and most of his theological rhetoric was regarding Allaah... So he met a people amongst the disbelievers called the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>. So they came to know Jahm and they said to him: "We will argue with you and if our proof overcomes you, you will enter our religion, and if your proof overcomes us, we will enter your religion".    <P>
So from the things that they spoke to Jahm about was that they said to him: "Do you not claim that you have an ilaah (deity)?" So the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> (i.e. al-Jahm) said, "Yes". So they said, "Have you seen your deity directly?" He said, "No." They said, "Have you heard His speech?" He said, "No." They said, "Have you smelt any fragrance of His?" He said, "No." They said, "Have you been able to touch Him?" He said, "No." They said, "Have you perceived him with any senses?" He said, "No." They said to him: "So you don't know that he is a deity?". So Jahm became bewildered, and did not know what he was worshipping for forty-days.</blockquote>    <P>
So they overwhelmed Jahm and argued against him by saying that this proves your ilaah (deity) is non-existent, because he cannot be perceived by the five senses. So went and thought and tried to find a way to overcome them.     <P>
Imaam Ahmad continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Then he redressed [this defeat by devising] a proof similar to the heretics of the Christians. The heretics of the Christians claim that the spirit that is within <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (Jesus) is the spirit (rooh) of Allaah, from Allaah's Essence. So when He (Allaah) wants to bring about something, He enters into some of His creation and speaks upon the tongue of that (created person), and thus He commands with whatever He wills and forbids with whatever He wills. But is a spirit that is absent from (the people's) vision.    <P>
So Jahm devised a proof just like this one and so he said to the Sumnee: "Do you not claim that there is spirit (i.e. soul)  within you? He said, "Yes." He (Jahm) said: "Have you seen your spirit?" He said, "No." He said: "Have you heard its speech?" He said, "No." He said: "Have you perceived it with the senses or been able to touch it?" He said, "No." So he (Jahm) said: Thus is Allaah, He has no face that can be seen, and no voice that can be heard, and no fragrance that can be smelt, and He is absent from (the people's) vision, and He is not in any one specific place exclusive to another..."</blockquote>    <P>
Then <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> says that he found three verses in the Qur'aan, "<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>..." (42:11), and "<b>He is Allaah in the Heavens and in the Eart</b>h..." (6:3) and "<b>No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all vision</b>..." (6:103).     <P>
And <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> continues later:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Thus, he instituted the religion of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. And when people asked them about the verse, "<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>..." (42:11), what is its explanation (tafseer)? They would say:    <P>
<blockquote>"<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>..." from amongst the things. And He is beneath the seven earths as He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, no place is devoid of Him, and He is not in any one specific place exlusive to another. He has not spoken and does not speak. He has not looked towards anyone in the world, and nor (will He) in the Hereafter. He is not described (with anything). He is not known by any attribute or any action. He has no limit or end (i.e. demarcation). He is not grasped by the intellect. He is the face of all of it (i.e. existence). He is the knowledge of all of it. He is the hearing of all of it. He is the seeing of all of it. He is the light of all of it. He is the power of all of it. He is not two things. He is not described by two different descriptions. He does not have a "highest" and a "lowest" and nor directions or sides, neither a right nor left, and neither is He light nor heavy, and He does not have color, or a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and nor is He known (ma'loom) or understood (ma'qool). And everything that you (imagine) in your heart which is considered a "thing", then He is different to it.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
So we see that all of this is negation (salb) - these are all <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> salbiyyah (attributes of negation) - Jahm described Allaah with negatives. And all of this came about due to his debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>. And he was also the student of al-Ja'd bin Dirham. And this is what al-Ja'd bin Dirham took from the Harranian "pseudo"-Sabian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, who were the remnants of the Chaldeans who described Allaah only with <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> salbiyyah (attributes of negation).    <P>
And the explanation of the above is since the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> only believed in what was perceivable with the senses, Jahm indicated to them - [using the argument he derived from what the Christians hold regarding <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (alayhis salaam)] that Allaah is everywhere and in everything - just like souls occupy their bodies (the Sumaniyyah) and just like they cannot see, feel, touch, and hear or perceive their souls - even though souls occupy them, then similarly Allaah is everywhere but cannot be seen, felt, touched, and he is not described with anything with what things are described with. And thus he managed the repair the damage that the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> had done to him which had bewildered and confused him. And in this manner, he tried to impress upon those Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
<u><b>Jahm Debating the Sumaniyyah: Part 2</b></u>    <P>
We can take upon another element of Jahm's debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, and remember the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> were Naturalists, part of their belief was that everything exists due to natural causes and can be explained by way of them. So there is no creator - everything has always been there and natural causes explain everything.    <P>
So we'll take up this matter from the words of Shaykh Salih Aal us-Shaykh in his sharh of al-Hamawiyyah:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and al-Jahm bin Safwaan ... was a faqeeh, he had something of knowledge of fiqh, and he made some ijtihaad in debating this faction of Naturalists, those who spoke with the transmigration of souls and this is the faction (called) the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, a faction from the factions of Khurasaan and India. He argued with them regarding the existence of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and they confused him, until they said about him, "He is perplexed", and so he spent forty days not praying on account of the severity of his bewilderment.    <P>
And this was because he argued in the debate without expansive knowledge of what is necessary and desirable in arguing with the likes of those (people).     <P>
This led him to try and establish the existence of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for them and he did not find any evidence by which he could establish the existence of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, except what later become called the way of "<b>hulool, or <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam</b>"  (the occurrence of unnessential attributes in bodies), or the way of "<b><a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a></b>" (the indivisible particle).    <P>
This way has its own details, however the intent here is that it is a way that opposes that which came in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah of affirmation of the existence of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and what the human fitrah necessitates that a man did not originate by his own action, and nor by the action of his parents, and there have been brought together within him (i.e. in his body) such instruments with an amazing composition - it is impossible to everyone with intellect that time or nature brought them into existence in this amazing manner.    <P>
But he took that path, which is the path of "<b>hulool ul-a'raad fil-ajsaam</b>" (the occurrence of unessential attributes in bodies) and he said, that an unessential attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) cannot self-exist (be established of its own accord) - and unessential attributes, such as colors, and the four natural qualities of heat, cold, wetness, dryness, and the likes of elevating, lowering, movement and so on. These are unessential attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) in a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>).    <P>
So when (the matter was) like this, he (Jahm) said: These unessential attributes occur in an inanimate body (al-jism al-jaamid), and it is not possible that the inanimate body brought about those incidental unessential attributes by itself - rather they were brought into existence into it (by an external agent).     <P>
Similarly, this inanimate body, if we break it up into smaller parts, we will eventually end up with what they call <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle), and this indivisible particle, which is the single particle or the single part, this also has an unessential attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) from amongst those that we have mentioned.    <P>
And it is known that this single particle is not able to bring about that unessential attribute for itself. It cannot bring about ascent (rising) in itself, and nor coldness, heat, or wetness and so on. So it is known, therefore, that this (attribute) must have been brought about in it (muhdath, by an external agent), and if it was placed in it like this, then it must have a muhdith (the one who brought this attribute about into it).    <P>
And when (the affair is) like this, then this small particle, or this body in which incidental attributes occur, then it departs from the judgement of having been brought about by nature, because it is not possible for this particle, which is nature itself, to bring about those types of effects (on itself).    <P>
<b>So the intent here is that they conceded to him that bodies (ajsaam) must have a muhdith (one that brougth them about). So they said to him: "Who is this Muhdith?" He (Jahm) said, "He is my Lord, He is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic". So when they conceded to him (with this argumentation), he rejoiced. And then they said to him: "Describe your Lord to us". But when he wantd to describe Him on account of what has come in the Qur'aan, of the Attributes, he became more bewildered. </b>    <P>
Because he found that if he described Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with what has come in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then that will falsify his evidence which he mentioned, because if he described Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic with "ar-Raheem (the Merciful), who possesses rahmah (mercy)", then mercy is an unessential incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>), mercy is not a body in itself that can be seen, it exists only as an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (incidental attribute) [which according to this proof, can only exist in a body, and thus this body must have been brought about (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>)].    <P>
So this meant that this incidental attribute (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) must have ocurred in a body, and this would have falsified his evidence which he brought. Because they would have said: "Who is the one that brought about this mercy in your Lord, O Jahm?". So he looked into the attributes, such as those (denoting) motion, like al-majee' (coming), and al-ityaan (arrival), and he looked at <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, which is ascending over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and so on. So he became bewildered, confused.    <P>
And when he did not find any proof for Allaah's existence except for this one, he said (in thought, to himself), "<i>This is my definitive proof and it is necessary that everything that weakens this definitive proof, or which falsifies it, must be interpreted (with ta'weel)</i>" so he began to distort (make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of) all of the texts of the Attributes.    <P>
And this is what the <u>Mu'tazilah followed him in</u>, then <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u>, then <u>the Ash'ariyyah</u> and so on.</blockquote>    <P>
So the above is clear and self-explanatory. So Jahm in his debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> had to - reject all of the Attributes - in order to keep his intellectual proof intact. And this is why Jahm began to deny what he denied.     <P>
<ul><li><u>He denied that Allaah spoke to Moosaa (alaihis salaam)</u>. Why was that? It would have meant that an event (haadith) occurred in Allaah, in that He spoke to Moosaa, after having not spoken to Moosaa. So this is an event, and events only take place in bodies, so Allaah must be a body, so Allaah cannot have spoken to Moosaa, and only in this manner can we establish Allaah is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that is subject to events. So we see the origins of "<a href="tags/jahmeespeak.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmeespeak</font></a>".     <P>
<li> <u>And likewise, he said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was created</u>, if the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was Allaah's speech, then in places, Allaah speaks the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in relation to events which took place, and this means Allaah's instances of speaking occurred after those instances of speaking had not occurred -and thus this is an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (unessential attribute) or a haadith (an event) - and in any case, the whole <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, if it is Allaah's speech, is an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> and a haadith, and thus this would mean that Allaah is a body (like the created bodies) that is subject to <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and hawaadith. So this means that the Qur'aan cannot be his speech (according to Jahmeespeak) - and thus it must be something created - otherwise it demolishes our (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) argument against the Atheists and Naturalists. And the Mu'tazilites followed Jahm in that, the Kullabites followed the Mu'tazilites in that - but concocted their own saying - of Kalam Nafsee - and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> followed their predecessors in that (the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, Mu'taziliates, Kullaabites) - and they were all compelled to this, because of what they made the foundation of their religion.    <P>
<li> <u>And Jahm negated there is a Lord above the heaven, above the Throne</u>. Why because aboveness, elevation is an incidental attribute of a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), so this must be negated from him, in order to keep the intellectual proof intact. So Allaah is not above, rather he is everywhere according to the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and he is neither inside the universe, nor outside of it, according to the Mu'attil <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.    <P>
<li> <u>And the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> negated Allaah's <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> fi'liyyah</u> (like <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> and so on) because these actions necessitate hawaadith, and <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (unessential attributes or occurrences events, attributes that occurred after they did not exist) - and this would necessitate Allaah is a body subject to events, which would falsify their intellectual argument and show that Allaah must be created - so they had to reject these attributes. </ul>    <P>
Now we can relate to why Jahm negated what he negated and why he spoke with the bid'ahs that he spoke with. And now the origins of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> and of <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a> should start to become more and more clear - and now we can see why these people were forced to take the positions they took. All because they made the demonstration of the created nature of the universe with the use of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> and <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> to be the foundation of their religion.    <P>
And then they made all of this to be Tawheed, so Tawheed became stripping Allaah of His Names and Attributes until He became but a notion of oneness that exists only in the mind - devoid of Names and Attributes or any form of description (to the Jahmites) and negation of the Attributes (to the Mu'tazilah) and negation of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Khabariyyah (to the Ash'arite Kullaabites) and so on. So this is what they made Tawheed into - to strip Allaah of His Attributes which He affirmed for Himself. Why? Because of their rational argument of "<b><a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a></b>", through <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> and <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (al-jawhar) and <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> (al-'arad).    <P>
And when they took this approach - they were forced to dispute with each other on subsidiary issues - and so we see the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> disputing with the Mu'tazilites, and these two disputing with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - but the asl of them all is the same - they only dispute in subsidiary issues in relation to what can and cannot be denied (to keep the rational proof intact) and what methods can and cannot be used to achieve this rejection.    <P>
And we see some Ash'aris who hold <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is the way (to negate Allaah's attributes in order to keep the intellectual proof intact) refuting other <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who hold tafweed is the way - and vice versa. And we see the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> refuting some of the Mu'tazilites for claiming that the smallest particle is in fact <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> infinitely - but they both hold onto the notion of <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> - the basic principle and they argue only on subsidiary details. So do not be deceived by their philosophical <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a>.    <P>
And every Muslim in whom there is sound fitrah knows the falsity of this and that this is not the deen of the Messengers, and this is why the smart amongst the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, they say to their common folk, "You just need to know the very basics of your creed, don't go too deep..." due to their knowledge and realization that the inherent fitrah of a person will reject what the Mu'attilah have made to be the usool of their religion.    <P>
We can now see more clearly the realities, the origins of <a href='tags/jahmeespeak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmeespeak</font></a>, and the evolution of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed as a means of accommodating what has come in the Book and the Sunnah under the umbrella of what they acquired from the philosophies of the Greeks and from the "pseudo"-Sabean Harranian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and what they fabricated in order to win debates with the Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Naturalists.     <P>
