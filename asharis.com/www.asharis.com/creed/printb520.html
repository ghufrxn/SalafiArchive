<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Paper Background: Predication, Immutability, the Ten Categories</font>    <P>
Before we move on to the paper, a few things need to be clarified. The author will be discussing the issue of predication and immutability. <i><b>Predication</b></i> is simply to assign a quality, attribute or property to a thing. And <i><b>immutability</b></i> means the inability to change, to not undergo any type of change. Now <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> spoke a lot about the issue of predication, and this was a linguistic discussion, however, this was integrally tied to his syllogistic logic, by which the truthfulness of propositions is evaluated. A proposition is simply to say "A is B", such as "the tea is hot." You have probably heard of this before, its like this:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>All A's are B's<BR>  X is an A<BR>  Therefore X is a B</blockquote></div>    <P>
So since the truth and falsehood of propositions was integral to attaining knowledge to <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the issue of predication in the language, as in assigning qualities and  properties to things, was discussed in detail by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. Likewise, he also laid down what are known as his Categories, which is known as <b>al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b> (substance and incidental attribute) or <b>al-Maqulat al-Ashar</b> (the ten categories). The intent of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> here was to <u>comprehensively categorize</u> everything that can take the place of a subject and a predicate in a proposition. In the proposition "<i>the tea is hot</i>", the "<i>tea</i>" is the subject and "<i>is hot</i>" is the predicate. So he came up with ten categories and everything in the universe is either a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (jawhar, jism) or nine incidental attributes, and incidental attributes are found only in substances. All of this <u>created the framework</u> upon which his logic and philosophy could be built. These ten categories are presented below:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The first category deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (a'raad, also referred to as "accidents") which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol></div>    <P>
Once this is clear, what we need to understand is that these aspects of Aristotle's philosophy already affected those amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians before it affected the Muslims. And so what we are going to do here is look at the theology of a Jew and a Christian before Islam came (we will look at the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in a separate article altogether). One is <b>Philo</b> (20BC-50CE) was a Jew from Alexandria who was present around the time <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (alayhis salaam), and the second is <b>Augustine</b> of Hippo (d. 430CE), a Christian. Now, you will see a stark resemblance between the language of their theology and the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, in fact its identical. the ilm al-kalaam, of the Ahl al-Kalaam is not so original. Rather, it's simply the second-hand, used and abused toy of the past nations (Sabeans, Jews, Christians). Unfortunately, when it came into the hands of the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), they took it and lapped it up like a kid does a ice-cream, not realizing that there has been many a nation, or scholastic whose already "<i>been there, done that</i>." So pay attention, we will be discussing predication, immutability and negating Aristotle's ten categories from Allaah - which is essentially what the deen of the Mutakallimin is founded upon - as opposed to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, which is:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>To affirm for Allah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him without <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (which include tafwid), takyif, tamthil, tahrif (which includes ta'wil) and tashbih, and there is not any tashbih in anything that the revealed texts affirmed for Him by consensus of the Imaams of the Salaf.</b></div>    <P>
So let us now proceed to the paper itself:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Philo, Predication and Immutability</font>    <P>
Discussed first is Philo (the Jew of Alexandria) predication and immutability.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-b.gif border=0>    <P>
The author begings by pointing out how theists of religions used conceptual tools forged by pagan <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> to contstruct their theologies. He mentions how some amongst them found this deplorable. This is parallel to how the people of the Sunnah and Jamaa'ah likewise found this deplorable from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> [and Ash'ariyyah] who were guilty of using the exact same conceptual tools. This, as the author points out, necessitated that there was some part of religious belief for which these conceptual tools were either necessary or helpful. He treats these conceptual tools like a Trojan horse. After this opening, the author  takes two or three pages to go into some detail on the theory of predication and we don't really need to go into that, we are just interested in the effect of these theories, terms etc. upon Philo and Augustine. So he first discusses Philo:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-c.gif border=0>    <P>
We see here the statement that the "property" of God is that He is the unchanged, and this is an ambiguous statement. For Allaah has never ceased possessing all of His attributes, so in that regard He is not subject to change. Yet Allaah also has actions tied to His will and power, and Allaah never ceased to be the doer of whatever He wills, and these actions are established with His essence, and this [meaning, the issue of both attributes and actions] is what the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a>, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims (from the Mutakallimin) were debating about and trying to philosophically arrive at the truth regarding what God can or cannot be described with in order to maintain what they believe is unicity in His essence.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-d.gif border=0>    <P>
Again what they mean by God being unchangeable, is the same as what the Mutakallimin refer to when they negate attributes and actions (which they refer to as <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, incidental attributes and hawaadith, events).     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Allaah never ceased having all of His attributes, and His attributes are eternal, along with His essence, and multiplicity of attributes [considerd by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as a'raad] does not mean multiplicity of the essence.  And likewise, in refutation of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, Allaah never ceased being one who does whatever He wills, having actions tied to His will and power, and actions established with His essence [considered by all the Mutakallimin, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, as hawaadith] does not necessitate that Allaah himself is <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (originated). </div>    <P>
However, what Philo stated above that "it is impossible for the essence of God to have been understood at all by any creature" is true, since no one knows the reality of Allah's dhaat (essence).     <P>
We now come to look a particular problem raised by "predicating" (assigning) to Allaah more than one property, and here we see the shubhah that was found amongst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and also those <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> ascribing to Islam regarding tarkib (composition) which they used to deny the attributes, and which the later <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> used to deny the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-e.gif border=0>    <P>
What is being said here is actually very similar to the doubt of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in that if you  assign any property to Allaah, then this means there are two components to Allaah, and thus multiplicity of properties, qualities, attributes necessitates multiple eternal entities along with Allaah. However, if it can be said that the attributes are nothing but Allaah''s essence itself, then you resolve that problem, and thus, Allaah's hearing is but His essence, and likewise seeing, life, knowledge, will, power and so on. This was one of the ways the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> tried to deal with this issue and the other way was to say that the attributes of Allaah are other than Allaah, meaning that which is created, from His creation, just like we say, "Messenger of Allaah", "House of Allaah", "She-camel of Allaah", and thus, when we say, "Speech of Allaah", it means what He creates in others of speech, but it is metaphorically said to be His speech.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So the intent here is that the likes of Philo thought they could use the tools of pagan <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> to maintain what they believed to be the unicity and immutability of Allaah. But <u>there is a difference</u> here between Philo and the Mutakallimin from Islam (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), in the sense that what the Mutakallimin were motivated by in devising their theology was the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies through presence of attributes and actions within them), which came to them from the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, who themselves had used the conceptual tools of the Greeks.     <P>
<b>They made this proof to be the ultimate truth withoutt which Allaah's existence could not be established, and then they were forced <u>to adhere to all its binding necessities (lawaazim)</u>, that is  deny Allaah has names, attributes and actions so that He is not a body like the originated bodies. All the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah were fighting each other over was what can and cannot be rejected without clashing with this proof and what mechanisms can be used (ta'wil, tafwid) in order to reconcile the revealed texts that pertain to the attributes with this proof.</b>    <P>
So Philo's use of these conceptual tools is not from the same angle as that of the Mutakallimin, however the intent here is to simply show how the concepts and philosophy of a pagan disbeliever, a worshipper of stars and idols influenced and corrupted the beliefs of many a nation before the Mutakallimin of Islam ever set foot on earth by hundreds of years and that when  they came along, all they were inheriting were there broken toys of the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians before them who had already had their fun and games,  in fact, they had had fun and games played over them.</div>    <P>
Now <u>this is where it gets juicy</u>, lets discuss Augustine, and you have to seclude yourself, and pay good attention here:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Augustine on Divine Immutability, Incidental Attributes [Accidents] and Aristotle's Ten Categories</font>    <P>
The author then discusses Augustine's theology:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-f.gif border=0>    <P>
Just read that again and pay attention to what you see:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As Augustine puts it slightly later,    <P>
<blockquote>in created and mutable things what is not said according to the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> remains to be said according to the <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>. For all things happen by <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a> to them [omnia enim accidunt eis], which can be either lost or diminished - both quantities and qualities - along with what is said [in relation] to something - as friendships, relationships, servitudes, similitudes, equalities, and things of this kind - <b>and positions, states, locations, times, actions, and passions</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
The list is a famous one - the ten predicables canonized by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in the Categories (l<sup>b</sup>25-2<sup>a</sup>4) and the Topics (I, 9, 103<sup>b</sup>20-24). <b>Augustine's maneuver is to lump together the nine categories other than <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, counting them all as accidents</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
You have to really appreciate the significance of what you have just read (and what you will read further below). What you have just read above is the foundation of al-Ja'd bin Dirham and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> claiming Allaah never took Ibrahim as a friend (with khullah), and that Allaah never spoke to Moses with speech that Moses heard, and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is makhluq, <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (created, originated), and that Allaah does not perform <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, and that there is no Lord "above" the creation or or "above" His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. Seriously, it can't be stressed enough. This is like a bombshell. We don't know how to put it. Let's try:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><div align=center><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;"><b>Shaykh Agustine of Hippo, the Great Christian Mutakallim of the Pre-Islamic era</b></font></div></div>    <P>
Now a whole book could be written here, and there is not enough space in article for us to say and explain everything we would like to. But for now, we see here the deen of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> preceded by <b>OVER 500 YEARS</b> at least - that's half a millenium. So here we have a Christian, affected by the concepts of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, arguing for the immutability and unicity of Allaah through the negation of accidents (incidental attributes, a'raad) from Allaah, using Aristotle's Ten Categories.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is <u>identical</u> to  the theology of the Mutakallimin, from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah, <u>with the difference</u> that the Mutakallimin were drawn, or actually forced into using this type of language (of "negative theology"), because they all adopted the proof of <b>huduth al-ajsaam</b> (origination of bodies) in order to argue for Allaah's existence. They considered this proof to be something without which Islam cannot be defended and Allaah's existence cannot be proven. Then they were forced to abide by its necessities (lawaazim), and its necessities are to deny from Allaah <u>the ten categories of Aristotle</u>, whose language this proof was based upon. This proof was devised by the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who alongside turning to star-worship, still believed the universe was originated. Hence, the language of "<i>Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), not in place (makan), not in location (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>)</i>" and so on, this became the language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. And this was also the language of Augustine, the Christian "Mutakallim" at least 500 years earlier. </div>    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">So <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> folks! Please, how long are you going to continue in your fraud? Don't deceive yourself, you can't falsify history. At least admit that the roots of your theology is based upon the language of a pagan Greek disbeliever, star and idol-worshipper, which came to you through the books of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> because you took the proof of huduth al-ajsaam from them, and they took it from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and they took it from al-Ja'd bin Dirham, and its in all your books:</font></blockquote>    <P>
Go and check your books:    <P>

The proof of huduth al-ajsaam is in all their books. <b><u>IT IS THE ULTIMATE FOUNDATION OF THEIR THEOLOGY</u></b>. However, when its falsehood became apparent to some of the later ones amongst them, they started incorporating other proofs, the proof of tarkib (composition) and the proof of takhsis (specification) into their works - and both are taken from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> themselves - in order to cover their backs and to hide that vulnerability. Others were not smart enough to realise the flaw in huduth al-ajsaam, so they remained upon it, defending it. And this is why you will see that intellectual cripple and mental spastic called <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> using the proof of takhsis (specification), little does this pretentious fool know that <u>this is the proof of Ibn Sina</u> and that this cunning kafir formulated this proof in order to corrupt the proof of huduth al-ajsaam for the Mutakallimin, and that's an altogether separate article, one in which the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far (<a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?ecqjj>see here</a>) will be polished and made ready for this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> pretender.</font> </blockquote>     <P>
Thus, what you find above from Shaykh Augustine [the pre-Islamic era "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" Mutakallim], is the foundation of the deen of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> [and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah] who deny what they call hawaadith (events, occurrences) and by which they mean Allaah's chosen actions (<i><a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i>, <i><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i>).     <P>

This is an amazing short passage. A whole paper can be written on these three verses alone.     <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">In short, Allaah has freed and exonerated Himself from everything He is described with which is false [in relation to both His Uloohiyyah and al-Asmaa wal-Sifaat], and whatever did not come from Him, and this is the saying of all the wandering, straying deviants from those of the abrogated religions and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and star-worshippers and their likes. It is also a repudiation and rejection of what the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) describe Him through the use of "negative theology" which they inherited from the Sabean star and idol-worshipping disbelievers through the proof of huduth al-ajsaam. Then Allaah stated that security, peace is upon His Messengers, and this means that in everything His Messengers brought of His names, attributes and actions, then there is safety, and they brought nothing but the truth, and there is nothing objectionable in any of that, and His Messengers were the most knowledgeable of the creation with respect to Him, and they conveyed knowledge of Him in the most-eloquent way, and they were most sincere in wishing guidance for their people. So these three qualities, that they are <u>a'lam</u> (most knowledgeable), <u>afsah</u> (most eloquent), and <u>ansah</u> (most sincere), means that their way was the <i>a'lam</i> (most erudite), <i>ahkam</i> (most precise), and <i>aslam</i> (most safe) - and with that the claim of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi, lying deceiving, surmising, self-aggrandizing self-righteous bigots is rendered the greatest falsehood and greatest of affronts to Allaah and His Messenger, for their saying necessitates that the heritage of the pagan Greek and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is <i>ahkam</i> and <i>a'lam</i> over what the Messenger of Allaah brought! And this is the reality of their saying, except that they are the greatest of cowards, and they wish to protect themselves from the scorn of the people, just like the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> used to try and protect themselves from the scorn of the people through concealment, trickery and deception.    <P>
And then consider the affront of <a href='tags/abu-hamid-al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hamid <a href="tags/al-ghazali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ghazali</font></a></font></a> (d. 505H) in his book <i>Iljaam al-Awaam</i>, for he says that the language that Allaah and His Messenger chose is not the real truth, rather it is nothing but tajsim and tashbih and that the real truth lies in their language which they inherited from the Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshipping disbelievers, that of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, but then he excuses Allaah and His Messenger by saying that since the Arabic language was not fit to carry and express the eloquent truth, and since the average person was <u>too dumb</u> to understand the real truth (which is their "negative theology"), then it was necessary for Allaah and His Messenger to use such language, even if it gave the presumption of tajsim and tashbih, so as not to make those <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>dumb commoners</a> flee from faith. To have a majority (of dumb commoners) believing in Allaah, even if it be through this way, is far better than having the majority turning atheists and only having a handful of elites (meaning their arrogant selves) believing in Allah through the real truth (i.e. through the language of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Mutakallimin). So it was a necessity - and such is the saying of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, to the letter - go and read it all in all its repugnance and filth <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>right here</a>, and then don't be surprised to see that kafir, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H), who is supposed to be an enemy of the Mutakallimin saying the exact same thing, and he said it before these As'harites, and they took it from him, take a look <a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>right here</a>.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And <u>if this shocks and surprises you</u>, then you should know - as we explained in <a href=index2670.html?kagzi>our previous article</a> - how the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) are actually united with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (like al-Farabi, <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, who were following the thought of the Greek Philosophers) as it relates to the issue of belief in Allaah, in that the real truth lies in the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, and what is necessitated by it, even if they differed on the details.  But as for their real contention, that is something different, the issue of the eternity and origination of the universe, and resurrection and prophethood and revelation, and this was where the real battle was, because the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> saw them using a corrupt flawed proof (huduth al-ajsaam). So do not be an ignoramus on this matter, otherwise those heretics will easily deceive you into thinking  they were the saviours of Islam, when all they did was to open up the door wide for the enemies of Islam who let loose their vanities upon the Islamic texts, beliefs and rulings.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Augustine of Hippo, the "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" Mutakallim of the Pre-Islamic Era and the Negation of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (Incidental Attributes) and Hawaadith (Events, Occurrences)</font>    <P>
Next the author spends some time covering a chapter that Shaykh Augustine, the Mutakallim, had written regarding the negation of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes, accidents) from God. Its a lengthy piece, so we don't want to waste space quoting it all, we will simply provide a summary of it all here, so basically Shaykh Augustine, the pre-Islamic era Christian Mutakallim, the forerunner of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, he explains that incidental attributes or accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) are of three types:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first</b> are "<u>inseparable accidents</u>" which do not separate from the essence, and he gives the example of the black colour of the feather of a raven. The black color is inseparable and it only expires when the raven dies and turns to dust. <b>The second</b> are "<u>separable accidents</u>", and he gives the example of the blackness of a man's hair which can turn white, not by virtue of it being separable, but by virtue that its blackness is merely an incidental property. <b>The third</b> are "<u>accidents with degrees</u>" and this means the variation in a particular quality, or attribute, such that it has gradations, degrees. Now this third type is really  an overlap of the previous two, and it refers to those qualities which can be diminished or increased. So Shaykh Augustine denies all of these <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes, accidents) from God.</blockquote>    <P>
The thing to note here is that there are some meanings which are certainly correct. Take for example, Allaah's knowledge and power, does it have degrees? Of course not, it is absolute, all-inclusive. So this is certainly rejected, but when the Mutakallimin (the Jewish, Christian and Muslim ones) resorted to using these types of conceptual tools, language and classifications in trying to describe Allaah or to negate for Allaah, they rejected much of the truth along with it.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And so they rejected His names, attributes and His actions (upon the differences between themselves as to what they considered was binding from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam) because they wrongly considered that this knowledge that relates to bodies (ajsaam) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) is such that the necessities (lawaazim) arising from them as it relates to this universe, are also applicable to Allaah, the Most High. To illustrate, if something created is said to be "above", then it necessitates that it must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), since being "above" can only be said of "bodies". They held that the same necessities apply to Allaah, such that if it is said about  Allaah that He is "above" [something Allah Himself says, and His Prophets and Messengers said, and the Righteous Salaf had consensus on], then the same necessities (lawaazim) must also apply to Him, and this would therefore mean He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and hence this must be rejected and all the texts pertaining to this matter, must be interpreted figuratively. However, what they have done here is to make a false analogy for Allaah, for they fell into <b>qiyas al-shumul</b> (analogy by inclusion) in that they included Allaah within all the bodies, such that whatever lawaazim (necessities) apply to created bodies, must also apply to Him, if that language is also used for Him. And this is clearly false.  Upon that basis, they used this conceptual language in order to decide what can and cannot be ascribed to Allaah. And this is a false type of analogy, and this is the foundation of their misguidance.</div>    <P>

However, when they saw the Mutakallimin refuting the true and real <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, who were also Ahl al-Kalaam, like Hisham bin al-Hakam al-Rafidi, he was a Mutakallim, upon that ilm al-kalaam of huduth al-ajsaam and al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, and likewise the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, they too were upon this very ilm al-kalaam. So they considered the conclusions of those Mutakallimin to be true and then they tried to reconcile between those conclusions and the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. And because they saw those Mutakallimin taking the path of <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> or tafwid or both, they considered that to be acceptable and they wrongly presumed it was the way of the Salaf. So they erred in this matter. And as for Abu Ya'laa, he got affected by the Mutakallimin, on the subject of Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>), which they called hawaadith (events) and tried to deny them, and likewise he exaggerated in <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> (affirmation) and he was not like those repugnant <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from the Ahl al-Kalaam, be they Raafidites of Hanafi Karraamites, but he erred from the angle of affirming fabricated narrations and bringing disrepute upon himself, and allowing himself to be censured and maligned.    <P>
So when this is clear and this is apparent, it is not longer permissible for any <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> to use any of these Scholars as a justification to remain upon an incorrect creed, and remember that these names they use of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar, they only use them as a front, what they are really calling to is the "Heretical Ash'ariyyah", that of <a href='tags/al-juwayni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwayni</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and al-Aaamidee. It is not what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was upon at the end of his life when he transitioned away from the usool of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and adopted the creed of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and it was for this particular creed that some scholars either spoke well of his book al-Ibaanah (like Abu Uthmaan al-Sabuni) or may have ascribed to him, like they would have ascribed to any other Imaam of the Sunnah when they saw what he manifested of the truth and ascription to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and this would include people like <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> and others.</font></blockquote>    <P>
From the above two paragraphs, you will come to understand the <b>grand deception</b> of today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and how they rely upon people's ignorance of the fact that there are different types of "Ash'aris" so to speak, and that they use certain names only as a front, and what they are really calling to is nothing but a creed founded upon the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad and that was the very ilm al-kalaam that the Salaf severely condemned and declared its practitioners as diseased heretics. So we exonerate the likes of <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, and Ibn Hajar from that, for they never indulged in that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> like those Mutakallimin did, but they lived in an era, growing up whilst this was considered in their lands to be the truth, and so they thought the conclusions of these Mutakallim were the truth, and so they are not to be put alongside those heretical <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who hybridized Tajahhum, I'tizaal and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> with the Kullaabi original that even <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself transitioned away from.     <P>
