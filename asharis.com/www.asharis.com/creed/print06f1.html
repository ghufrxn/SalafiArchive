<div class='sidebar'>In <a href=index81d7.html?mwbop>Part 1</a>, we gave a brief historical account of the origins of the theology of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Mutakallimin) and  established that what we have in their theology is simply a belief in God characterized through the language of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> and that this conceptual baggage came to the Mutakallimin through the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who were present in the Muslim lands and from whom it was acquired by al-Ja'd bin Dirham who spread it in the Ummah through al-Jahm, his student, and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> [they were the first to say Allaah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, and is not above His creation, and will not be seen in the Hereafter and that He did not speak the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and so on], then to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, then to the Ash'aris and others. In <a href=index0e7c.html?dktlu>Part 2</a>, we looked at two "<u>fundamental principles</u>" that <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> claimed and we exposed how fundamentally and principally, <u>they are both stolen from Aristotle</u>, and we gave a side by side comparison between what the revealed Books, sent Messengers, the Salaf and Ahl al-Sunnah say and between what <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the Hellenized Jews, Christians, <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> say - and through that the fraud of <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> was laid to waste, and for the wise and intelligent, that much would have been sufficient. In this article, we start addressing his alleged comparisons, and as we said before, because he is <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>a proven academic fraudster</a>, <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> doing a comparison survey is as safe as letting the fox count the sheep and tuck them into bed. [Yes, of course we believe you that you are totally impartial to all interests, (even your own)]! Or its like an imperialist power setting up its own tribunal and choosing establishment figures to see whether it was justified in looting and plundering another nation.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibnt-philosophers-comp1.gif hspace=5 vspace=3 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>1st Comparison: The Claim <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> Believes Allaah is an "Eternal Body"</font>    <P>
This is the first of al-Naruiji's frauds and you can see his comparison table to the right. There are numerous issues raised here and they include a) whether <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> believes and states "<i>Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body)</i>", b) the citation <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> made to make this allegation against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, c) the issue of tasalsul (infinite regress, or endless chain). Inshaa'Allaah we will address the first two issues in this article.    <P>
Readers should by now be familiar from <a href=index81d7.html?mwbop>Part 1</a> and  <a href=index0e7c.html?dktlu>Part 2</a> that speaking of Allah in terms of "negation of jismiyyah" is a purely Aristotelian concept taken straight out of Aristotle's treatise on <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a>. The Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> played with Aristotle's conceptual baggage in their own theological language and thus a particular language can be found in their books which revolves around  bodies (ajsaam) and accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and negating Aristotle's Ten Categories from Allaah. See this illustrated clearly in <u>Philo the Jew of Alexandria</u> (50CE) and <u>Augustine of Hippo</u> (430CE) and the (post Christian era) <u><a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a></u> in these five articles [(see   <a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>here</a>, <a href=index5cf8.html?fsbea>here</a>, <a href=index03de.html?wfjmn>here</a>, <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>here</a> and <a href=index2670.html?kagzi>here</a>)]. This was the very "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" that all the Imaams of the Salaf condemned and declared as a heretic anyone who spoke on its basis with respect to <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a> and attributes. This is the history that academic shysters and fraudsters like <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> wish you don't learn about and find out about. Hence, anyone who disagreed with the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and did not speak with their innovated theological language was accused of claiming Allaah to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and when they (the Ahl al-Kalaam) submitted to the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that this conceptual language and baggage is the platform upon which their differences can be debated (such as on the issue of the eternity of the universe or its origination), they were forced to adhere to all the binding necessities this conceptual baggage required from them in their speech in describing Allaah or negating from Allaah. Then in turn, they tried to impose this upon Ahl al-Sunnah who had nothing to do with this at all, and were free and innocent of it and who condemned and refuted the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> in their time (second, third centuries). This is why objective history (of the first three hundred years hijrah) scares the wits out of cowards and fraudsters like <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<blockquote>  <b>[Ibn Taymiyyah and Jismiyyah]</b>    <P>
Al-Naruiji said:    <P>

<b>First:</b> This is buhtaan (slander, fabrication) upon another Muslim, and whoever reads any of the books of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> knows for sure that he does not say Allaah is a "body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)" or an "eternal body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)." <b>Second:</b> The position of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is that Ahl al-Sunnah do not come under the jurisdiction of "kalaam theology" such that they can be accused of holding Allaah is a "jism (body)" if they do not adhere to the language of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> in describing or negating from Allaah. We have elaborated on this matter in more detail in our refutation of another academic fraudster by the name of <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> (<a href=indexc546.html?alnor>please read it here</a>), (<b>The Jurisdiction of the Language of Kalaam</b>), and we can cite from it the following which establishes our intent:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>The Salaf have a particular language</b>, it is simply a language of affirmation of what is in the revealed texts with a general negation of any likeness. They do not see any conflict between reason and revelation, revelation guides and reason submits and follows and sound, uncorrupted reason has no objection to what comes in revelation pertaining to the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>. Ahl al-Sunnah believe that there is absolutely no likeness unto Allaah, as a result, no false analogies can be made for Allaah, and hence, as Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, the necessities (lawaazim) that are said of all created things and bodies do not and cannot apply to Him. As a result, there is absolutely no caution in affirming what Allaah affirmed for Himself with a general negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>. This creed is completely outside of the jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, because the Messenger (alayhis salaam) came to do away with all false speech concerning Allaah, the Exalted, from which is the speech of the Hellenized Jews, Christian and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. This is what is alluded to by Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) who said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "<i>Dhamm ul-Kalaam</i>":    <P>

<blockquote>The Tawheed of the people of knowledge and the jamaa'ah of the Muslims is "<i>I testify none is worthy of worship except Allaah (alone) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah</i>". And the Tawheed of the people of falsehood is disputing about al-a'raad (incidental attributes) and al-ajsaam (bodies) and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent with the rejection of that.</blockquote>    <P>
And as for the Innovators, strayers, <b>the factions of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, they have another language</b>, which operates on the presumption of conflict between reason and revelation, and this language they operate upon is what they took from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> those nations had already indulged in and which led them to the same "negative theology" that the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of Islaam adopted in speech about Allaah (meaning, making use of specific negations in describing Allaah as a prominent feature of their theological speech). And the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> try to <u>qualify the speech of Allaah and His Messenger</u> with this particular language of theirs. These were the people referred to as "<b>people of desires</b>" when they were doing this in the time of the Salaf. They were looked down upon, scorned, despised, abased, humiliated and considered as diseased, who disease the hearts of others.    <P>
So we have <u>two different languages</u> and the necessities required by the language of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> <b>do not apply</b> to the people of the Sunnah and Aathaar, for the simple reason than dung and blood (ilm al-kalaam which is the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad) do not mix with pure milk (the revealed texts). Thus when a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> mu'attil says "<i>if you say Allaah is this, it  <u>necessitates</u> He is that</i>," these necessities do not apply to us because we reject the theoretical foundations which they are based upon. This is similar to when a person walks by a supermarket and then an employee from that supermarket - who has subscribed to the dress code, rules, regulations, ethics and  language required by the employer - tries to impose the way he is required to act and behave and speak upon the one who is not an employee and has not agreed upon such code, ethics, language or behaviour. While two employees may dispute as to what is right and wrong about any particular matter, based upon the underlying rules, regulations, culture, ethics etc. of the employer, this discussion is foreign and alien to the one who is not an employee and nothing is binding upon him and no necessities can be imposed upon him. Ahl al-Sunnah are not obliged to incorporate these necessities which they see as false in the first place, because they are founded and rely upon <u>false analogies</u> being made for Allaah (<i>qiyas al-shumool, qiyas al-ghaa'ib alaa ash-shaahid, qiyas al-tamtheel</i>) - which are analogy through inclusion, analogy for the unseen with the seen and analogy through likeness - and what this means, for example, is that when it is said something is "above" it must be a body, then Allaah is analogised with all created things such that He enters into the genus of all things about which if it is said "above" it must mean it is a body. However, this is false because it assumes Allaah's essence is like all other essences, yet <u>Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences</u> and hence these necessities do not apply. Thus, we can safely say, "Allaah is above the Throne" and that false necessity does not apply here. This is what the Salaf were upon with respect to <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and all the other <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes) and the af'aal (actions).     <P>
It is with this understanding that you will realize why the Salaf never debated these diseased individuals and it was not from their methodology to speak or debate with them, it was only refutation, warning, and vilification of them in front of the people, because once you agree to speak to them and debate with them, <b>there is an implied understanding that you have agreed to enter and come under their <u>jurisdiction</u> of kalaam</b>, because all of their speech with you will be founded upon the requirements and the necessities of the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>.So when you engage them, this is what they want you to enter into... So you have to really understand this issue of "<b>jurisdiction</b>," the language and necessities of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> do not apply to us, and we are outside of its jurisdiction. If you go back and read the accounts of the debates of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, you will see <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> not entering into their jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and they failed to bait <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in this regard, he was too smart and clever for them, walhamdulillaah, and he debased and humiliated those slimey, conniving <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> walhamdulillaah. You will also see this observation of ours with respect to Abdul Azeez al-Kinaani al-Makki's (d. 240H) account of his debate with that diseased Bishr al-Mareesee al-Hanafi al-Jahmee, in the book <i>al-Haydah</i>. So a Sunni, Salafi, Athari has to be wise with these things and not be stung by these heretics, and he ought to know how they should be addressed, (<u>from a position of authority</u>), subsequently subdued, tied up with their hands behind their backs, their necks to their knees, disciplined with the leafless branches of palm trees (as per the advice of Imaam al-Shaafi'ee) and then rolled into a nearby ditch for good measure - and this is simply a metaphor for educational purposes - and it is being used to illustrate how a Sunni Muthabbit ought to manifest his superiority in argument over the Jahmee Mu'attil, such that it is as if he has physically subdued him and owned him.</blockquote></div>    <P>
<b>Thirdly:</b> we see Ibn Taymiyyah's position clearly explained in all of his well known books and his position is that the use of the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) in both affirmation and negation is a reprehensible bidah (innovation) in the religion. We can bring only a small sample of quotes here: He said in Minhaj al-Sunnah (2/135):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the word <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), <b>it is an innovation (bid'ah) in both negation or affirmation</b>, there is not in the Book or the Sunnah and nor the saying of any of the Salaf of the Ummah and it's leading Imaams who applied the word "<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>"  with respect to Allaah's attributes, neither in negation nor in affirmation.</blockquote>    <P>
He said in '<i>Bayaan Talbees ul-Jahmiyyah Fee Ta'sees Bida'ihim al-Kalaamiyyah</i>' (tahqeeq: al-Hunaydee) (1/283):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And those who said that He is a "jism (body)" are of two types: <u>The first:</u> And this is the saying of their scholars - that He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) but not like the [created] bodies, just like it is said, a dhaat (essence, self) but not like the [created] essences, and mawsoof (described) but not like the [created entities that are] subject to description, and a thing (shay') but not like the created things. So these people say that He, in His reality, is not like those besides Him from any angle at all, however this affirmation (of jism) is merely (to indicate) that He has a real existence by which He is distinguished [from whatever is besides Him]. Like when we say, "mawsoof" (something being subject to description), then this is an affirmation of a reality (haqeeqah) that (a thing) can be distinguished by... ...And as for <u>the second type</u>, they are the majority,  those about whom it is narrated that they said, 'He is flesh and bones' and similar things to this. This saying of their's which is the most obvious corruption, if He had been flesh and bones - as it is understood - then what is permissible upon (the created types of) flesh and bone would be permissible upon Him, and this leads to the <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> (resemblance to the creation) that Allaah has negated from Himself...</blockquote>    <P>
Then he said, after that:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...So whoever speaks with this <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> (resemblance), which comprises such <a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a> (<a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>), then he has made Him like the [created] bodies which are other than Him, [considering] Him to be greater in status [in this tajseem], and this is clear and manifest falsehood from both a rational and sharee'ah point of view. And such people are the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphists</font></a>) whom the Salaf have criticised. And they (the Salaf) said: "<i>The Mushabbih is the one who says: Seeing like my seeing, and Hand like my hand and Foot like my foot</i>", and so this is making resemblance in the genus (jins) [of a thing], even if that being attributed with resemblance is greater in status than that to which it is being resembled. </blockquote>    <P>
And he says in <i>Dar' al-Ta'aarud</i> (10/306):    <P>

This is only a small sample of literally hundreds of statements  which can be found across all of Ibn Taymiyyah's works. Now, when the deceiving lying fraudster <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> knows this full well, and he is not ignorant of this fact, he chose to act like the vermin he is by finding an obscure passage upon which he could base his allegation, and we shall look at this next. But before that, for the sake of completion, we should cite statements of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi scholars on the usage of the word "<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>", and if for argument's sake, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> permitted the use of the word "<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>" (which is completely untrue and false), then what is the  most that intellectual fraudsters like <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> could have said?

From al-Eejee in his <i>al-Mawaqif</i>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...So the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, that is, some of them, said, "He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), meaning, existent (mawjood)". And (another) people amongst them said, "He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), meaning established by Himself (qaa'imun bi-nafsihi)". <b>So there is no dispute with them upon [either] of these two explanations except in the naming, meaning in the application of the word "<a href="tags/al-jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a></font></a>" to Him</b>. </blockquote>    <P>

So what was the quote he used as evidence to prove <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> holds Allaah to be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)?

Now we won't translate this just here, because it will not make sense until after we have provided the background. So here goes:    <P>
<b>[The Imaams of the Salaf (Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ahmad bin Hanbal), the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> of Allaah, and the Discussions Between <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> Such as Abu Ya'laa]</b>    <P>
All revealed Books and all sent Messengers came with the belief that Allaah, the Exalted and Sublime, is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, above the creation, and that His essence is unlike all other essences. This is what the Companions and Taabi'een were united upon. When al-Ja'd bin Dirham brought the conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> into the Ummah, taking it from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, in the form of the kalam cosmological argument that was with the Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a> (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub>see here</a>), he abided by its necessities - [Allaah cannot be described with anything that the bodies He caused and brought into existence are described with]  - and thus he was the first one to deny Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and to deny Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter, and that Allaah spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with speech tied to His will and power and that Allaah spoke to Moses direct and that Allaah took Ibraaheem as His khaleel. This denial was based upon this proof of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad that was used to argue the origination of the universe. This was then spread by al-Jahm bin Safwaan and from him it was taken by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> such as Amr bin Ubayd and others. However, <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, following his debates with the Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>), who confused and perplexed him began to say that Allaah is in all places and is not in one place exclusive to another and that there is nothing over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and there is nothing that Allaah can be described with such that His existence is one separate to that of His creation.     <P>
This saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> spread, namely, that Allaah is everywhere, on this earth, in the heaven, within everything in the creation, not separate from it and so on - and alongside this, He cannot be seen, nor heard, nor perceived in any way, and nor can He be described with anything that give Him a distinct existence from all that is besides Him. These sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of both <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> (indwelling) and <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (divestment) regarding Allaah and His attributes emanated from al-Jahm's debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and also what al-Jahm took from al-Ja'd bin Dirham from speaking about Allaah with negatives (sifaat salbiyyah) which al-Ja'd took from the Sabean Harranian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (following on from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam). And it became from their well known sayings,  "<i>we do not believe in a Lord that is in one place exclusive to another</i>" - and this phrase and this terminology was their invention, and by necessity this meant that they had to deny Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, since if He was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it would clash with their belief. At first <u>they did not initially raise this specific matter</u>, as their falsehood would have become readily apparent, because this matter was firmly established in the hearts of the common folk (their fitrah), let alone the Scholars. So instead they raised the other issues of seeing Allah (ar-Ru'yah) and that of the Qur'aan being created, and through these affairs they were hinting or alluding to Allaah not being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but were not saying it outright at first.    <P>
So when these people emerged with this orientation before the middle of the second century (around 125H onwards), the Imaams of the Salaf knew what they were trying to do and this is why you see statements from the Salaf from <u>at least before 131H</u>, such as the following from the great Imaam, Ayub al-Sakhtiyaani:  Abul-Qasim Sulayman bin Ahmad at-Tabarani brings in "<i>Kitaab us-Sunnah</i>", as does <a href='tags/adh-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabi</font></a> in "<i>Mukhtasar al-Uluww</i>" (p.132-133) from al-Abbaas bin Fudayl al-Asfaatee from Sulayman bin Harb who said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I heard Hammaad bin Zayd (b. 98H, d. 179H) (saying): I heard Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H), the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were mentioned, so he said: "The central axis of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven".</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='tags/adh-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabi</font></a>, in his "<i>Mukhtasar al-Uluww</i>" commented on this saying: "This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd)." And also from Hammaad bin Zayd, as reported by Imaam ad-Dhahabee, in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.146):    <P>

So note here what Hammaad bin Zayd said that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, in their speech, they were circulating around the issue of wanting to express that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without going as far as saying that explicitly.

So when this occurred and the Imaams of the Salaf knew and understood what these people were intending (that Allaah is in every place), we find statements from them in refutation of this and in clarification of the truth and some of the Salaf expressed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1581;&#1583;</span>) "<u>bi haddin</u>" (with demarcation) - meaning by this that Allaah is not within the creation, rather He is separate and distinct from it, in opposition to what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were trying to spread amongst the people, that Allaah's existence is indistinguishable from the creation and does not have any independent definition that would otherwise remove it from the realm of non-existence into the realm of existence as a distinct essence which possesses attributes. In the second half of the second century, this doctrine was propagated by Bishr al-Mareesee al-Hanafi al-Jahmee (d. 218H). So within this context a number of statements were related from the Imaams such as Ibn al-Mubaarak who stated Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with a (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1581;&#1583;</span>) "hadd."  Their intent by this phrase was to defend the truth and repel falsehood, and the likes of this term, when it has a meaning of truth, then it is from the baab (field) of <u>al-ikhbaar</u> (informing) about Allaah, which is wider than the field of the Names and Attributes.    <P>
In the Tabaqaat ul-Hanaabilah of Ibn Abee Ya'laa there occurs (1/267):    <P>

He said, "Above (fee) the heaven, upon ('alaa) His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with a hadd (limit, demarcation)." So Ahmad said, "This is how it is with us". </blockquote>    <P>

So now we have our context and we understand what is going on. In the face of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the Salaf affirmed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, separate and distinct from the creation, and this is why the Imaams from the Salaf spoke with the likes of these terms (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1581;&#1583;</span>) "<i>with demarcation</i>" and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1575;&#1574;&#1606; &#1605;&#1606; &#1582;&#1604;&#1602;&#1607;</span>) "<i>separate and distinct from His creation</i>", meaning that Allaah is not within the creation, not merged with it - so the debate is between the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and the Salaf used these phrases. At this point we have to remember that on one side is the entire Ummah who affirm Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, with His essence, and on the other side are the vermin, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who claim this is <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and kufr. <img src=assets/images/aristotle-right.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=5 border=0>This is  according to the <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i>, if something has the incidental attribute of "above", then it must be in spatial location (as they see it), and following on from this, it must be a body, since bodies have magnitude, hence it is kufr to affirm what Allaah revealed in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). This is because <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the Shaykh and Imaam of the Mutakallimeen taught so, when he said in <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> 12, "<i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence...</i>" Now, when it came to the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (d. 241H), he also spoke, but he had a number of sayings, one in which he confirmed what Ibn al-Mubaarak said that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1581;&#1583;</span>) "<i>with demarcation</i>" and this is famous and well-reported from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> through his associates and it is also reported from Ishaaq bin Raahuyah (d. 238H). And the other in which <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> said (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1588; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601; &#1588;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1603;&#1605;&#1575; &#1588;&#1575;&#1569; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1581;&#1583; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1589;&#1601;&#1577; &#1610;&#1576;&#1604;&#1594;&#1607;&#1575; &#1608;&#1575;&#1589;&#1601; &#1571;&#1608; &#1610;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;</span>) "<i>That Allaah, the Exalted, is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> how and as He wills without any hadd or sifah which anyone describing can reach or which anyone can define</i>..." which is reported by al-Khallaal. So we see here that which appears to be conflicting views in the statements of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, but the reality is not like that.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The Issue of Hadd Clarified:</b> The issue is simple, hadd has a number of meanings, the first of which is that it refers to that by which an entity is distinguished from another such that the two do not merge and mix, and the second simply means "definition" as in to define something (through its attributes), and when you give something a definition (through its attributes), you have automatically brought it from the realm of non-existence into existence, and it can also mean to define and explain the reality (haqiqah) of a thing in words (and this is not possible for Allaah or His attributes). So when hadd is affirmed, it means that Allaah has an essence that is separate and distinct from His creation, and possesses attributes and when it is denied, it is a denial of any descriptions and definitions of the reality of how Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (or of the reality of how His attributes are), so this is the tahdeed that is negated. And as for those who contradicted these clarifications (through the affirmation or negation of hadd), then the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> fell foul of the first (the affirmation of hadd) for they said Allaah is everywhere and cannot be described with anything (this essentially means He is non-existent, because there is no existing thing except that it has multiple attributes the description of which brings it from the realm of non-existence to existence), and as for the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, they fell foul of the second (negation of hadd) for they began to define (make tahdeed) of how Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, so they said that He fills <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, or is proportionate to the width of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and other such falsehood and they brought such tahdeed (definition) which the revealed texts never came with. So the affirmation of hadd is for the deniers of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) and the negation of hadd is for the Mukayyifah amongst those who affirm <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> - since those who affirmed <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> included not only Ahl al-Sunnah but also factions of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> such as <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, and one has to appreciate that the statements that come from the Imaams of the Salaf had different contexts and were made with respect to different situations and factions.</div>    <P>

Before we look at that, the following should be clearly borne in mind:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>From the above historical context, if we imagine we are now in the early fifth century hijrah (after 400H) we basically have two groups: The Imaams of the Salaf and factions of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, from them <u><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></u>, <u>al-Harith al-Muhasibee</u>, <u>al-Qalanisee</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></u>, <u>Ibn Mahdee al-Tabari</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></u>, and we have others such as <u>al-Qadee Abd al-Wahhaab al-Maalikee</u> (d. 422H) - [see <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?pombh>this article</a> about his position on <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> which is <u>a Hiroshima</u> under the seat of today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as Asharis] -  and likewise we have the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> too (who are Mujassimah), and there are many  more Scholars from the fourth and fifth centuries we have ommitted who affirmed <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, even  if they were affected by something of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in their speech. <b>All of these are on one side</b> and they all affirmed (with their various expressions) that Allaah, <u>with His essence</u>, is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> amongst them never saw that to be in conflict at all with the proof of huduth al-ajsaam - this only came with the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>.

<b>[The Quote from Ibn Taymiyyah]</b>    <P>
With the above historical context set, <u>we now know exactly where <a href='tags/al-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> is positioned in the overall scheme of things</u>. And once that is cleared and out of the way, we can now come to Ibn Taymiyyah's coverage of Abu Ya'laa's attempt to explain the speech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in affirmation and negation of "hadd" for Allaah, and we can summarize his entire discussion with the following points, and we are using the 2006 print, ten-volume edition of <i><a href='tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a></i> and the section is at the end of volume 2, the last 20 or so pages, and the beginning 30 or so pages in volume 3.     <P>
<ul><li> From (2/612) in the second volume through to (2/628) <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> documents all the statements related from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> about both the affirmation and negation of hadd, after which he comments:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So this speech from Imaam Abu Abd Allaah Ahmad (rahimahullah) explains that he denied that the servants can define (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1610;&#1581;&#1583;&#1608;&#1606;</span>) Allaah, the Exalted, or His attributes with a definition, or to give it any estimation, or to be able to reach [the reality of] its description and that does not conflict with what has preceded of the affirmation that He has a hadd (demarcation) which only He knows and no one else knows (of its reality), or that He describes Himself (with attributes). And such is the speech of all of the Imaams of the Salaf, they affirm the realities (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1602;</span>) and deny the servant's having knowledge of their quiddity (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1606;&#1607;&#1607;&#1575;</span>) [as in exactly how they are], just as we have mentioned from their sayings in other than this place which explains all of that.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is clear, there is a tahdeed (giving of definition of <u>realities</u>) which is denied, then there is another tahdeed (mere statement of attributes but not their realities) which is Allaah affirming for Himself the attributes and actions we find in the revealed texts (so this is Allaah defining Himself through descriptions arising from Himself), and then there is affirmation of a hadd (that by which Allaah is distinguished from whatever is besides Him) which is affirmed for Him (as a refutation of the Jahmites), the reality of which none knows but He.    <P>
<li> After this, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> then discusses (2/629) how the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a>, when they saw these two types of statements from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, they had different approaches towards their interpretation.  So he says that some of them saw a contradiction and negated "hadd" and quoted those statements and others affirmed "hadd" and quoted those narrations, and others interpreted the "hadd" to be in reference to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and others affirmed both sayings, and others gave a different explanation for the negation of "hadd". <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explains that negation (of hadd) was the approach of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> first but then he had other sayings too. Here we reach the end of the second volume.    <P>
<li> In the third volume (3/3 onwards) <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> documents the statements of al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (who was an Ash'arified Hanbali) regarding <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, and explains how he, along with other Ash'arified <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> like <a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-bin-al-zaghuni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan bin al-Zaghuni</font></a> (d. 527H) would speak with the negations of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and such express the negation of hadd (demarcation), <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> (direction), <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> and ta'leef (composition) and the likes. But then later he turned back from denying hadd and <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>.     <P>
<li> Then <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> discusses (3/21-25) how <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> tried to interpret the speech of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> regarding affirmation and negation of hadd for Allaah, and within his interpretation he claimed that the hadd (demarcation) <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was <u>affirming</u> when mentioning Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is that Allaah has a hadd (demarcation) in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and the hadd that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was negating when mentioning Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, is the negation of Him having a hadd in any other direction.     <P>
<li>  After this (3/25) <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says (about Abu Ya'laa's interpretation):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I say: This (explanation) by which He reconciled between the two sayings of Ahmad, and (in which) He affirmed a hadd (demarcation) in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, below, as opposed the other five directions opposes how he first interpreted the saying of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with an explanation that agrees with the explicit words of (<a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>), when he (<a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>) said, "For he (<a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>) has negated hadd from Him for the mentioned attribute, and it is [negation of] (the hadd) that His creation knows." (i.e. negation that the creation knows the hadd of Allaah)</blockquote>    <P>
In other words, about the sifah (of Allaah being above the Throne), <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> said about it Allaah (being above the Throne) has a hadd (demarcation) but whose reality none of His creation knows, and this is all that was meant by <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. This affirmation of hadd here is to indicate that Allah exists above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He does not exist everywhere, in all places, but rather He exists with a hadd, the reality of which nobody knowns (following from the fact that nobody knows the reality of His essence). And this is the view that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is supporting and it is the truth.</ul>    <P>

<b>[The Meaning of This Quote]</b>    <P>
By now, from everything which has preceded, this should be clear and it is as follows: When the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> claimed Allaah is not above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, but is in all places, and cannot be distinguished such that it can be said He has a distinct existence - and when it is the belief of all of Muslims that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, the Imaams of the Salaf made a statement affirming a "hadd" (demarcation) for Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and their intent was to simply state that Allaah is distinct from His creation with a hadd that only He knows of, which His creation do not know of and which distinguishes His existence from the existence of what is besides Him. However, some <u>Kalaam Hanbalis</u> (poisoned by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and speaking upon speculation), when they tried to make sense of Imaam Ahmad's affirmation and negation of "hadd", they stated (in one of their opinions) that the "hadd" <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is speaking of is that which is in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but not the other directions, and this is an error, and this is what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is hinting at in the above comment after quoting <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>. Rather, those who used the word "hadd" against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (like Ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah) applied "hadd" unrestrictedly, and simply meant that Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and His essence <u>is not infinite</u> (as opposed to what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were saying) and hence, His essence has a hadd, <u>the reality of which no one knows but Allaah himself</u>, and this is all that these Imaams meant, alongside their affirmation that Allaah is indeed above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and they never added any further speculative speech or discussion. Rather they spoke with what was sufficient to refute the falsehood of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and then remained silent. <b>At this point please remember</b> that we are in the house along with all of Ahl al-Sunnah, and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their early followers and other factions of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> such as the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and the many other scholars influenced by <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> who were all united that Allaah Himself is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His essence. After being united upon this there is discussion between them about language and terminology and expression, "<i>Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a jism</i>", "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (but with the meaning of mawjud)</i>" as the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> said, and "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with a hadd</i>", "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without a hadd</i>" and so on.

A person of sound fitrah and reason can grasp what is being said above and there is no caution in any of that and it is nothing but what is contained in the revealed texts, that Allah has a true and real existence, outside of the mind, outside of His creation, with an essence described with attributes, and He informed that He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and thereafter He is not "infinite" with His being otherwise there would be nothing in existence except Allaah, and thus we would be led to the aqidah of <a href='tags/hulool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hulool</font></a> (indwelling) and wahdat ul-wujood (unity of existence) and for that reason some of the Imaams of the Salaf employed certain terms in order to distinguish and protect the belief of the Muslims, hence we find what is related from Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ishaq bin Rahuyah and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and all <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> did  was to document and clarify their sayings and correct those who wrongly particularized their statements. However, as is usual, the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> do not make mention of this, because their intent is to deceive the people and make it look as if <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is the originator of all of this, when in fact, the issues arose in the time of the Salaf in their refutations of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>However, we have to understand the infatutation of these people with "bodies", "shapes" and "sizes" and where it stems from. It comes straight out of <u>Metaphysics 12</u>, so let us remind ourself with a few quotes from the Shaykh of their Shaykhs, <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> Bin Nicomachus, "the First Teacher", <i>The unmoved mover is infinite, since it causes infinite motion. It follows that it is also without magnitude, since an infinite force cannot reside in a finite magnitude (and there can be no infinite magnitudes); having no magnitude means that the first mover is indivisible, having no parts</i>, and also, "<i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence... As being a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> without magnitude, God is without parts and, therefore, indivisible (magnitudes are divisible)</i>" and also, "<i>It has been shown also that this primary essence cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible.</i>." This language is not what the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah came with.</div>    <P>
Once you understand this you can see that their objection to Ahl al-Sunnah arises because they believe the God of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (in as far as the above descriptions by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> are concerned) is the true and real description of God and that the God of the apparent texts of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Prophetic Sunnah is, to use their evil and wicked words, "<i>a limited body with parts located in space</i>" (which must be given figurative interpretation) and they said this because they placed the kalam and aql of a pagan, star-worshipping disbeliever, above and beyond the revealed texts (naql). <b>Finally</b>, we say to this al-Naruiji' and all other Asharite pretenders (who pretend to follow <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> when they are in fact his disputants and disputants to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and all of their early followers): <b>Distinguish your God for us from one two things at the same time: a) from non-existence and b) from being all of existence</b>.

Thereafter, the truth will be known whether you are upon the beliefs of the Sunni Muslims and whether you drink from the fountain of revelation in seventh century (CE) Arabia, and the fountain of the Sahabah, Tabi'een, their followers and greatest Imaams of the Ummah in the first three centuries or from the fountain of a star-worshipping idolator of fourth century (BC) Greece, his language and conceptual baggage which came to the Muslims in a box labelled "<i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>", after it had passed through and excreted by the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>.    <P>
