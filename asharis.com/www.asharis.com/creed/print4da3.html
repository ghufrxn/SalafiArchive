<img src=assets/images/saeed-foudah.gif align=right width="120" style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;border-radius:6px;" border="1" border=0> The contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as "Ash'aris" have raised an issue regarding the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1575; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), in particular the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) which occurs in some manuscripts as (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) and which is in agreement with narrations from the Salaf who preceded Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. In this series we want to address the claims of one considered to be from the kibaar (senior) amongst the  <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> (pictured). Historically, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have always been considered corrupt in intellect and our case sample (Foudah) in these articles will be a confirmation of this trend. The reader will find truly laughable the attempt of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> to distort the statement and intent of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (in its historical context) who clarified the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah with respect to the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.     <P>
<b>The key lesson to take away from this series is that <u>history</u> is one of the routes through which the lies and fabrications of the deviants and innovators are exposed. It is known that the Sahaabah, the Taabi'een, the Muhadditheen and the Scholars of Ahl al-Hadeeth have utilized history and the historical record to falsify matters which on the surface appeared to be authentic and coherent, whether that be in relation to claims of history or chains of narration.</b>    <P>
One should also note that people like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and their ancestors are the students of the <b>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</b> and they are not the students of the <i>Sahaabah</i>, <i>Taabi'een</i> and <i>Taabi' Taabi'een</i>. The isnaad (chain) of their theological speech goes back through  the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to those same Hellenized Jews, Christians  and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and eventually to <b>Aristotle bin Nicomachus</b> (d. 322BC) whose speech about the "<i>first cause</i>" is the actual foundation of speech regarding the deity of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. <b>At least al-Qaradawi is very frank and open about it</b>. See the little incident in the kitchen between al-Qaradawi and G.F. Haddaad, (<a href=index09b7.html?snaca>domestic problems</a> in the house of kalaam) to learn more.  </blockquote> </div> <P>




<p><blockquote>In this article we are going to review the statement of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> in corroborating the belief of the Salaf regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.  But before we do so, a quick review is necessary:    <P>
In <a href=index8b97.html?fedxmjq>Part 2</a> we established the statement of the Salaf (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1571; &#1608;&#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583;</span>), "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah, it commenced with Him (as speech) and to Him shall it return</i>" and we explained the reason why this statement was made, at which point in history  it was made and the intent behind it. History is crucial in exposing the deceptions of the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the first important point of refutation that was made in <a href=indexa2c8.html?ctuiuhq>Part 1</a> was the origin of the denial of Allaah speaking and acting through will and choice (<i>ikhtiyaar</i>), which comes from the star and idol-worshipping <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> of 4th century BC, and how the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> carried this belief to the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and how the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> formulated their doctrine of <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> on the back of this corrupt belief which clashes with every revealed Book and every sent Messenger and the companionship of every Prophet. Another historical note is now going to be  made, and this is:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What Exactly Were the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Intending When They Said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created?</font>    <P>
So what we want to know from history is exactly what were the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> referring to when they said "the Qur'an" is created? And in turn, this forces a second question: For what did the Salaf make takfir of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the second and third centuries <u>before</u> <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> came along? In other words, what was the battle centered around?    <P>
As we have already established, the doctrine of <i>kalam nafsee</i> only appeared after the early third century hijrah from <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. Which means that it was impossible for the dispute between the Salaf of the second century and between the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to be centred around the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> (meaning in the self of Allaah). <b>So The answer to this is very simple, since history cannot be falsified or changed</b>. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were intending <u>the Arabic Qur'an</u>, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that everybody knows, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is heard, written, memorized. It was the words of this Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said were created. This is because the entire ummah, in fact every single nation on the face of the Earth, was agreed that speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is both meaning <i>and</i> wording, and that is why it was not until the third century when <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> came along and innovated a third saying that the Imaams of the Sunnah raised the issue and began to refute it such as al-Imaam <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> (<a href=index532f.html?awgru>see here</a>). Prior to this the matter was never contested, and the Salaf held that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the actual speech of Allaah in meaning and wording together, spoken by Allaah with a <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> that is unlike the voices of the creation, which was heard by Jibreel and conveyed to Muhammad (sallallaau alayhi wasallam). We shall discuss Foudah's doubts about <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> (<i><a href='tags/sawt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sawt</font></a></i>) in a separate article. But the historical fact here is that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> intended the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, since the whole ummah never knew except one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Thus when the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> said, "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>" they meant the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And when the Salaf said "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not created</i>" they meant the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And thus, there were only two views, that of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and that of the Righteous Salaf. A third view was not innovated until well into the third century after hijrah by <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> that was then popularized by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in the days he was a Kullaabi.     <P>
<b>Now if <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> claims other than this historical fact, that there was some other <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (i.e. the <i>kalam nafsee</i>) that was the subject of dispute in the second century hijrah other than the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, then let him bring us his evidence.</b> And this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> fraudster can not and will <u>not</u> <i>ever</i> bring anything of the sort. This is because the view he himself is pushing (as we shall see), is the very view of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who are his predecessors in this belief of <i>kufr</i>, that this <u>Arabic Qur'an</u> was not spoken by Allaah with actual speech but it is merely a created entity amongst the entities that can be attributed to Allaah in the same way other created entities are ascribed to Allaah (<i>Allaah's House, Allaah's Messenger, Allaah's She-camel</i>). Save that <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> is a con-man who uses very clever wording to make things sound and appear otherwise (as we shall see in a detailed treatment of his speech inshaa'Allaah).     <P>
So we now have numerous matters of historical record in front of us:     <P>
<blockquote><b><u>a)</u></b> the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> denying the <i>first cause</i> acts through will and choice (ikhtiyaar), this was adopted by all the factions of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> without exception and they refer to Allaah's speaking and acting through his will and choice as <i>hawaadith</i> (events) (<a href=index4da3.html?oiobnfy>see clarification)</a> <b><u>b)</u></b> the <i>kalam nafsee</i> doctrine arose through Ibn Kullaab's inability to answer the doubt of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding <i>hawaadith</i> which itself is taken by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> of negating ikhtiyaar (choice) from their first cause, and this is what carried through to the Ash'aris and Maturidis by way of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <b><u>c)</u></b> the <i>kalam nafsee</i> doctrine is founded upon the alleged poetry of a Trinitarian Christian called <a href='tags/al-akhtal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Akhtal</font></a> and it came to surface after the tribulation of the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> after the early third century hijrah and it involves a distortion of the language of the Arabs, <b><u>d)</u></b> the dispute between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Salaf was regarding <u>the Arabic Qur'an</u> and nothing else. </blockquote>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes on al-Tahawi's Creed on the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font>    <P>
There is such a refutation and annihilation of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> in these words, that one is amazed at how bold and brazen <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> like him are in fabricating lies against the Imaams of Ahl al-Sunnah in broad daylight and with no shame, imputing to them what they never said or intended. Saeed Foudah's deception can be clearly demonstrated by assuming his doctrine of <i>uncreated kalam nafsee</i> and <i>created <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee</i> and then imposing that understanding upon al-Tahawi's speech and seeing if al-Tahawi's speech can bear such meanings. In contrast, we can also see whether al-Tahawi's speech is perfectly in line with the refutations of the Salaf against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mut'azilah and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>. So let's start:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And that the (Arabic) Qur&#702;&#257;n is the speech (kal&#257;m) of All&#257;h.</blockquote>    <P>
Either <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is speaking about the <i>kalam nafsee</i> (upon Foudah's) doctrine, or he is speaking of the <i>created Qur'an</i> (<i>lafdhee</i>) or he is speaking of the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is the <i>kalam</i> of Allaah upon the definition of <i>kalam</i> known in the Arabic language and in fact in all nations that it is meaning and wording together. So there are only three options. So if he is speaking of the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> then the meaning of this sentence becomes "<i>And that the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah</i>" a redundant repetition, as this is simply saying, "<i>The <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah</i>". Or if he is speaking of the <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> (Foudah's created Qur'an) then the  meaning becomes, "<i>And the [created] kalam lafdhee is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah</i>." So you can start to see the idiocy and lunacy right from the very first sentence in that Foudah's <b>Mu'tazilee</b> creed becomes exposed by <u>the very first sentence</u> of Imaam al-Tahawi! Foudah would never make a career criminal in academic fraud. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> attributed the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as speech to Allaah, but only in the sense of created things attributed to Him, such as "<i>Allaah's House</i>", "<i>Allaah's Messenger</i>" and so on. As we proceed, you will realize the matter reduces down to <b>total agreement</b> between the Ash'aris and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality, whilst playing with words to make it look otherwise. Though some of the Ash'aris are a bit more honest. Read the frank admissions <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >here</a> (<b><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></b>), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> (<b><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></b>) and <a href=index2714.html?kiagk >here</a> (<b> al-Buti</b>). If however, we carry this first sentence upon the way understood by the Salaf, then al-Tahawi's speech stands and makes sense and agrees perfectly with historical record, that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we hear, recite and read is the actual speech of Allaah in both meaning and wording together, and all of it is uncreated (in meaning and wording), however the mediums of conveyance are created (voice of the reciter, ink and paper in the mus-haf), this is because information (knowledge) is independent of the means of conveyance. The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the knowledge of Allaah, He spoke this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and its meanings and wordings are independent of how they are conveyed amongst the creation (voice of the reciter, ink and paper in the mus-haf), but in whatever way they are conveyed, they remain the uncreated speech of Allaah, the Exalted, <b>since these words commenced from Him as His uncreated speech</b>. His speech is uncreated because His essence is uncreated. And our speech is created because our essences are created. And Allaah is eternally one who speaks <i>whenever He wills</i>. This is the belief of the Salaf as is clear from thousands of their statements. This is the creed <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is affirming.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It emerged, commenced from Him - without kaifiyyah - as speech (qawlan).</blockquote>    <P>
Pay attention here. The views amongst the Ash'aris are that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was expressed by Jibreel, or by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) or Allaah created it in the Preserved Tablet (hence the wording came directly from Allaah and is attribute to Him). Upon either of these three interpretations, al-Tahawi's statement would not make sense. Upon the view that it was expressed in wording first by Jibreel, then al-Tahawi's statement is invalidated as it would be clearly inaccurate and false. Upon the view that it was first expressed in wording by the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), al-Tahawi's statement is alsoo invalidated.  Upon the view that Allaah created the wording in the Preserved Tablet and from there it was taken by Jibreel who dictated it to the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), then here the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is invalidated too, since he should have said, "<i>It emerged, commenced from Him - without kaifiyyah - as something written [in the Preserved Tablet]</i>." However, <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> clearly stated "<i>qawl</i>" and he negated a "<i>kaifiyyah</i>" and this means that Allaah spoke it with actual speech whose reality is uknown to us (without <i>kaifiyyah</i>), only this interpretation and understanding can possibly be true. Whether, the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) or (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) is used is <i>irrelevant</i> at this stage (we shall look into this in detail when we analyze Saeed Foudah's commentary in detail in a separate article). This is because <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> clearly stated (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), "<i>as speech</i>" and upon the doctrines of the Ash'aris, it only started and appeared as speech with Jibreel (and in written form from the Preserved Tablet). So it is not possible to reconcile this speech of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> with the doctrine of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.     <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He sent it down to His Prophet as revelation (wahiy) and the believers accepted it as such in reality. And they had firm conviction that it was (indeed) the speech of All&#257;h, the Exalted in reality. </blockquote>    <P>
Either the uncreated <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> is intended here, which is impossible from numerous angles, because the Ash'aris say at the same time that this is a singular indivisible meaning in the self of Allaah. So either the entire <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> was sent down (all of Allaah's knowledge and speech) or a part of it  that relates to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was sent down, but the doctrine does not allow this, since the eternal meaning in the self of Allaah is not <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> to them. So clearly the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> cannot be intended here. Or the <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> is intended in which case the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> quoted above can actually bear this interpretation. So we will give that to <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a>. <b>But only upon the doctrine of the Mu'tazilah! The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is a created entity ascribed to Allaah metaphorically</b> Thus, upon Foudah's corrupt and futile doctrine it can be argued that al-Tahawi's statement reads that Allaah sent down the <i>created</i> manifestation of the meaning in His self which is in the Preserved Tablet, and that this created manifestation (<i>kalaam lafdhee</i>) is taken by the believers as the speech of Allaah from the angle that He determined and originated its wording in the Preserved Tablet. So from here it becomes clear that <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> is simply upon the doctrine of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of ascribing a <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> to Allaah metaphorically speaking. The only difference is that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was created "<i>laa fee mahall</i>" (in no space) and the Ash'aris say in the Preserved Tablet. Beyond this, what the Ash'aris say is "<i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>" the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> simply say is Allaah's wish (<i>iraadah</i>) and knowledge (<i>ilm</i>) which are both synonymous with His essence, indicating there is no real substantial difference between them. Read  <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >here</a> (<b><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></b>), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> (<b><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></b>) and <a href=index2714.html?kiagk >here</a> (<b> al-Buti</b>). <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Tahawi</font></a> then said (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1571;&#1610;&#1602;&#1606;&#1608;&#1575; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1602;&#1610;&#1602;&#1577;</span>), "<b>And they had firm conviction that it was (indeed) the speech of All&#257;h, the Exalted in reality</b>." This creates huge problems for the neo-Jahmites. Upon Foudah's doctrine, from the context, this can only be in relation to the <i>created <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee</i> (the Arabic Qur'an), so if its "<b>in reality</b>" (<i>bil-haqeeqah</i>) the speech of Allaah, all we have here would be an emphatic form of the Mu'tazilee doctrine that the speech Allaah creates in others (as speech in humans or as writing in tablets) can be ascribed to Him metaphorically speaking (<i>majaazan</i>). But this appears as a clear contradiction. <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Tahawi</font></a> says it is Allaah's speech in reality and what he means is what the Salaf meant. Yet the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'aris have to maintain it is Allaah's speech metaphorically (<i>majaazan</i>). So this is a contradiction. But this allows the Ash'aris in particular to say,   "<i>Yes it really is the speech of Allaan and it appeared from Him</i>." That's what they will say whilst concealing their belief that they hold it to be created, that it is something Allaah <i>created</i> in the Preserved Tablet</b>. So what we have in reality is the doctrine of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, clothed to appear otherwise. Some of them are frank and readily admit the conceptual agreement with the Mu'tazilah: Read  <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >here</a> (<b><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></b>), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> (<b><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></b>) and <a href=index2714.html?kiagk >here</a> (<b> al-Buti</b>). But Foudah is a serial con-man who has not got the guts to admit all of this.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It is not created like the speech of the created beings.</blockquote>    <P>
It's getting hotter and hotter and harder to breathe for <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a>, as their fraud starts to dissolve in the intensity of the heat in the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. Remember, <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> can only ever be speaking of either the <i>kalam nafsee</i> (uncreated) or <i>kalam lafdhee</i> (created) if we assume the doctrine of <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> to be correct. Now in this statement he simply cannot be speaking of the <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> as that is created according to Foudah and all intellectually defunct <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. So he must be speaking here in this sentence of the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>.

It is only possible to hear the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (<i>created <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee</i>) according to the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> doctrine, so this would show (if Foudah is correct) confusion and contradiction in al-Tahawi's speech if we assume he is propounding the same doctrine as <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> claims he is. In that case, in one sentence <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is speaking about the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>, then in the next sentence he quickly shifts to the <i>kalaam lafdhee</i>. This really is a revilement upon <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. What <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is speaking of here is the claim of Walid bin al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Muhammad (and not the speech of Allaah), intending by this that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) made up this speech and claimed it was from Allaah and that Allaah never spoke this speech. However, <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> tries to twist and distort this part of al-Tahawi's speech as we shall see later, when he claims that this means "<i>whoever claimed it is letter and <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, has disbelieved</i>" and this is a fabrication upon <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> just  as it is a fabrication against Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, as it relates to these verses which were revealed in connection to Waleed bin al-Mughirah. More on this in a separate article. <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Tahawi</font></a> continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>All&#257;h has rebuked him, censured him and promised him His punishment, when He said, "<b>I will roast him in Hellfire</b>" (74:26). Thus, when All&#257;h threatened the one who said, "<b>This is but the speech (qawl) of man</b>" (74:25), we come to know and have firm conviction that it is the speech (qawl) of the Creator of humanity, and it does not resemble the speech of man.</blockquote>    <P>
In other words, Walid bin al-Mughirah is promised with the Fire, and he was promised the Fire for stating the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech (qawl) of Muhammad and not the speech (qawl) of Allaah, the Exalted, and this establishes that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah. And it is not possible for Walid bin al-Mughirah to be referring to the <i>kalam nafsee</i>, rather it can only have been the <i>kalam lafdhee</i> (that he was hearing from the Messenger), and upon this it becomes clear the Saeed Foudah's doctrine and that of the As'haris as a whole is <b>identical</b> to that of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who said the speech Allaah creates can be ascribed to Him but not as an attribute of the self. This is exactly what Foudah and  all <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> believe but try to conceal it with deceptive words. They would have to read the above section of al-Tahawi's creed as follows: <i>That since Allaah promised the Fire for Walid bin al-Mughirah, it means that the created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (<i>kalam lafdhee</i>) cannot have originated with Muhammad but from Allaah, that Allaah is the one who created it (in the Preserved Tablet) and hence it is attributed to Him, not as an attribute (as that is only the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>) but in the same that we say "<i>Allaah's House</i>" and "<i>Allaah's Messenger</i>", exactly as the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say</i>. Read  <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >here</a> (<b><a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a></b>), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a> (<b><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></b>) and <a href=index2714.html?kiagk >here</a> (<b> al-Buti</b>). Remember, if we are speaking about a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is heard, it can only be the (created) <i>kalam lafdhee</i>, and hence al-Tahawi's speech, "...<i>we come to know and have firm conviction that it is the speech (qawl) of the Creator of humanity</i>..." can only mean, upon Foudah's doctrine, "...<i>the speech (qawl) <u>created</u> by the Creator of humanity</i>..." as in what He created in the Preserved Tablet of speech consisting of letters and words. To ascribe all of this to <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is a fabrication against <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>, a vicious slander against him and the attribution of the kufr of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. May Allah exonerate this Imaam from such slanders.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And we do not dispute about the Qur&#702;&#257;n. We testify that it is the speech (kal&#257;m) of the Lord of the Worlds.  The trustworthy spirit descended with it, and he taught it to the chief of the messengers, Muhammad (sallall&#257;hu alayhi wasallam).

It is impossible to maintain that all of this  passage is in relation to the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>. Since it would mean that Jibreel (alayhis salaam) descended with this <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>, and taught it to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). Since the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> maintain (in one of their views) that Jibreel took the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> only from <u>the Preserved Tablet</u>, then it is impossible to maintain this passage is about the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>. Rather, it has to be the <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> which they maintain is created, and this poses a problem in light of the very last sentence in the paragraph above (which interestingly <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> did not have any comment for). So upon this, it would be <u>as if</u> <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> is saying:    <P>
<blockquote>And we do not dispute about the (<u>created</u>) Qur&#702;&#257;n (kalam lafdhee). We testify that it is the (<u>created</u>) speech (kal&#257;m) of the Lord of the Worlds. The trustworthy spirit descended with it (from the Preserved Tablet in which it was <i>created</i> by Allaah), and he taught it to the chief of the messengers, Muhammad (sallall&#257;hu alayhi wasallam). It (the <u>created</u> <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee) is the speech of All&#257;h, the Exalted, nothing from the speech of created beings compares to it. <b>And we do not speak with [the doctrine] of the creation of the (<u>created</u>) Qur&#702;&#257;n (the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> lafdhee)</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
If you look at the last sentence, it is <u>a blatant contradiction</u>. And <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> would never be able to read out that statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> whilst keeping a straight face and without knowing in his soul that he is a liar in what he is professing, and without knowing in his soul that it is impossible to carry this paragraph upon the <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
In this article we illustrated the impossibility of imposing the   Jahmite <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> doctrine of <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> and <i>kalaam lafdhee</i> upon the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. <b>Not by any imaginitive gymnastic skill is it possible to maneuvre that doctrine of kufr into the speech of Imaam al-Tahawi</b>. This now sets the stage for us to look in more detail at Saeed Foudah's commentary and in particular the six main points that can be derived from his commentary on al-Tahawi's statements regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (they were listed in <a href=indexa2c8.html?ctuiuhq>Part 1</a> of this series).    <P>
