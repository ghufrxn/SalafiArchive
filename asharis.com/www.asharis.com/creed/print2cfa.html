<div class='sidebar'> <font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
First of all it is important to mention that where there are two opposing and warring factions, it is necessary to acknowledge and side with the one closest to the truth in its views, and no doubt that is the As'harites. For even if their theology is founded directly upon the proof of huduth al-ajsaam which they took entirely and wholly from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, yet in what they held to be the <u>lawaazim</u> (binding necessities following on from this proof) their misguidance was less and their departure from the truth was not like the departure of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
However, despite this, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, because of the particular position they held, in trying to find a middle way between Ahl al-Sunnah, the hadeeth and aathaar, and the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they took entirely from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which came from the Greek and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<a href=index2670.html?kagzi>see this article</a>), they manifested lots of incoherence, and in what they considered to be the defence of their particular theology, they showed <u>such contradiction</u> not found amongst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. This is because the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <u>remained true</u> to all the necessities (lawaazim) following on from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (just deny everything for Allaah, and claim this is Tawhid). However, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were forced to invent new ideas, or acquire doctrines in order to sustain their positions. Two prime examples are <i>al-arad laa yabqaa zamaanayn</i> (an incidental attribute does not last two instants of time) to enable the argument against the Mut'azilah to justify attributes for Allaah and <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> (the singular indivisible meaning in the self of Allaah) to enable the argument to justify affirming speech in such a way that does not render Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and rebut the argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> despite being more misguided in their views, were more sound, rational and coherent than the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, and we will illustrate this here briefly on the issue of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>. Again <u>this does not mean</u> that the truth is with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, it means that the argument and position of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> is flawed and is based upon baatil. A person may defend a position but with false arguments and dubious principles as a result of which they allow the opponents to find greater cause to revile that position which is being defended, and this <u>in a nutshell</u> is the essential lifestory of the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> theology.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Multiplicity of Attributes and the Singularity of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> [Nafsee]</font>    <P>
We need to provide the context and setting first.     <P>
<b><u>The <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah</u></b>    <P>
So recall that the bid'ah of <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (divestment of Allah's names, attributes and actions) entered the Ummah when al-Ja'd bin Dirham brought the necessities of the proof used by the Sabean star and idol worshipping pagan disbelievers, the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (argument for origination of bodies through the presence of attributes and actions in them). As a result of this he denied Allaah spoke to Moses and took Ibraaheem as a friend and denied Allaahs <a href='tags/sifaat-dhaatiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat dhaatiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> and sifat fi'liyyah. And this was taken from him by Jahm and so the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> denied every description for Allaah, names, attributes and actions, the whole lot, and they said "We are the true Monotheists." And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took this bid'ah from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and they were essentially on the same view except that fearing the scorn of the people, they pretended to affirm the names of Allaah outwardly, whilst denying them in reality, and so they said, "We are the true Monotheists." So <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to them tended towards the abstract notions of theism that were found in the language and writings of the Greek and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>. Thus, the language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> changed from affirming for Allaah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him into the language of negation (negative theology), which is "He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>,  nor a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, nor an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, nor in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, nor in makan, nor above, nor below, nor within the universe, nor outside the universe" and so on.    <P>
<b><u>Ibn Kullaab and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the Doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Nafsee</u></b>    <P>
Then came <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> who tried to debate the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> using <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and so they grilled his brain to a certain degree [remember the Imaams of the Salaf said that whoever entered into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> never came out unscathed, and he came out losing his intellect], and so here is the story:    <P>
<blockquote>The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> argued with him regarding <u>Allaah's speech and the Qur'an</u>, saying the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and likewise speech in general, has a beginning and an end, and it has succession, sequence, composition and so on, and so whatever is like this is not permitted to be from the essence of Allaah. So with this argument, they confused him, because he was debating with them upon the platform of ilm al-kalaam and he was not able to answer them with the Book and the Sunnah. So he found a way to answer it <u>by innovating the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee</u>, so he said that Allaah's speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is only a single, indivisible meaning present with Allaah, and hence your objections (i.e. of the Mu'tazilah) are invalid. Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> therefore does not have divisibility, sequence, composition, rather is a single eternal meaning. And as for the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, that is only a quotation (hikaayah) of that singular, eternal speech which is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>  nafsee. He had to agree with them that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is makhluq, <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> (created, originated) because it consists of letters, words - so he agreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against Ahl al-Sunnah in this matter, and this was the very matter that was raging for over a hundred years previously between the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Ahl al-Sunnah.     <P>
Having submitted to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> here, and to <u>remain consistent</u> here, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> also had to deny that Allah has actions tied to His will and power, because ultimately this is the issue that connects to the matter of speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the denial of Allah's chosen actions is the underlying foundation upon which the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qu'ran</font></a> is created is based upon. Once he adhered to this foundation (a foundation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> following on from the proof of huduth al-ajsaam), he was forced to remain consistent with it, not just in the issue of Allaah's speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, but all other similar issues. Hence, he took a certain orientation towards those attributes that are tied to Allah's will and power (<i>sifat fi'liyyah</i>, <i><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i>) such as love, anger, pleasure, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> and so on. So he simply treated some of these as <u>eternal attributes</u> (love, anger, pleasure) and as for the others he [utilized the Mu'tazili principle regarding the attributes (see below) of treating them as external to the self of Allaah] and explained them away by saying that they are acts external to Allah's essence (i.e. <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Istiwaa</font></a> is an act that takes place in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, it is not an act of Allaah Himself). So he followed the approach of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> in relation to the af'aal. However, with respect to all the other attributes like 'uluww, face, hands, eyes, the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>, he never had a problem with those, and he rebutted the  <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in those areas. They only confused him on what they were referring to as hawaadith (events, occurrences) by which they meant Allaah's chosen actions.     <P>
Now when <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <u>this was the creed that he adopted</u> and so he supported and defended this way for a while until he came into contact with some of people of hadith, like Zakariya al-Saji in Basrah. So as he started becoming more familiar with the way of the people of Hadith, Sunnah, and Athar, there was a transition in what he was upon until he explicitly stated that he adheres to everything that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> adhered to, and this is represented in his book al-Maqaalaat and al-Ibaanah.     <P>
Also note that neither <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and nor <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (after he left the Mu'tazilah) considered the proof of huduth al-ajsaam to be obligatory and for this reason they never fell into the doubts of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> fell into and for this reason you see them affirming strongly, Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> like face, hands, eyes and so on bila kayf and without <a href='tags/tawil.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'wil</font></a> and tafwid - in perfect agreement with Ahl al-Sunnah and vehemently refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on these topics. The later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> unfortunately opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, followed the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in laying down the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, declaring it obligatory, and thinking they could  support the general orientation and way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. Yet all they did was lay down the path that would <u>force</u> the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> thereafter to concur with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and their very early followers had affirmed. Today's <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have no connection at all to the early Kullabi Ash'aris, that connection cut off within 150 years after al-Ashari's death.</blockquote>    <P>
Now the point we are making here is related to <u>the issue of Allaah's attribute of kalaam</u>, so remember that to counterargue against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> adopted the doctrine of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, that of <u><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></u>.    <P>
<b><u>The Mu'tazilah</u></b>    <P>
You should also recall that to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <u>to affirm any other meaning or sense</u> in addition to Allaah's essence, and to ascribe it to the essence, <u>necessitates shirk</u>, because it means divisibility, composition, parts, in Allaah's essence, and multiple eternal entities. And so they argued against the  <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> from this angle. However, in sustaining this argument the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had  to deal with those texts that clearly affirm attributes for Allaah. So they had two ways. <u>The first</u> was to say the attribute is synonymous with Allaah's essence, so that knowledge (ilm), wish (iraadah), power (qudrah) and so on are all just synonymous with Allaah's essence. <u>The second</u> was to say that the attribute is what is external to Allah's essence but can be said to belong to Him, just like we say, "Allah's Messenger", "Allah's house", "Allaah's wealth", "Allaah's she-camel" and so on, and this was the view they took regarding the attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) as a result of which they said the Qur'aan is Allaah's speech, but His speech is what He creates in others besides Him and it can be said to be His speech but it is created. So you get the general idea now, and this now sets the scene for the battle.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Knocked Out the <a href="tags/asharites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'arites</font></a></font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bloxing-glove.gif align=right border=0>Now this is where it gets exciting and interesting, its the showdown, [its the Thrilla in Manila], so when the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> saw this doctrine of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> regarding Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, which they innovated to counter the argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were saying that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is <u>a single indivisible eternal meaning</u>, it is not two meanings, or five or ten or a thousand a million, but just one single indivisible eternal meaning, and it only becomes multiple meanings when it takes form as a created expression external to the self of Allaah, but as it exists with Allaah it is one singular indivisible meaning - when they saw this, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> tutted, put on those gloves and put them on tight, and when the bell rang they raced over and laced the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> good and proper, and so here it is, and we will play it for you - in all its glory - in slow motion:    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">Now listen up, what you call kalam (a meaning in the self) is nothing but Allaah's knowledge (ilm) [as it relates to whatever is a khabar (information) in the Qur'an] and wish (iraadah) [as it relates to whatever is a request (talab) in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, meaning a command or prohibition] [see here where al-Buti <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>makes it clear</a>] and we consider these attributes <u>synonymous</u> with the essence, they are nothing but Allaah's essence itself, and since you  tried to flee from affirming multiplicity for Allaah by claiming <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (as you see it, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee) is just a singular indivisible meaning in the essence [which in reality is just ilm and iraadah to us, which we consider synonymous with the essence], then why don't you just say that all the seven attributes you affirm are likewise just a single meaning, synonymous with the essence in order to avoid affirming multiplicity in Allaah's essence. Because if you have done it for Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech), in the sense you want to avoid affirming multiple instances or categorizations of speech in Allaah's essence which have different meanings and claim to hold that it is unified speech (ittihaad al-kalaam), then do it likewise for multiple attributes in His essence that have different meanings (like hearing, seeing, knowledge, wish, power, and life) and just say that they are either all synonymous with the essence (and not independent attributes of the essence) or they are all just one unified attribute and that this attribute is synonymous with Allaah's essence and not additional to the essence.     <P>
So either you agree completely with us <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the true Muwahhideen and become real men, or you agree completely with those Hashawi Mujassims [meaning Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah] and become real men, but don't stand in the middle as <u>emasculated, effeminate, sissified eunuchs</u>. </font></blockquote>    <P>
So with that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> socked them good and proper, and down they fell, flat on their noses.  Meanwhile al-Aamidee (d. 631H) is looking on, and he can't take it anymore, that's it, <u>he's had enough and he is throwing in the towel</u>! So here it is, here is his white towel, and it is found in his book <i>Abkaar al-Afkaar</i>  (tahqiq, Ahmad Muhammad al-Mahdi, Dar al-Kutub wal-Wathaa'iq al-Qawmiyyah, 2004, 2nd edition, 1/400):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/al-aamidee-abkaar-kalaam.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the truth is that this dubiosity that they brought against the saying of "the unison of speech" (ittihaad ul-kalaam, meaning "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is a singular indivisible meaning), and returning (i.e. explaining) the variation [pertaining to this "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" in its "expression"] to those things (ta'alluqaat, muta'allaqaat) [that are external to the self of Allaah], <b>then it is difficult, and perhaps it's solution might be with someone besides me</b>.    <P>
And due to the difficulty in answering this, <b>some of our associates fled to the saying that the speech of Allaah, the Most High, which is established with His Self is [actually] <u>five separate attributes</u></b>, which are: al-amr (command), an-nahee (prohibition), al-khabar (information), al-istikhbaar (inquiry), an-nidaa (calling out).</blockquote>    <P>
To help you grasp this, in the two pages earlier he mentions this argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> against them which is:     <P>
<blockquote>That the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech of Allaah), you admit it is of types, from it is that which is pure information (khabar), and from it is that which is command (amr) and from it is that which is prohibition (nahi), so straight away, <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> cannot be a singular meaning, by its very essence, it is of types. <u>The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> said</u>: No, this divisibility is not in the essence of [Allah's speech, <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee], rather it only applies in relation to those things it is connected and related to (ta'alluqaat, muta'allaqaat) that are external to the self of Allaah, and it only takes on these categorizations of being information, command and prohibition in the presence of those being addressed by it (the creation). <u>So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said</u>: Why do you not say the same with respect to the attributes  of Allaah you affirm, iraadah (wish), qudrah (power), knowledge (ilm), hearing (samee'), seeing (baseer) and so on, that these are all singular meaning, a singular attribute, synonymous with the essence, and they only take on their individual meanings in the presence of those to whom they relate to, the creation, (as abstract ta'alluqaat, muta'allaqaat). So al-Aamidee mentions the response of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and <u>he knows it is a weak response</u>, it does not really have any <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> and he knows it is not sustainable. This is why on the last paragraph on page 399, he says "<i>wa feehi nadhar</i>" (there is a problem with it), then he explains the flaw in it, and then we have the speech we quoted above where he is throwing the towel in, and saying that he can't answer this objection.     <P>
And then he says at the end of that quote that due to the difficulty in answering this objection, some of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <b>fled to the view</b> (!!) that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is not a single indivisible meaning in the self of Allaah, rather it is <b>five separate attributes in Allaah's essence</b> (!!), that it is command (amr), prohibition (nahi), information (khabar), inquiry (istikhbaar), and calling (nidaa). So in other words, the way that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> fled from this argument of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is that they no longer held <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> to be a singular, indivisible meaning that is not categorizable, rather it is five separate attributes in the essence of Allaah(!!). So having running on their heels from the debate after getting knocked out senseless, they changed their own doctrine so that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> could no longer raise that objection, because that was <u>a huge, huge flaw</u> that brings down their entire theology. Despite this, the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> is still central to them, they can not let go of that and so there remain amongst the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who are daring enough to say that Allah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is still the singular <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, indivisible in Allaah's essence, but it takes on different forms and categories when it is in its expressed [created, originated] form (in the form of revealed books), in the presence of the creation to whom it is addressed - whilst just hoping and wishing that no one's going to notice that they got walloped on this in times gone by and thinking they can get away with it, because others won't notice this matter! </blockquote>    <P>
Now since that time, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have been on high dosages of <u>paracetamol, codeine and steroids</u>, and they've not recovered since. Their polemics in order to hide this flaw are just window dressings and a mere mirage, and they do not have any answer of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> to this rationality, which indeed is the truth and shows the flaw in their contradictory position between fleeing from divisibility in Allaah's essence by negating divisibility in meaning in the attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, but then affirming multiplicity in meaning through their affirmation of multiple attributes in Allaah's essence. And this is why it used to be said by Yahyaa bin Ammaar:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">The <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Mu'tazilees were masculine (males) and the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> were feminine (females).</font></blockquote>    <P>
There could not have been a truer and more accurate characterization.    <P>
It is also for this reason that the As'harites at the beginning of the affair they discourage from "delving too deep" into aqidah, because they know from the outset a person of sound mind, and clear intelligence is not going to buy their nonsense. They have to first <u>shallow fry</u> his brain (through that condemned ilm al-kalaam), and once that has been completed, then the discouragement for "delving too deep into aqidah" is lifted, and in comes the <u>deep-fry</u> with the Jawharahs, the Umm al-Baraaheens, the Sharh al-Maqaasids and the likes, and now that brain goes from medium rare to charcoal - and its what the Salaf said about this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, that whoever entered into it, lost his aql.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes</font>    <P>
It is important to re-iterate again that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are more astray than the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> however, they were more rational and coherent in their falsehood than the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were in what they presumed to be the truth. And the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> did combat the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the field of al-Qadar and the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, but they did so using weak and flawed tools (ilm al-kalaam), and therefore did not do a proper and thorough job. And when you look into the writings and refutations of the people of Hadith, Sunnah and Aathar, you see such powerful refutations based upon a thorough and deep understanding of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, and powerful types of deduction of evidence that the opposers had no choice but to either reject the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> outright or submit to it wholeheartedly. As for ilm al-kalaam then its just a bunch of people bickering and fighting all night around a camp-fire until either the fire dies or dawn breaks and they've achieved nothing except being cold, worn and tired. And they will start bickering again the next night, because each one is trying to outwit the other with his reason (aql) as the foundation.    <P>
