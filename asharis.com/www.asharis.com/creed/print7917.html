<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is a continuation of a subject started in this article:  <b>A Reply to the Doubt of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> Regarding What is 'Muhdath' and What is 'Makhlooq' - Which Is The Very Doubt of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwaan</font></a> - And Their Attempt To Negate Allaah's Actions By Way Of It</b> - (<a href=index5bb7.html?ramab>read it here</a>).</div>    <P>
From the greatest of doubts of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> is that <u>Allaah does not have actions tied to His will (mashee'ah) and power (qudrah)</u> - and this denial is agreed upon by all factions and offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) and this denial is necessitated by what they made to be the foundation of their deen, which is their intellectual proof borne out of the notions of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> - see <a href=indexab1a.html?iowfm>here</a> and <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>here</a>.    <P>
And following on from this is what they are spreading regarding whether the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (which is from Allaah's Speech) '<i>came into existence after non-existence</i>'. And their intent behind this is to argue for the deen of <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> -  and whoever inherited it, or something from it, amongst the Mutakallimeen - <u>that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will and power</u> and this is the core underlying foundation behind the issue of the Qur'aan, and it is why they must say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (as we have it with us, recited, memorized, heard) is created.     <P>
So whilst making a fraudulent display of following the Salaf and claiming outwardly the "Qur'an is not created", these <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> hold secretly and inwardly, that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have, which we memorize and recite <u>and about which the Salaf unanimously said is uncreated</u>, <b>they (the Ash'aris) secretly hold <u>it is created (makhlooq)</u> and they admit that they are united with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this issue</b>, with their difference in reality being only one of wording and terminology. Go and read these three articles:    <P>
<ul><li><b>Imaam ul-Haramayn <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created - We Just Differ on a Matter of Wording Which Is On Account Of What Can We Call Allaah 'Mutakallim' (One Who Speaks) - (<a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>see here</a>)  <li><b>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti</b>: We (The Ash'aris) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are United that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Is Created And What the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Call 'Knowledge (al-Ilm)' and 'Will (al-Iraadah)', We Simply Call 'al-Kalaam an-Nafsee' - (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see here</a>)  <li><b>Fakhr ud-Deen <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the (Recited) <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created And Our Dispute Is One of Wording Only - (<a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>see here</a>)  <li><b>The <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of al-Bayjoori</b>: The Qur'aan We Memorize and Recite Is Makhlooq (Created) And Is From <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> - But We Only Say That In Private, Not Openly - (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
And alongside all of this, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and anyone affected by them, or with sympathies to them, or whose mind has been corrupted by them, in their deception come out and start raising such doubts as to whether the Salafis claim that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> came into existence after non-existence or not - their intent behind it all to reject Allaah having actions tied to His will and power.    <P>
And these people (such as the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, and his student trolls, as well as other breeds of 21st Century Jahmite) when you look at the limits of their knowledge and understanding and how they try to use some statements of the Salaf to argue for their Jahmee beliefs <u>when those very same statements are in fact regarding them and in takfeer of them</u>, you become astounded by the foolishness and level of ignorance of these people.     <P>
An example is what they have brought of statements from the Salaf regarding anyone who says the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>" - and this is the subject of this article. Their intent by this is to argue and fight for the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> <u>that Allah does not have actions tied to his will</u> and to defend what they  made the foundation of their religion, that false, corrupt, repugnant intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" - <a href=index4bd8.html?pilwa>see their four doors here</a> and <a href=indexf20d.html?hcxqe>the American Chestnut Tree here</a>. They take these statements hoping to deceive and confuse Ahl us-Sunnah, whilst in their souls <u>they know full well</u> that when the Salaf refer to the "<a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a>", they are referring to this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> whose words (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) we recite, memorize, hear, and that the Salaf held there is only one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, it is all the same no matter how it is found (memorized, recited, written) and they  made takfeer of anyone who said this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is "makhlooq" and the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> know that they hold (in private) this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created. So all of this is from their talbees (deception). Then they use statements from the Salaf which they wrongly try to apply to Allaah's actions which are tied to His will and power, when in reality those statements are in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who hold the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created - whether by saying "makhlooq" or the ambiguous word "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>".    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In a previous article, the issue of Allaah's actions tied to His will and power was discussed. <a href=index5bb7.html?ramab>It's a good idea to go and read that article in depth and to grasp the issues</a>. Also, <u>take careful note</u> in that article our discussion is regarding what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> intend by their speech regarding the terms "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>", "hadath", "hawaadith"  in relation to "<u>Allaah's actions tied to His will and power</u>". The discussion in that article <u>is not</u> regarding the Qur'aan. And in that article we mentioned examples of such actions of Allaah tied to His will and power, such as creating, pleasure, hearing, seeing, <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. The specific issue of the Qur'aan <u>branches off</u> from that discussion.</div>    <P>
In this article we will be developing this issue and addressing this specific doubt of theirs inshaa'Allaah, <u>we will lay down a lot of the foundations</u>, <u>build the context</u>, and gradually <u>ensnare and encircle the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> from all angles</u>, <u>take them prisoner</u>, force them back into that <u>ditch of Khurasaan</u>, from where their forefather originated, and then <u>leave it to the sayings of the Salaf to finish them off</u> - <u>by Allaah's permission and aid</u>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Setting the Scene ...</font>    <P>
So we have a lot of <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> running loose and trolling on the field, and they are creating havoc and confusion in different directions, its a field day and there's lots of fun. There's some "cherry-picking" going on and some play with words and definitions, and smugness is all around.    <P>
It is important then that we don't waste time in deciding <u>which pegs and stakes should be driven into the ground around them first</u> - we will just take the first stake at hand and as it comes and drive into the ground and eventually encircle them - and we can worry about the cosmetics later on - so don't worry if the order of the stakes doesn't make sense. We may put one in the far left of the field away from us, another one to the far right to towards us - so it might look a bit haphazard but eventually the encirclement will take place inshaa'Allaah - all gradually.     <P>
So in nor particular order:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Intellectual Proof - Always Remember the Intellectual Proof</font>    <P>
We have covered this extensively previously and it is necessary that in every issue discussion with the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> that you remember where they are coming from and where they are going towards. These <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Ash'aris thrive on the fact that most people do not know and understand what the bulk of their creed is based upon. It is based upon a rational proof devised by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H), and then taken up by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and later refined and formalized by one of the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Abu al-Hudhay al-Allaaf (d. 235H), and then later taken up by the Kullabis and Ash'aris, with a more refined version being outlined by al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (d. 403H). They made this corrupt, false proof to be the ultimate truth and made it the base for the bulk of their creed.     <P>
To the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> the universe is just a collection of events (hawaadith), and all the bodies (ajsaam) that make up the universe are events (hawaadith) because these bodies themselves have incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and states of being (akwaan) which render them to be events (hawaadith). And as this is the basic argument for demonstrating the existence of a creator, the creator in turn, must be declared free of whatevery they deem to be an events or occurrences (hawaadith). It is from this perspective that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> deny that Allaah speaks by His will and power, even though they affirm speech for Allaah in the form of their innovated doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>". So they affirm "speech" as an attribute of the essence, but not as an attribute tied to Allah's will and power, such that He speaks, when He wills, as He wills, however He wills. And all of Tawheed to these people is based around purifying Allaah of what they call "hawaadith" because they have used the very same rational for arguing against the atheists in proving a creator.    <P>

You see when you let the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari know that you know where he is coming from and where he is going towards, the ball game changes. The Jahmee is now on the back foot, and he knows that you know what he is about. The smugness disappears very quickly, and the scenario is one where you are standing over the Jahmee whilst he is in a ditch below you, and the Jahmee is thinking to himself, "Shucks, they're onto us!".     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Ikhtiyaariyyah (Allaah's Actions Tied To His Will) and the Position of Ahl us-Sunnah and the <a href="tags/mutakallimoon.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mutakallimoon</font></a></font>    <P>
We need to understand the issue of whether Allaah has actions tied to His will and power or not. And this is the crucial point of difference between the Salaf and the Metaphysicists - (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) - and the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> follows on from that.    <P>

Here, Allaah created him from dust and after that He said, "Be!", and so Allaah's saying "Be!" occurred after the creation of Adam from dust. So this is an instance of Allaah's speech in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which could not have occurred in eternity - as the Kullaabi Ash'aris say - because Aadam did not exist then, and neither did <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>. And it is upon this, that Ahl us-Sunnah say that Allaah's speech is tied to His will. Allaah spoke to Moses, "<b>Indeed I am your Lord, so remove your shoes</b>..." and Allaah says He will say to Hellfire "<b>Are you filled?</b>". So are these two instances of speech the same? No, they are said by Allaah whenever He wills. But the Kullaabi Ash'aris claim all of this was said in eternity - when there was no Aadam and no Hellfire.    <P>
So the difference here is that the Kullaabi Ash'aris say <u>the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is eternal (qadeem)</u> and this saying was the innovation of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240) - and what they mean by this is very different to what Ahl us-Sunnah say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from Allaah's knowledge, it is Allaah's knowledge, which is eternal and Allaah spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as and when He willed, so this is different to what is intended by the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is "qadeem" since they have an innovated definition for "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" -  and Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a>, when he sat in the circles of the Kullaabis, he blindly followed this saying. And they hold Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is <u>an attribute of the essence (sifah dhaatiyyah) only</u> and is not a sifah fi'liyyah, meaning it is not tied to his will and power. And this poses a huge problem for them, because it means - and refuge is from Allaah - that when Allaah spoke in eternity (according to them) with His <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>, "<b>Allaah has indeed heard the saying of she who disputes</b> ..." (Mujaadilah 58:1), it means Allaah is not telling the truth - because how can Allaah have already heard she who disputes when she who disputes is not even in existence yet? And likewise with the verse, "<b>Allaah has indeed heard the saying of those who said, "Indeed Allaah is poor and we are rich!</b>" (Aali Imraan 3:181) - was Allaah telling the truth in eternity, before those who said this were even created - because this is supposed to be the eternal meaning that resides with Allaah's self, and is not speech tied to Allaah's will and power, according to them. So when the Kullaabi Ash'aris deny that Allaah's speech is tied to His will, repugnant sayings and implications are necessitated by this.    <P>
And some used the word "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>" which occurs in the verse in Surah al-Anbiyaa (21:2) in reference to this particular meaning (i.e. <u>Allaah's speech is tied to His will, and He speaks whenever He wills</u>). However <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> did not like that - as the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were using <u>this verse</u> and the word "<u><a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a></u>" to argue that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (that we have which we memorize, recite and hear) is created. And for this reason <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> spoke against Daawud al-Asbahani who had this saying. And this saying also contains an ambiguity that allows for it to be said that Allaah became "one who speaks" (mutakallim) after not being "one who speaks" (mutakallim) - which is incorrect, since it implies Allaah acquired the attribute after not having it. Rather Allaah has always been "one who speaks", and in addition to that Allaah speaks when He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills and this is the creed of the Salaf. So because the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were using this verse that contains the word "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>" to argue that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and also because this word contains an ambiguity that allows for it to be said that Allaah became "one who speaks" (mutakallim) after not being "one who speaks" (mutakallim) <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and others spoke against its use, and it particular they scorned Dawud adh-Dhaahiree for using it.    <P>
So there is a difference between the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah that Allaah has always been described as "one who speaks" (mutakallim), and that He speaks when He wills, however He wills. And that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from the speech of Allaah, since Allaah's speech is more than just the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and Allaah spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> when He willed, and in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> there is mention of things that Allaah said and will say (such as on the Day of Judgement) - so none of this necessitates that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, and nor that Allaah became "one who speaks" after not being "one who speaks". So there is a difference between this and between what the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are upon, which is that Allaah does not have actions tied to His will, and Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) is only a meaning that is present with Allaah from eternity, and as for what we have of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, which we recite, memorize and hear, then it is a quotation (hikaayah) or an expression (ibaarah) and it is created, its letters and words are created and is not the speech of Allah, it is a created speech - and their opposition to the truth in this regard is manifest and clear.     <P>
But then they try to cover this up and play with words and definitions, all in order to argue for the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, that if Allah has actions tied to His will, it would mean He is subject to hawaadith (events, occurrences), and would therefore be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and therefore the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" against the Atheists goes out of the window, as it would mean Allaah himself is created, and the Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> are on the floor, in stitches, out of laughter, scorning us <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> - and we can't allow that - so instead we'll just allow the revealed texts to be accommodated by our intellectual proof and reject, distort, or explain away from them what goes against our intellectual proof, and thus Allaah's speech is only the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" and <a href='tags/allaahs-pleasure.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Pleasure</font></a> (<a href='tags/ridhaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ridhaa</font></a>) is merely His intent (iraadah) to reward, and His anger (<a href='tags/ghadab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ghadab</font></a>) is merely His intent (iraadah) to punish, and His <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascent over the Throne) is merely His domination and His <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (descent) is really the descent of His mercy and so on. So everything which implies "hawaadith" is figuratively explained away. Why? Because the proof that we (<a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>) devised through the language, terminology and classification of the atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is the ultimate truth and it is decisive and definitive over the revealed texts which are nothing but ambiguities giving the presumption of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> for the most part to the <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>dumb commoners</a>. </blockquote>    <P>

To them, "haadith" means "makhlooq" (created), and "qadeem" is the opposite of what they understand to be "haadith". And this is different to what is in the Book, the Sunnah and the language of the Arabs. And following on from this the word "<a href="tags/muhdath.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhdath</font></a>", this needs to be looked at in more depth, <u>and we will do that a little later inshaa'Allaah</u>, but this matter should be understood well, "qadeem" does not equal uncreated, otherwise why has Allaah referred to the withered date-stalk, and people, and the actions that emanate from people, and the sayings that emanate from people as "qadeem" - when these are all created things. And likewise, "haadith" does not equal created (makhlooq) either.     <P>
So here, with this stake in the ground, we have confiscated these toys from them, and reined them in with the Book and the Sunnah and the language of the Arabs, and all of a sudden, the smugness has disappeared.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Positions of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Their Offshoots Regarding the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font>    <P>
The second stake we are going to drive into the ground is to accurately characterize the view of all the factions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> so that we can see where these 21st Century Jahmees who are trolling on the field, where exactly they fit in.    <P>
Because Jahm argued against the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> (Indian Materialist Philosophers) that an entity having attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) and actions (af'aal) is proof of its "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" (meaning to him createdness), then he was unable to describe Allaah to them with what is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> otherwise that would have falsified his proof for a Creator.  Thus, he deemed his proof to be decisive and instead rejected all of what is in the revealed texts of Names, Attributes and Actions for Allaah. And it was out of the necessity of this rejection that <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>, tafweed and tahreef were born and this then became the overall concern in the deen of the Mutakallimeen. To protect from invalidation what they thought to be the ultimate truth - their corrupt and false proof for the existence of a creator.    <P>
And amongst the specific views necessitated by this intellectual proof was: To deny Allaah spoke to Moses as this would amount to a "haadithah" and necessitate Allaah is a created body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) subject to an "event". And also to claim that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is memorized and recited is created (makhlooq) and is not Allaah's speech - again for the same reason, to negate "<a href="tags/hudooth.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hudooth</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/jismiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jismiyyah</font></a>" from Allaah - otherwise this would falsify the proof against the atheists. Thereafter, the offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> inherited this saying, and we can summarize the sayings of the various factions:    <P>
<b>The Jahmiyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is that the Qur'aan is created, that Allah does not have the attribute of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) to begin with, and He is not "mutakallim", and they interpret "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" to mean something within the creation, separate from Allaah. So Allaah created the "Qur'aan" and He therafter called it "His Speech" in the same manner that it can be said, "Baytullaah" about the Ka'bah, and "Naaqqatullaah", the She-Camel of Allaah and so on.    <P>
<b>The Mu'tazilah</b>    <P>
And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took up this deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their view is the same of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that the Qur'aan is created with the only difference being that  Allaah created it in the self of Jibreel (alayhis salaam) and Jibreel expressed it in his own words, or that he simply "quoted" the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that was created in his self. And that the speech of Allaah can be created in different situations, so for example, with Moses, the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech) was created in the tree and so on.    <P>
<b>The Kullaabiyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the Kullabiyyah is that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created and it is a "<u>hikaayah</u>" (quotation, narrative) of the meaning (ma'naa) that exists with Allaah's self, and it is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is present with Allah's self as a meaning that is not created, and he was the first to innovate this saying, and the Ash'aris took this from him. And this saying of theirs is based upon the fact that they do not affirm attributes of Allaah that are tied to His will and power - so whilst they affirm "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" as an eternal attribute of the essence, they reject that it is also tied to Allaah's will and power - as this would invalidate their intellectual proof.    <P>
<b>The Ash'ariyyah</b>    <P>
And the saying of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> is the same as that of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> save that they say that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created and is an "<u>ibaarah</u>" (expression) of the meaning (ma'naa) that exists with Allaah's self, and it is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is present with Allah's self as a meaning that is not created.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>All of these factions are agreed that <u>this Qur'an</u> that is memorized, recited and heard is created and that Allaah did not speak the words in this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. They do not differ in this and as such <u>they are all Jahmiyyah</u> and the speech of the Salaf is applicable to all of them without exception, since they hold what the Salaf condemned of beliefs and statements regarding the issue of the Qur'aan - and this is manifest when one looks at the vast and abundant speech quoted from them in the books of aqeedah.    <P>
And the true and real difference between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the one hand and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> on the other - after their agreement that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have, which we recite and memorize is created - is on what basis can we then call Allaah "mutakallim (one who speaks), with <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech)". So the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> say it is permissible to say Allaah is "mutakallim" and has "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" on the basis that he creates it in others, its His creation but it can be attributed to him. And the Kullaabi Ash'aris reject this and say this is impossible, rather Allaah can be said to be "mutakallim" and have "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" on the basis that there is a "meaning (ma'naa)" present with Him, and this meaning is what is called "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>". This is readily admitted by the Imaams of the Ash'aris themselves, namely that their view is synonymous with that of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and that they only dispute about terminologies. See these articles: From the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of al-Bayjuri (d. 1276H), <a href=index7636.html?ajlfv >here</a>), from <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>here</a>, from <a href='tags/muhammad-saeed-ramadan-al-buti.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan al-Buti</font></a> (contemporary), <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>here</a>, from Imaam <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H), <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a>.
