<div class='sidebar'><blockquote> <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is upon the theology of <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>, those who adopted the conceptual tools and baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and used them to distort the Book of Allaah and deny (aspects of) the Prophetic Sunnah. This faction appeared in the early first century hijrah when al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought in the use of Aristotelian and neo-Platonic language to speak about theology. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took it from them, and then a series of sects appeared who took this same path, including the <u>Raafidee Hishaamiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u> and others. Amongst them were <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b> and amongst them were <b>Mu'attilah</b> and both (errant) ways are founded upon the same <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> which is a term that represents the philosophical baggage of the Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) who incorporated the metaphysical language and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in theological discussion and debate. Before reading this series of articles you must do some background research to be able to follow along. The recommended articles for study are <a href=index17f5.html?lxtuo>this article</a> (provides good historical background and context), <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a> (<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>), <a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>this series</a> (<b>Destroying the Allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and Tashbih Against Ahl al-Sunnah</b>) and <a href=index1d7c.html?qcsxk>Part 4</a>  and <a href=indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5</a> of a series dealing with the creation or eternity of the universe between the Mutakallimeen (Ahl al-Kalaam, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots) and the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (al-Farabi, Ibn Sina). The reader is also encouraged to study articles on this site through which it will become clear that todays Ash'aris do not follow Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah), but those later ones (<u><a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a></u>, <u>al-Qushayree</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u>, <u>al-Raazee</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a></u>) who came after him and, through their own input and influence, took <b>the early Kullaabi-Ash'ari creed</b> in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Soofiyyah, Gnostic illuminists, eventually merging <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> as was done by the later ones. The evidence for that is overwhelming and can be found in articles on this site.     <P>
<b>What is known as "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" today is not what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> died upon. Many of the smart and shrewd ones amongst todays <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (posing as Ash'aris) know this very well and hence, they describe "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" as a "<u>dynamic approach in theology</u>" and not necessarily a fixed set of doctrines (because of the presence of much conflict, contradiction and inconsistency that is inherent in the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school). This is just one example of the many frauds they perpetrate against innocent Muslims who simply want to know the creed brougth by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and believed by the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), which is in accord with the <i>fitrah</i> and which is devoid of the conceptual baggage of that heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (a cover label for "<i>philosophy</i>") which they entered into the Ummah, split the Muslims and brought trials and calamities upon them.</b>    <P>
As for <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>, an online biographical account states:    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/ibrahim-osi-efa.gif style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" align="right" border="1" border=0>Shaykh Ibrahim was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He was blessed with the opportunity to study several classical disciplines at the hands of some of the holders of the tradition such as Murabit al-Haj, al-Habib Umar b. Hafiz and Shaikh Hassan al-Hindi. Initially studying for three years in Syria and Mauritania, Ustaz Ibrahim was then blessed with the opportunity to spend over six years in the illuminated city of Tarim, Hadramaut where he studied under the qualified hands of teachers such as al-Habib Kazim al-Saqqaf, al-Habib Ali al-Jifri and al-Shaikh Umar Husain al-Khatib. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> was one of the founders of several Islamic initiatives including the Ibn Abbas Institute, Starlatch Press, Badr Language Institute and the Greensville Trust. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> currently resides in Liverpool, England with his wife and two children.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that the teachers of this man are <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, gnostic-illuminists, mystics and those calling to saint-worship - matters which <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was free and innocent of.     <P>
In this series of articles we are going to deconstruct the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> which is taught through his course entitled <b><a href='tags/micro-madrasa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Micro Madrasa</font></a></b>. Our aim in these articles is to allow the reader to see the clear difference between what the Righteous Salaf were upon and between what the Ash'aris and Maturidis inherited from <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. In the course of these articles many of the historical and academic frauds of those posing as "Ash'aris" today and the Maturidis will become clear by Allaah's permission.     <P>
Throughout this series we will refer to <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> and his theological family as <b>the Jahmiyyah</b>, since <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (and al-Ja'd bin Dirham) are the primary origin points for their theology, and the term "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" is really an umbrella term for all those factions who built their theology upon the conceptual baggage and terminology brought into the Ummah by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the first century hijrah.   </blockquote></div> <P>

<blockquote>  In  <b>Introducing Theology</b>, <u>the Ten Principles</u> (Year 1, Session 1), <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> introduces theology with a definition:    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>01.</b> Just as a person will not achieve the desired goal by worshipping Allaah through other than what He legislated and just like a person will not achieve the worldly pursuits through other than the ways and means that lead to their acquisition, then likewise the theology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> does not lead to the desired end, which is rationally proving Allaah's existence, the Prophethood of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Resurrection. The theology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> aims to establish these three affairs. However, the <u>tools and goods</u> being offered are flawed and defective and do not lead to the desired outcome, despite appearing to do so on the surface. This is why many of those who delved into it (al-Ghazali, al-Razi) for a lifetime only ended up utterly confused and bewildered at the end of their lives, and went through many different (often contradictory) phases or viewpoints. These tools and goods are the refuse of previous nations, the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, and the theology of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> from the Muslim nation is simply plagiarized from their theology (in terms of the underlying language). A quick survey of the language used by <b>the Sabeans</b>, <b>Philo Judeas of Alexandria</b> and <b>Augustine of Hippo</b> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>read this series</a>) will soon take you out of the cloud cuckoo land of today's <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> posing as Ash'aris and put you squarely into reality. In this first slide <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> aims to define this "theology" with a view to legitimizing it.    <P>
<b>02.</b> What the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> refer to as "<u>the science of theology</u>" and the ambiguous misleading terms such as "<b>Usul al-Din</b>" or "<b>Aqidah</b>" or "<b><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></b>" (misleading from the point of view of what they intend by them) are built upon a corrupt, false foundation which is demolished by the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Sunnah, and Ijmaa'. This foundation is that a person must be able to rationally prove the existence of a creator through long-winded philosophical kalam arguments, otherwise the very basis of his creed is in doubt. <b>The claim of this being the first obligation is written textually by the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> such as al-Qaadee Abd al-Jabbaar, Ibrahim al-Nadhaam, al-Zamakhsharee, and the Asha'ris such as <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, al-Baghdaadee, <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>, and likewise the Maturidis, Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, and Abu al-Mu'een al-Nasafi and others</b>. Some of them such as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) went as far as to negate the Islam of a person who did not enter into this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> to rationally prove his faith (<a href=index8c76.html?ublmv>see this article</a>). This is false and rejected in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> because belief in the creator is <i>fitriyy</i>, <i>dhurooriyy</i> (innate, necessary, every soul is born disposed to it, acknowledging it). All the Messengers that were sent appealed primarly to the <i>fitrah</i> (and not primary to <i>aql</i>, reason, even though appeal to reason is also made in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> but in a way other than that of the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the mutakallimeen). Refer to (14:10) and (30:30) and relevant exegesis. It is rejected in the Sunnah because the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Every child is born upon the fitrah</i>..." It is rejected by Ijmaa (consensus) because there is consensus on the fact that the first obligation upon a <i>mukallaf</i> (legally bound  person) is to affirm the shahaadatayn. Even those scholars - such as <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar who were attached to Hadeeth and Sunnah but who were influenced to one degree or another by approach of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or tafweed (because they lived and acquired knowledge in a time where Ash'arism had spread and become dominant), even they did not leave alone this false principle of the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (despite being affected by them in the matter of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed). <a href=index8c76.html?ublmv>In this article</a> you will see <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> refuting the Mutakallimeen (despite being affected by them) on this particular matter, and Ibn Hajar likewise (<a href=index2047.html?osliq>see this article</a>) demolishes this foundation by saying within his explanation of Kitab al-Eemaan in al-Fath (whilst refuting <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the Mutakallimeen):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And alongside this, then the saying of Allaah, the Most High, "<b>So set your face towards the upright religion, Allaah's fitrah (meaning Tawheed) to which He has made mankind to be inclined</b>..." (ar-Rum 30:30) and the hadeeth, "<i>Each child is born upon the fitrah (i.e. inclination to Allah's recognition and Tawheed)</i>..." <u>are very clear in rebutting this matter from its very foundation</u>.</blockquote>    <P>
Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) explains what is correct, in <i>Dar' ut-Ta'aarud</i> (8/6-10):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) did not call anyone to contemplation (over the creation for deduction of proof for Allah's existence) and nor to the mere affirmation of a creator. Rather, the first thing he called them to was <b>the two testimonials (of faith)</b> and this is what he commanded the Companions.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>03.</b> To understand and put Scholars like <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> into perspective and grasp how they are deceptively used and placed into the first layer of the cake of deception of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in order to call people to their theology based upon the heretical (philosophical) <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> they made to be the foundation of Islaam, read the following articles:   "<b>The Levels and Ranks of Ash'arism or Those To Whom It is Ascribed</b>" (<a href=index2046.html?cmwje>read here</a>), and the relevant paragraph in "<b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a>) Against Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah</b>: Part 1" (<a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>read here</a>).    <P>
<b>04.</b>  Upon the false premise that the first obligation is <i>al-nadhr wal-istidlaal</i> (investigative study into proof of the universe being originated), the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> (of the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> condemned by the Salaf) elaborated upon a proof known as "<i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>" that has flawed, corrupt principles underlying it. These flawed corrupt principles allowed the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who believed in the eternity of matter to assault the theology of the Mutakallimeen (Ash'aris, Maturidis) when they saw the weakness in them, and this led to centuries of battle and debate and also saw utter confusion and bewilderment amongst the greatest of their scholars, such as <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H). When <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is defining "theology" for you here in this first slide, this is what he is drawing you into. A worn-out, outdated, flawed kalam theology that does not attain the objective. Rather, it was and continues to be pounded by the atheists and <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> today and it only causes those  who delve into it to inherit doubt. Be sure that eventually, it leads only to one of two things: <b><u>a)</u></b> the admission that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> argument proves the opposite, that the universe is eternal and there was no actual <u>act</u> of creation that took place which can be ascribed to Allah the Exalted as His act, ascribed to His essence (since the very nature of the proof requires this negation), or <b><u>b)</u></b> insist on the validity of this proof and affirm the universe was originated by a cause which you must then define <b>only in terms of the philosophical, metaphysical, conceptual terminology you used to argue for it in the first place</b>, in which case you will be gravitating towards an Aristotelian deity (immaterial, changeless, timeless, unembodied "mind" or "intellect") and then you will start assualting the reveled texts to  make them agree with this language, veiling that assault under the deceptive slogans of "<i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>", "<i>tafweed</i>" and "<i>tanzeeh</i>."      <P>

This unmoved mover is, "<i>eternal, unmovable and separate from sensible things</i>" (meaning cannot be perceived with the senses, and this is what <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought into the Ummah), and he also says, "<i>God is separate from sensible things because God has no magnitude (megethos), God is without a body or a spatial existence. The reason that God can have no magnitude is that God produces motion through infinite time, which means that God must be infinite, since an infinite effect requires an infinite cause; but there cannot be such a thing as an infinitude magnitude. As being a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> without magnitude, God is without parts and, therefore, indivisible (magnitudes are divisible)</i>", and here in the next statement we see the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, where in <i>Metaphysics 12</i>, we read "<i>the primary essence has no matter, which means that there can only be one God, since it is matter that differentiates one form or definition into many manifestations of that one form or definition.  Since God has no matter, then God is one not only formally or in definition, but also numerically</i>" and here is something else which is a parallel to the theology of the Mutakallimin, straight from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, "<i>It has been shown also that this primary essence cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible. But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of place</i>." This last statement alludes to what the Mutakallimin are upon of denying what they call hawaadith for Allaah, the denial of those matters tied to Allaah's will and choice which they call "events" and "changes" but which to Ahl al-Sunnah are Allaah's chosen actions (<a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>).    <P>
<b>06.</b> Now, once you have grasped the above, the rest of this series will make total sense to you when we deconstruct the theology of <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>. You will immediately recognize and see what is behind the claims of <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> with respect to theology and you will see that his creed is founded upon the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and the "<u>negative theology</u>" that is fundamental to it (negating Aristotle's <i>Ten Categories</i> from Allaah), and you will see how this <u>Aristotelian Tawhid</u> clashes with <b>the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers</b>, the <b>affirmative theology</b> in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and in the Sunnah of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). You will see the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> permeating the speech of <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> when he presents the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi views on Allaah's <i><a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a></i>, Allaah's <i>ru'yah</i>, Allaah's speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. You will see the intoxicated mind of <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>, intoxicated with that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> that leaves him and whoever is poisoned by him in <u>a drunken stupor</u> that is hardly recognized (by the uninformed and unaware) since <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> of the mind and intellect through <u>false, corrupt conceptions and ideas</u> is a hundred times more subtle than the <a href='tags/intoxication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Intoxication</font></a> of the body through <u>liquids, vapours and chemicals</u> - please visit our support group, <b><a href='tags/aristotelians-anonymous.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelians Anonymous</font></a></b> (<a href=series/aristotelians-anonymous---detox-and-support-program.html>here</a>) to learn more about this <a href=index6f5c.html?brner><a href="tags/intoxication.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Intoxication</font></a></a>.    <P>
<b>07.</b> When the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots (from whom <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is descended) made this to be <u>the foundation of their religion</u> and they wrongly thought that merely affirming a creator and proving a creator on rational grounds enters one into the ranks of the Muwahhideen, and that this is the desired Tawheed, they had laid down the foundations of great misguidance in the Ummah and they opened the way for the shirk that the Messengers came to warn against and all the doubts associated with it to justify it. This is because their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> does not go beyond the affirmation of creator - a matter which is <i>fitriyy</i>, <i>dhurooriy</i>, as has preceded. As a result, they erred in defining "<i>ilaah</i>" and they erred in defining the meaning of "<i>laa ilaaha illallaah</i>" and claimed it means "<i>al-qaadiru ala al-ikhtiraa'</i>", one who has power to invent, create. But this is not the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers. So their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> became a philosophical <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, spoken of, debated and argued for on the basis of metaphysical language that originates with <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the languages of bodies (ajsaam, jawaahir) and accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) - and it is on the basis of this language they distorted the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in the name of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>.    <P>
We shall take up Ibrahim Osi-Efa's definition of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in the next article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
