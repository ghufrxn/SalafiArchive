<p>In his lecture on <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> one amongst the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of Philadelphia said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... this was not the methodology of the early Hanbalee scholars and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaahu ta'aalaa) himself. So this needs to be kept in mind, so I'm saying, I'm mentioning it like this because <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (rahimahullaahu ta'aalaa) was the first, he was the first of this madhhab and he was the first from whom it was popularised. And these scholars, these were the Ahl ul-Hadeeth, the People of the Hadeeth, and that name says it all. If anybody in Philly, says that they are from Ahl ul-Hadeeth, yet they add to the hadeeth what is not from the  hadeeth, you tell them akhee, you cannot be from Ahl ul-Hadeeth if your are adding to the hadeeth what the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) didn't say in the hadeeth. Stick to that name, if you want to take that name for yourself (i.e. Ahl ul-Hadeeth), stick to that name and don't go outside of it. Say what the hadeeth says and be silent. Don't say, "bi hadd", with a bound... don't say with a boundary, because it did not come in a hadeeth or in an athar. It did not come from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) ... </blockquote>    <P>
He is saying that the madhhab of Ahl ul-Hadeeth was a very simple madhhab, a very simple creed, and that the people of this madhhab simple affirmed the texts and passed them on without comment or explanation. And broadly speaking, in the very early times, this is correct, because the people of Hadeeth were addressing those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who began to explain away what was in the Book and the Sunnah, so they said affirm what is in the Book and the Sunnah, speak with the narrations and pass them on exactly as they have come. And it was understood by all the Muslims and all the Scholars, that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and that He is described with Names and Attributes, and that these Names and Attributes have meanings that are known, and by which the Servants know and love their Lord, but the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were interpreting them and denying them and explaining them away and so we see the expressions from the Salaf, "<i>Affirm the narrations and pass them on as they have come</i>".     <P>
When the Salaf recognized and understood what was being intended by the Deniers, they stood to explain and clarify the clear meanings of the texts so that the Muslims are not deceived. And so in this regard, and as an example of that we see that:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abdullaah Ibn al-Mubaarak And <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> Refute What Was Being Spread By The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> By Explaining that Allaah Is Distinct And Separate From The Creation By Using The Explanatory Phrase "Bi Haddin"</font>    <P>
In the Tabaqaat ul-Hanaabilah of Ibn Abee Ya'laa there occurs (1/267):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/imaamahmad-ibnalmubaarak-hadd.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muhammad bin Ibraaheem al-Qaysee said: I said to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal: It is quoted from Ibn al-Mubaarak that it was said to him: How do we know our Lord - the Mighty and Majestic? He said, "Above (fee) the heaven, upon ('alaa) His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with a hadd (limit, demarcation)." So Ahmad said, "This is how it is with us". </blockquote>    <P>
<ul><li> Ad-Daarimee reported it in 'ar-Radd 'alal-Mareesee' (p.34)   <li> And also in his 'ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah (162)   <li> 'Abdullaah bin Ahmad in 'as-Sunnah' (1/175)   <li> al-Bayhaqee in 'al-Asmaa was-Sifaat' (p.427) from the route of 'Alee bin al-Hasan bin Shaqeeq who said, "I asked 'Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak, I said, 'How do we know our Lord?' He replied, 'Above (fee) the seventh heaven, upon His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.' I said, 'But the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say He is like this!' He replied, 'We do not say as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say, we say He is as He is.' I said, 'With a limit (bi  haddin)?' He replied, 'Yes, by Allaah, with a limit (bi haddin).'"  <li> And Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> said in 'al-'Uluww' (p.152 of its 'Mukhtasir'), "<b>This is saheeh (authentic) from Ibn al-Mubaarak and Ahmad, may Allaah be pleased with him</b>."   <li>And Shaikh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in 'al-Hamawiyyah' (5/184 of Majmoo' ul-Fataawaa), "<b>This is well-known from Ibn al-Mubaarak, established from him from more than one aspect and it is also affirmed from Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin Raahawaih and from more than one of the Imaams</b>."</ul>    <P>
When we see this Philadelphian <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari abusing and reviling those whom he claims say that Allaah <u>has the attribute</u> of "<a href="tags/al-hadd.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-hadd</font></a>" -  which no one from the Salaf said, and which Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> <a href=index91e1.html?voloh>did not say</a> - then you should know that he is in fact speaking about <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and <a href='tags/abdullaah-ibn-al-mubaarak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah Ibn al-Mubaarak</font></a> because they are the ones who used the phrase "bi haddin" and what they meant by it was that Allaah is separate and distinct from the creation, being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who were saying that He is in the creation. So this expression was used as an explanatory phrase to simply clarify - within this particular context - what is already in the Book and the Sunnah, which is that Allaah is separate and distinct from the creation, and ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.    <P>
And <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> has affirmed that this is what the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah indicate and what the Salaf held - <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>see here</a>.    <P>
So this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari and his likes, their problem is not really with Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, it is in fact with the generality of the Salaf in whose abundant works and statements there is a tremendous refutation of what this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari and his likes are upon. And for this reason you will see them mentioning only <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and Abu Mansoor al-Maatureedee as worthy of being followed in a specific sense, claiming that the true and real creed, in all its detail, was only exemplified and transmitted through them and that the rest of the Salaf of their time and prior to their time merely had a "simplistic" creed and a "simplistic" madhhab - in essence implying that they never really understood or grasped what they were transmitting and it was really only al-Matureedee and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> who truly understood.    <P>
