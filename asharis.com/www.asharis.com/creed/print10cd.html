<div class="articleContent">






<p>The Shaykh, Bakr Ibn Abdullaah Abu Zaid, rahimahullaah said (as quoted in the book "Kutub Hadhdhara Minhaa al-Ulamaa",  2/309):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> in his religion, his piety and manners is far above the likes of this treatise whose expressions call to the nullification of all of these [noble traits of adh-Dhahabee].    <P>
And Muhammad Ibn Ibraaheem ash-Shaybaanee has compiled a treatise entitled, 'At-Tawdeeh al-Jalee fi radd 'alaa an-Naseehati adh-Dhahabeeyah al-Manhoolati 'alaa al-Imaam adh-Dhahabee' in which he nullifies [with evidence] the ascription of this treatise to Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a>. And from that which it contains is:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I say: The ascription of this treatise to Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> is not correct for a number of reasons:     <P>
<b>Firstly:</b> That this treatise has not been mentioned by anyone who gave attention to the works of <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> (rahimahullaah).    <P>
<b>Secondly:</b> <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> was a student [of Ibn Taymiyyah] and his close companionship with Shaikh <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> was prolonged, even until the last days of his (Ibn Taymiyyah's) life, until his death (rahimahullaah).    <P>
<b>Thirdly:</b> All of the statements of <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> in his established and dependable books and likewise in his well-known and well-spread statements in praise of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and friendliness with him demolishes this treatise and shows the falsehood of its ascription to <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> - rather it is a fabrication upon him.    <P>
<b>Fourthly:</b> This treatise is written in the handwriting of a staunch opponent of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> [and not in the handwriting of adh-Dhahabee] who casts aspersions with empty speech. And this witness [of Ibn Qaadee Shubhah], therefore, is rejected according to legislative (principles)    <P>
<b>Fifthly:</b> Until this time we have not seen any acceptable, reliable evidence of its veracity that connects the authenticity of its ascription to him. And before one can do that, one must strip the thorny plant of its leaves (i.e. something that is impossible to do).    <P>
<b>Sixthly:</b> We do not see anyone who has ascribed it to <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> (rahimahullaah), after Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah except his contemporary al-Haafidh as-Sakhaawee (rahimahullaah), and in the time in which he did not mention any support for its veracity, we do not doubt that his dependence upon this manuscript passed beyond his time, and is from the misleading of his contemporary, Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah. And they [both] have a union in orientation that is opposed to the da'wah of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah).    <P>
<b>Seventhly:</b> As for the contemporaries who affirm its ascription to <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> then they are between a man who is united with Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah in madhhab and orientation, or another [man] that does not bring any evidence. And  how can there be acceptance of a saying that is devoid of evidence?    <P>
<b>Eighthly:</b> [This type of] harshness [in the claimed "Naseehah"] is not befitting towards the people of knowledge, and from them is Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a>, with his Shaikh, the Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. </blockquote>    <P>
</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> There is doubt as to whether this manuscript is in the handwriting of Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah. See <a href=indexcc05.html?fvqga>this article for more details</a>. <P>
