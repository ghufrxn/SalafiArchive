<img src=assets/images/ghunyah-jilani-cover.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=5 border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah al-<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
In previous articles we explained how the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> believe in secret that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we recite and memorize is just an "<i>ibaarah (expression)</i>" of <u>the second <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> they believe in</u> (which is just a meaning present with Allaah's Self), and that this ibaarah is created (<a href=index7636.html?ajlfv >but they forbid that this should be said openly</a>) as is explicitly stated in <u>al-Bayjuri's Haashiyah</u> upon al-Jawharah (one of their standard and most famous textbooks). Then there was the saying of <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) that the As'haris and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are actually agreed that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is created, but they just differ on issues of wording and terminology (<a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg >see here</a>). Then there is the saying of the contemporary Ash'ari, <u><a href='tags/muhammad-saeed-ramadan-al-buti.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan al-Buti</font></a></u> - and we brought his saying establishing the same (<a href=index2714.html?kiagk>see this article</a>). And likewise the saying of <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u> (d. 478H) confirming they are in agreement with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created (<a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>in this article</a>), and then another article on another section in <u>al-Bayjuri's Haashiyah</u> confirming that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is recited (maqroo') is created (<a href=indexf452.html?bxzbp >see this article</a>).     <P>
<b>All of this is based upon their doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> that <u>they stole and plagiarized</u> from the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and whose beginnings lay in the schemes and plots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> in their saying that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have is only a "<u>hikaayah</u>"</b> - see <u>Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee</u> (d. 258H), the Shaykh of <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> and Muslim <a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>speak about those zindeeqs in this article here</a>, and see <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H) discuss the roots and origins of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> in the doctrines of the conniving <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> <a href=index681f.html?xbxok >in this article here</a>.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/krakatoa.gif border=1 align=right hspace=6 border=0> We also brought a quote from the Mufassir, <u><a href='tags/ibn-jareer-at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jareer <a href="tags/at-tabari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Tabari</font></a></font></a></u> (d. 310) <a href=index171b.html?xyfnr >in which he cleaned out the rat-holes and secret hideouts</a> of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in a single sweep, <a href=index171b.html?xyfnr >cursing them, reviling them and making takfeer of them</a> on account of their claiming the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (that we read, recite, memorize and hear) is created - may Allaah have mercy upon him. And all of the above, sent them fleeing on their heels, full of awe and terror, with their intellectual frauds and innermost secrets brought out into the open and pounded with fire and brimstones - with not a whisper or whimper in response.    <P>
In addition to all of that we brought the takfeer made by Shaykh Abdul-Qadir al-Jilaanee (d. 561H) of those who say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is merely a created "ibaarah" (expression). In fact he spoke with very severe words, <a href=indexdf0c.html?quran>which you can read in full in this article here</a> (and you must take caution because there are lots of fireworks going off in every direction in that article!).    <P>
We want to now bring some more speech from Shaykh <a href='tags/abdul-qadir-al-jeelaanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdul-Qadir al-Jeelaanee</font></a> on the subject and it is something he says within the same section we quoted from previously in the book "al-Ghunyah".    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Abdul-Qadir: Whoever Says the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an Ibaarah (Expression) is Threatened with the Saqar (Hellfire)</font>    <P>
He says in "al-Ghunyah Li Taalibee Tareeq il-Haqq" (Daar ul-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, 1997, 1/128-129):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ghunyah-jilani-quran-saqar.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And Allaah, the Exalted, had threatened al-Waleed bin al-Mugheerah al-Makhzoomee, when he called the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> "the speech of man" - with the Saqar:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Then he (al-Waleed bin al-Mugheerah) said: "This is nothing but magic from that of old. This is nothing but the word of a human being!" I [Allaah] will cast him into Hell-fire. (Al-Muddaththir 74:24-26). </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Thus, everyone who said: "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an expression (ibaarah)</i>", or that "<i>it is created</i>", or that "<i>my pronunciation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>", then the Hellfire is for him just as it is for al-Waleed, unless he repents.</blockquote>    <P>
This follows on from the previous statement that was the subject of another article (<a href=indexdf0c.html?quran>see here</a>). Just for the record, and for history and posterity, its worthwhile doing:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Slow-Motion Replay</font>    <P>
We're just going to replay the last part of the statement which is of significance to us here:    <P>
<u>Play:</u>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">Thus, everyone who said: "<i>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is an expression (ibaarah)...</i></font></blockquote>    <P>
<u>Pause:</u>    <P>
Such as is the standard doctrine of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in all their textbooks, from al-Baqillani's (d. 403H) "at-Tamheed" and "al-Insaaf", al-Bagdhadi's (d. 429H) "Usool ud-Deen", al-Juwaynee's (d. 478H) "al-Irshaad" and through to all the books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, those of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H), <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H), al-Aamidee (d. 631H), al-Eejee (d. 756H) right through until this day of ours - their doctrine is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us is only <u>a created expression (ibaarah)</u> of the meaning that is present with Allaah's self. Thereafter, they used a variety of trickery and deception in wording to conceal the reality of their saying to protect themselves from the scorn of all people with sound fitrah - plays with words and definitions that were not hidden to the Scholars of the Sunnah, and to the likes of Shaykh <a href='tags/abdul-qadir-al-jeelaanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdul-Qadir al-Jeelaanee</font></a> - and certainly not to the early Salaf like the Shaykh of <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> and Muslim, Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee who spoke regarding those <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Lafdhiyy Zindeeqs with whom the claim of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us being a "hikaayah" (quotation) first originated - <a href=index67ca.html?sxinm>see that here</a>.    <P>
<u>Play:</u>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">... or that "<i>it is created</i>", or that "<i>my pronunciation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>" ...</font></blockquote>    <P>
<u>Pause:</u>    <P>
As is taught in all Ash'arite institutions and centers across the world, through the likes of books such as al-Bayjuri's <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> upon Jawharat ut-Tawheed and in which there is explicit mention that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is al-lafdh al-maqroo' (the recited word) is created, and that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is superior to the recited word (al-lafdh al-maqroo') because he is the best of all creation (meaning the recited word is created), and repeating that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is recited is created on at least three occasions - <a href=indexf452.html?bxzbp>see this article here</a>, where we find the following three quotes from this standard Ash'arite texbook (p. 161):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjuri-quran-better-or-prophet.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with the meaning of the wording that is recited more excellent? Or is our leader, Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [more excellent]. Some of them have held on to what has been reported [that]: "<i>Every letter is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad</i>". However it's [authenticity] is not verified as established. <b>And the truth is that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent because he is more excellent than every created thing (makhlooq)</b>, as is taken from the speech (i.e. commentary) of al-Jalaal al-Mahallee upon the Burdah. And what supports this is that it (the Qur'an) is the action of the reciter and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent than the reciter and all of his actions. But it is safer to withhold from the likes of this, for the mind being devoid of this does not harm it. End summarized quote from the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of the Shaykh, al-Ameer.</blockquote>    <P>
And al-Bayjuri says in another place (p. 162):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth-2.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the outcome (of this discussion) is that every apparent [text] from the Book and the Sunnah that indicates [its] <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> [meaning "created", to them the Mutakallimoon] then it is to be carried to [be in reference] to <u>the wording [lafdh] that is recited (al-lafdh al-maqroo')</u> and not the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsi</font></a> (meaning residing eternally with Allaah's Self]. However it is prohibited for it to be said, "The Qur'aan is created", <u>except in the situation of teaching</u>, as has been said.</blockquote>    <P>
And a couple of pages eary al-Bayjoori's said (p. 160), leaving no room for any doubt:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the madhhab of Ahl us-Sunnah is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, with the meaning of al-Kalaam an-Nafsi [the meaning that resides eternally with the Self of Allaah] is not created. <b>And as for the Qur'aan with the meaning of <u>the lafdh (the wording) that we recite</u>, then it is created</b>. However, it is prohibited that it be said, "The Qur'aan is created" intending by that the wording which we recite - <b>except in the context of teaching</b>. Because it may give the presumption that the Qur'aan, with the meaning of His The Most High's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (i.e. that which resides in the Self) is created. And for this reason, the scholars withheld from speaking with the Qur'aan [being] created.</blockquote>    <P>
In all of these quotes you can clearly see that to the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> <u>it is that which is maqroo' (what is recited) that is created</u>. And this is none other than the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> and you can learn about this species in our article:    <P>
<ul><li>The Six Stages In The Evolution Of the Doctrines of the 'Qur'an Creationists' - The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> - <a href=index30fa.html?fsffi>read article here</a>. </ul>    <P>
And you should also note that the book we have quoted from is one that makes tahqeeq (corroborating what is correct) of that which is in the madhhab - so it means that the book provides the actual, standard Ash'arite doctrines that they hold as their religion before Allaah.    <P>
<u>Play:</u>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">... then the Hellfire is for him just as it is for al-Waleed, unless he repents.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<u>End:</u>    <P>
And this is what is said by Imaam at-Tahawi in his creed regarding those who claim that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, in our presence, in letter and word, is created:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1605;&#1606; &#1587;&#1605;&#1593;&#1607; &#1601;&#1586;&#1593;&#1605; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585; &#1601;&#1602;&#1583; &#1603;&#1601;&#1585;&#1548; &#1608;&#1602;&#1583; &#1584;&#1605;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1593;&#1575;&#1576;&#1607; &#1548; &#1608;&#1571;&#1608;&#1593;&#1583;&#1607; &#1576;&#1587;&#1602;&#1585;&#1548; &#1581;&#1610;&#1579; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#8207;:&#8207; &#8207;(&#8207; &#1587;&#1571;&#1589;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1587;&#1602;&#1585; &#8207;)&#8207; &#1548; &#1601;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575; &#1571;&#1608;&#1593;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1576;&#1587;&#1602;&#1585; &#1604;&#1605;&#1606; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#8207;:&#8207; &#8207;(&#8207; &#1573;&#1606; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1573;&#1604;&#1575; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585; &#8207;)&#8207; &#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1575; &#1608;&#1571;&#1610;&#1602;&#1606;&#1575; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585; &#1548; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1588;&#1576;&#1607; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585;</div>    <P>
Which translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So whoever hears it (the Qur'an) and claims that it is the speech of man, he has disbelieved. And Allaah has rebuked and censured him, and has promised him with the Hellfire, when the Most High said: "<b>I will cast him into Hell-fire</b>" (Al-Muddaththir 74:24-26). So when Allaah promised the Hellfire for the one who said, "<b>This is nothing but the word of a human being!</b>", we know and are certain that it is the saying (qawl) of the creator of man, and [that] it does not resemble the saying of man.</blockquote>    <P>
And this verse is also used by the Salaf in general against those who held the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created. Save that it should be pointed out that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> differ as to where the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> originated (in the letter and word we have with us) so some of them say it was created in the Preserved Tablet and others say it was created in Jibreel (after the singular indivisible meaning was inspired to him!) and others say it was created in the speech of Muhammad (alayhis salaam).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In any case, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are in agreement with al-Waleed bin al-Mugheerah (and with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah), that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, present with us, in letter and word, <u>is created</u>, since the saying of al-Waleed that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the saying of a man amounts to the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, and this is what the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon regarding this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word. And this is present in their books. However, seeing that all people will scorn them for this repugnant kufr, they have a variety of methods and techniques in concealing, hiding, camouflaging, obfuscating the reality of their view and making it appear as if it is the saying of the Salaf - if they have not just copped out and said, "<i>Hey, we just say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah (meaning his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> nafsee) and it is uncreated and we don't want to cause splits by going any deeper than this</i>". However, when they get together in their institutions, colleges, mosques and private gatherings, they preach the kufr that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word, is created,  which is the doctrine that is present in the standard textbooks from which they teach their creed, such as the <a href='tags/haashiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haashiyah</font></a> of al-Bayjuri upon al-Jawharah. Their need to hide this creed of theirs from the common Muslims and their great fear of the common Muslim understanding and grasping the reality of what they are saying is very old, <u>it goes back at least 800 years</u> - read Ibn Qudaamah <a href=indexb6ea.html?ilvva>clarifying this about them in this article here</a>.</div>    <P>
