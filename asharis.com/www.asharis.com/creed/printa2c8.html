<img src=assets/images/saeed-foudah.gif align=right width="120" style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;border-radius:6px;" border="1" border=0> The contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as "Ash'aris" have raised an issue regarding the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1575; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), in particular the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) which occurs in some manuscripts as (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) and which is in agreement with narrations from the Salaf who preceded Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. In this series we want to address the claims of one considered to be from the kibaar (senior) amongst the  <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> (pictured). Historically, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have always been considered corrupt in intellect and our case sample (Foudah) in these articles will be a confirmation of this trend. The reader will find truly laughable the attempt of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> to distort the statement and intent of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (in its historical context) who clarified the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah with respect to the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.     <P>
<b>The key lesson to take away from this series is that <u>history</u> is one of the routes through which the lies and fabrications of the deviants and innovators are exposed. It is known that the Sahaabah, the Taabi'een, the Muhadditheen and the Scholars of Ahl al-Hadeeth have utilized history and the historical record to falsify matters which on the surface appeared to be authentic and coherent, whether that be in relation to claims of history or chains of narration.</b>    <P>
One should also note that people like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and their ancestors are the students of the <b>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</b> and they are not the students of the <i>Sahaabah</i>, <i>Taabi'een</i> and <i>Taabi' Taabi'een</i>. The isnaad (chain) of their theological speech goes back through  the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to those same Hellenized Jews, Christians  and the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and eventually to <b>Aristotle bin Nicomachus</b> (d. 322BC) whose speech about the "<i>first cause</i>" is the actual foundation of speech regarding the deity of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. <b>At least al-Qaradawi is very frank and open about it</b>. See the little incident in the kitchen between al-Qaradawi and G.F. Haddaad, (<a href=index09b7.html?snaca>domestic problems</a> in the house of kalaam) to learn more.  </blockquote> </div> <P>




<p><blockquote><font class='titleHeadline'>Summary of the Jahmite's Claims</font>    <P>
In his explanation of al-Tahawiyyah (posted by some of his followers online) Foudah comments on the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> within which is the following (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607; &#1576;&#1583;&#1575; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>) with a number of notes. We will summarise the essence of them here and then we will refute each of these <i>shubuhaat</i> one by one inshaa'Allaah, and show that they clash with what the <i>Sahaabah</i>, <i>Taabi'een</i> and <i>Taabi' Taabi'een</i> were upon and are a distortion of Imaam al-Tahawi's speech in reality and an attempt to commandeer and steer the words of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> towards the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> doctrine of two Qur'ans. So from what <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> wrote was the following:    <P>
<b><u>ONE:</u></b> That the meaning of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) is other than the meaning of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>), the meaning of the first is when something (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1592;&#1607;&#1585; &#1592;&#1607;&#1608;&#1585;&#1575; &#1576;&#1610;&#1606;&#1575;</span>), that is, <i>something appearing manifestly</i> and as for the second, it is <i>commencement, beginning</i>. The intent behind this is to show that (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) implies that a matter that already exists appears and manifests whereas (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) means something commences and begins to exist. <b><u>TWO:</u></b> With respect to the saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577;</span>) that this is a negation of Allaah's speech being with <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> and letter (<i>al-sawt wal-harf</i>), since <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> and letter is the <i>kaifiyyah</i> for the created beings. Also that negation of a <i>kaifiyyah</i> (with respect to speech) establishes Allaah's eternity, His eternity in all His attributes, in refutation of the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who affirm <i>hawaadith</i> (events) for Allaah in His essence in the sense that Allaah acquires attributes He never had before, but which subsequently become permanent and eternal. <b><u>THREE:</u></b> <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> states that the saying of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;</span>) establish the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which "appeared, manifested" from Allaah, appeared as speech (qawl) and was not just meaning (ma'naa) alone, this being in opposition to the one who said Allaah inspired the meaning to Jibreel who expressed it through the words revealed to the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). His intent here is to say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, as it was revealed to the Prophet (sallallaau alayhi wasallam) manifested from Allaah and no intermediary had any role therein (in determining the words). This sounds a little strange, but the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> give explanations so as to make their innovation appear as closely as possible to what Ahl al-Sunnah affirm, though they intend something else by it, and which is entirely subservient to an over-arching innovated doctrine (<a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>). We will reveal what Foudah is attempting here at the relevant place in this series, but the intent becomes a little clearer from the point that follows. <b><u>FOUR:</u></b> In the next point, <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> reveals that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (as we have it) is from the Preserved Tablet (<i>al-Lawh al-Mahfudh</i>) and this is one of three explanations given by those who hold the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created (as does Foudah). Some of them say the wording originated with Jibreel, other says Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and others say that it was in the Preserved Tablet, and this is the view of Foudah. This allows them to say that both the meaning (<i>ma'naa</i>) and the wording (<i>lafdh</i>) is from Allaah, and also allows them to obscure the fact that they (in opposition to Imaam al-Tahawi) believe the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. <b><u>FIVE:</u></b> He says about the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1571;&#1610;&#1602;&#1606;&#1608;&#1575; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1602;&#1610;&#1602;&#1577;&#1548; &#1604;&#1610;&#1587; &#1576;&#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602; &#1603;&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1585;&#1610;&#1577;</span>), "They are certain that it is the speech of Allaah, the Exalted, in reality. It is not created like the speech of the creation" that it emphasizes what was mentioned earlier: The wording (lafdh) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was not produced by anyone from the creation, and that it does not mean that Allaah spoke with letter and <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> since this is negated through (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1603;&#1610;&#1601;</span>), "<i>without how</i>." <b><u>SIX:</u></b> Foudah then makes the allegation at the end of this passage in his commentary regarding the statement (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1605;&#1606; &#1608;&#1589;&#1601; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1576;&#1605;&#1593;&#1606;&#1609; &#1605;&#1606; &#1605;&#1593;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585; &#1601;&#1602;&#1583; &#1603;&#1601;&#1585;</span>), that it comprises takfeer of those who say Allaah spoke with <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> and letter, and of those who say that Allaah creates voices and letters in His self and the Salaf and their followers do not say this, this is a deliberate misattribution based upon the corrupt understanding that is with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> on the nature of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1593;&#1604;</span>) in the Arabic language and which they evaluate in light of Aristotelian conceptual baggage as we shall see.     <P>
So this is the essence of what the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> has claimed and we shall address each of these issues one by one in the articles to follow in this series. As we stated, the first way in silencing this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> is through <b>objective history</b>, through simply explaining the historical record. Often, a person or a group can contrive and fabricate an apparently coherent belief system that appears to be built upon sound foundations and to be internally consistent. However, when you look at history, you know this belief system is faulty, purely through the way it originated and came into being. <b>This is one of the ways to pull the rug from underneath <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> and expose his fraud and show that he is in fact a student of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and not of the Sahaabah, Taabi'een and Taabi' Taabi'een</b>. Hence, in the first article in this series we want to explain how the doctrine he holds on to came to be. Foudah's doctrine is as follows: <i>That Allaah has an eternal <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which is a meaning (ma'naa) in the self. That Allaah Himself gave rise to the wording (lafdh) through what is in the Preserved Tablet, this being from Allaah not from anyone else, and hence both the meaning and the wording can be said to be "from Allaah."</i> This is a deceptive way of concealing the belief that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have present with us, recited, heard and memorized is something Allaah <b>created</b> in the Preserved Tablet, a (created) manifestation of the meaning that is with His self and it is Allaah from whom it "manifested" in its created form (not from any created being). So lets us recount history a little to establish how, why and when this doctrine appeared. Note that the historical affairs have been documented extensively in other articles in this site so you can refer to them for greater detail.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Origin of the Saying of Two Qu'rans Lies in the Rejection of Allaah Speaking and Acting Through Will and Choice (Ikhtiyaar) Which Itself is Taken from the Star and Idol Worshipping <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a> and Not From the Revealed Books and Sent Messengers</font>    <P>
<b>The <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, chief amongst them <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, denied that the "first cause" acts through will (mashee'ah) and choice (ikhtiyaar)</b>. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> declared the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created upon this consideration (the denial that Allaah speaks through His will) as this necessitates hawaadith (newly-originated things) in Allaah's essence, and also from the consideration that attributes necessitate composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>) in the essence of Allaah. The shubhah (misconception) regarding Allaah's will and choice was carried to the Ash'aris and Maturidis from the star-worshipping idolators (of fourth century BC Greece) through the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, then through the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>. It is firmly and undeniably established through historical record that the origin of the theology of the <b>Kalam Dynasty</b> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) lies in the theology of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and ultimately in the conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (see the series "<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>" - <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>read here</a>) whose logic, philosophy and <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> comprise the conceptual platform upon which their <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> is built. When this "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" appeared in the second century hijrah from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they were forced to deny the symbols of Islamic belief on account of it and it was this specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and its people who were condemned by the Salaf. From the major symbols they denied were Allaah's <i><a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a></i>, His <i><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></i> in general, His <i>ru'yah</i>, His <i>speech</i> and His <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i>. The reason for the denial of these symbols is because they acquired a proof from the Hellenized Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (<i>the kalam cosmological argument</i>) which argues that the presence of <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (attributes) and <i>hawaadith</i> (actions) in observed bodies proves their originated nature and upon the false principle of <i>the impossibility an endless chain of events in the past</i>, they thought they had established the universe is originated and thereby established a cause for it. Then, by the very nature of the argument used, they were forced to deny attributes (<i><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></i>) and actions (<i>af'aal</i>) from the cause they had established because they had no option but to consider them as <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes) and <i>hawaadith</i> (events) which can only be said of bodies in light of the Aristotelian conceptual baggage they had agreed upon as the platform of debate. From here they began to assault the revealed texts with <i>tahreef</i> in the name of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> and this was pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the second century hijrah and continued later by the Ash'aris and Maturidis, because the revealed texts indicate attributes and actions tied to will and power. The Salaf declared the first <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (as a genus) to be disbelievers, heretics and condemned anyone who spoke about Allaah's attributes on the basis of this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> gained strength and influenced the rulers towards the end of the second century hijrah and they began to put the scholars in the various Muslim lands to trial with the saying that the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created (a consequential belief arising from the Aristotelian conceptual baggage they founded their theology upon). In the third century hijrah, <b><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a></b> (d. 241H) stood against these heretics and aided the creed of the Companions, the successors and their successors during the trials of 225H to 232H. He was granted and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were subdued and humiliated. They became despised and scorned in the eyes of the people and their worth diminished a great deal.    <P>
However, a group appeared led by <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H), and they also refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (especially in the fields of Allaah's <u><a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a></u> and the <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i>). But they were not deeply grounded in the Sunnah and fell prey to some of the doubts of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, specifically on the subject of Allaah's speech and His will (<i>mashee'ah</i>). As a result a new doctrine named <i><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></i> was innovated (as a solution to the problem) by <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> in order to <u>combine</u> between the doctrine of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the doctrine of Ahl al-Sunnah. This doctrine was required by the denial that Allaah is one who speaks and acts through choice (ikhtiyaar) and will (mashee'ah).    <P>
This meant that there were now three deviant positions whose basis ultimately lies in the importation of the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> and philosophy of star worshipping idolators (of fourth century BC Greece) into Islamic theological discourse and these three views are: <b>a) Jahmiyyah:</b> Allaah has no attributes and does not speak, therefore the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, <b>b) Mu'tazilah:</b> Allah does not have any attributes (as this would imply composition) so attributes are either synonymous with his essence or other than His essence. Upon the latter, his speech is treated in the same way that any other created entity (like a mosque, or messenger) is ascribed to Him, and thus His speech (the Arabic Qur'an) is created, being other than His essence <b>c) Kullaabiyyah:</b> Since Allaah does not act through will and choice, then His speech is eternal like all other attributes, but it is eternal as a meaning in the self only and as for the Arabic <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, it is created and is a quotation (hikaayah) of that singular eternal meaning. This third view required <b>a distortion</b> of the meaning of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (speech) which in the language of the Arabs is <i>lafdh</i> (expression) and <i>ma'naa</i> (meaning) together. The view of the Salaf was that Allaah speaks with a <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a> that can be heard (that is unlike all other voices) and this is also the view presented by <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> as is explicit in his statements (as we shall see in later articles). However, this newly innovated doctrine required <b>a distortion</b> of the definition of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and thus reliance was made on the poetry of <b>a Trinitarian Christian</b> called <a href='tags/al-akhtal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Akhtal</font></a> (real name Ghiy&#257;th bin Ghawth bin al-Salt al-Taghlab&#299;, a Christian Poet in the Umayyad Dynasty), in which he says, "<i>Indeed speech is in the heart (self, soul) [in reality]. And the tongue is merely an indicator for what is in the heart</i>." This innovated doctrine was carried by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, after he abandoned the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and it became the standard doctrine of those who ascribed to <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> thereafter.     <P>
Abu Nasr al-Sijz&#299; (d. 444H) explains how the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> overcame <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, which led him to develop his third, innovated doctrine to stand a middle ground between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl al-Sunnah. This middle ground was the one adopted and supported by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. He wrote in Al-Radd &#703;al&#257; man Ankara al-Harf wal-Sawt (tahq&#299;q, Muhammad B&#257; Kar&#299;m B&#257; &#703;Abd All&#257;h, D&#257;r al-R&#257;yah, 1994, p. 80-81):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So when Ibn Kull&#257;b and his likes emerged and tried to refute the Mu&#703;tazilah through the path of pure reason without being well-versed in the foundations of the Sunnah and nor in what the Salaf were upon, and nor did they seek proof through the reports narrated in that (subject), due to their claim that they are akhb&#257;r &#257;h&#257;d which do not amount to knowledge, the Mu&#703;tazilah made binding upon them (to accept) that there is agreement that speech (kal&#257;m) is letter and <a href='tags/voice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Voice</font></a>, and that it contains succession, sequence (ta&#703;&#257;qub) and composition (ta'l&#299;f), and that this is not found in what is observed except that it is with motion (harakah), rest (suk&#363;n), and that it is necessary that is has parts (ajz&#257;', ab&#703;&#257;d), and that whatever is like this is not permitted to be from the attributes of the essence of All&#257;h, because the essence of All&#257;h, the Sublime, is not described with union (ijtim&#257;&#703;), separation (iftir&#257;q), and whole (kull) and part (ba&#703;d), and motion (harakah) and rest (suk&#363;n). And the ruling upon an attribute of the essence, is a ruling upon the essence too. They (the Mu&#703;tazilah) said: So it is known through these points that the kal&#257;m that is annexed to All&#257;h, the Sublime, is a creation of His which He brought about and then ascribed to Himself, just as you say, "the servant of All&#257;h", and "the creation of All&#257;h" and "the action of All&#257;h."    <P>
So Ibn Kull&#257;b and his likes became hard-pressed in the soul with this coercion (in argument) due to their meagre knowledge of the Sunan, abandoning its acceptance, and submitting their reigns to pure reason (alone). So they submitted to what the Mu&#703;tazilah made binding upon them, and then embarked upon [what amounts to] haughtiness in vision , and they plundered the established ijm&#257;&#703; amongst everyone, the Muslim and the disbeliever.    <P>
So they said to the Mu&#703;tazilah: That which you have mentioned is not the reality of kal&#257;m (speech), but it is called kal&#257;m metaphorically due it being a quotation (hik&#257;yah) or expression (&#703;ib&#257;rah) of it (the real kal&#257;m). And the reality of kal&#257;m is 'a meaning established in the essence of the speaker.' Some of them limited themselves to this much, and amongst them were those who took precaution from that which was known to enter into this particular definition (of theirs), thus they added to (this definition) what negates silence (suk&#363;t), dumbness (kharas) and impairments to speech. </blockquote>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Distorting the Revealed Texts and the Statements of the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah Upon This New Innovated Saying</font>    <P>
Once the above is clear, and all of what has preceded is a matter of historical record, then academic fraudsters like <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> will not teach their audiences history for obvious reasons, and nor is it in their interests to identify for their audiences the context, situation, background and timing of the emergence of their doctrine. This would uncover the inherent fraud in all their attempts to distort and twist the statements of the Imaams of Ahl al-Sunnah on top of their distortion of the revealed texts of the Book and the Sunnah. Once they have this futile innovated doctrine in the bag and which they consider to be the truth, they distort the statement of every Scholar from the Salaf or Imaam from Ahl al-Sunnah to make it appear that this was the default original doctrine amongst the Muslims and is what the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) came with. This is what <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> has done in his commentary on al-Tahawi's creed. Inshaa'Allaah in the articles to come we will decipher his speech carefully, word by word, to show how the devil has beguiled <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> in interpreting the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> through the <i>aql</i> (intellect), <i><a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a></i> (philosophy) and conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and not through the understanding of the Sahabah, the Taabi'een and the authentic Arabic language.  But for now we want to start off with the first point of rebuttal in light of the previous history lesson:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Jahmites, Bring Forth Your Salaf (Predecessor)! </font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>In which <u>revealed Book</u> and in the speech of which <u>sent Messenger</u> and in the speech of which <u>Sahabi</u> and in the speech of which <u>Taabi'ee</u> and in the speech of which <u>Taabi' Taabi'ee</u> is there to be found your futile, corrupt saying that Allaah speaking and acting through will (<i>mashee'ah</i>) and choice (<i>ikhtiyaar</i>) amounts to <i>hawaadith</i> (events) in Allaah's essence rendering him a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and is thereby kufr and shirk? Answer this question if you are indeed truthful! And when we know for sure you cannot and will never be able mention a single revealed book or a name of any Prophet, Companion or Taabi'ee, then it is known you are not the students of the Companions, the Taabi'een and the Taabi' Taabi'een but rather you are the students of Aristotelian philosophy which forms the basis for your innovated <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> that came to you from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and with which you infested Islamic theology. Further, your misconception with respect to <i>hawaadith</i> (which you took from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who took it from the philosophy of star worshipping idolators) is a matter in which <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> refutes you (<a href=indexd82f.html?mdfil>see this article</a>) and in which honest Maturidis invalidate your false claims (<a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>see here</a>). For when a person speaks or acts, it is not said in the language of the Arabs that "he created speech (or action) in his essence". This is a distortion and corruption in the understanding of language, and your distortion of the Arabic language is for the sake of the <i>aql</i> of a star-worshipping idolator whose philosophical conceptual baggage you agreed as a platform of debate.</b></blockquote>    <P>
When the answer to this question is demanded from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (and the answwer to it is already known in any case), <b>their fraud is laid bare</b> and the true origin of their positioning in the issue of Allaah's speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> becomes clear and all of their subsequent distortions of the statements of the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah (like al-Tahawi's) become apparent. <b>So it is said to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in essence you have no right to comment on the statements of these Scholars until and unless you can establish and demonstrate the origins of the theoretical basis for your position</b>. And it is here that we are led, through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, to the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and ultimately to the brain of a star worshipping idolator of 4th century BC Greece and his philosophy. In particular one of his nine <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes), "<i>action</i>" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1593;&#1604;</span>), which is indicative of "<i><a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a></i>". This is really the foundation of their saying which they conceal from all people out of cowardice and deception, as they do not wish for the people to realize that this doctrine's basis is the <i>aql</i> of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> and not the <i>wahy</i> of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> is Really Saying is Concealed Through Hypocrisy and Sophistry: Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi Explains...</font>    <P>
Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee (d. 620H) said about the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in his book, "<i>Hikaayat ul-Munaadharah fil-Qur'aan Ma'a Ba'd Ahl il-Bid'ah</i>" (Narrative of the Debate Regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with Some of the People of Innovation) - which is his documenting of his debate with the Ash'aris on the subject of the Qur'aan. He says on pages 34-35:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the focus of [these] people [the Ash'arites] is to [say] the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created and to agree with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, but they love that this should not be known about them, so they embarked upon [sophistry] that [amounts] to arrogant rejection of observable reality, and rejection of the realities, and opposition to the consensus (ijmaa), and throwing the Book and the Sunnah behind their backs, and speaking with something that no one before them has said, neither Muslim nor Disbeliever. And it is strange that they are not daring enough to proclaim their [real] saying openly, and nor to explicitly state it, except in secluded gatherings, even if they were [ones] in authority (i.e. rulers) and were the leaders of the state. And if you were to quote [to others] from their saying that they believe, they would hate it and reject it and become arrogant over it.     <P>
And we do not know amongst the people of innovation, any faction who conceal their saying, and do not have the boldness to proclaim it (openly) except the Heretics (Zanaadiqah) and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. And Allaah, the Exalted, order His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) to openly proclaim the religion, to call to it, and to convey what Allaah revealed to Him, so the Most High said:<b> O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.</b> (5:67). So if their saying - as they claim - is the truth, then why do they not openly proclaim it and call the people to it? And how is it lawful for them to hide it and conceal it, and to proclaim openly what is different to it, deceiving the public [into thinking they] believe other than it? Rather, if their saying was the truth that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), His Companions, and the Imaams of the religion after them were upon, how come not one of them openly proclaimed it? And did they all concur upon concealing it? Or how was it lawful for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) to conceal it from his ummah whilst he had been ordered to convey what had been revealed to him, and had beed threatened against concealing anything from it with His saying: <b>And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message.</b> (5:67). And how was it possible for him to make the people presume (something) in opposition to the truth?</blockquote>    <P>
Saeed Foudah believes the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created but he is too cowardly to admit it. He distorts the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a> by playing around with the words (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1575;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) so as to support the created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> doctrine in a stealth manner. These games are just a continuation of what Ibn Qudaamah pointed out about these hypocritical, cowardly <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> 800 or so years go.      <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
Once this crucial first point of refutation (as it relates to history) has been made [and it is an extremely powerful point, a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> has no option but to flee on his heels like a coward when faced with it] we are then in a position to address the claims of <a href='tags/saeed-foudah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saeed Foudah</font></a> in more detail and his attempted stealth distortion of the statement of <a href='tags/al-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Tahawi</font></a>. In Part 2, we present the belief of the Sahaabah that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> commenced (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1571;</span>) with Allaah speaking it in reality (a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah and Saalimiyyah), with actual speech, upon our understanding that Allaah speaking and acting <u>through will (<i>mashee'ah</i>)</u> does not necessitate created events in His essence as that is an illegitimate, corrupt conception unknown in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and in the Arabic language, and originates in the philosophy of star-worshipping idolators. Rather it is a sign of His utmost perfection.     <P>
