<p>All praise is due to Allah and may the prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger to proceed:     <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> In a previous article (<a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>see here</a>), we highlighted the scandals of a counterfeit pretender, posing in front of his audience as an erudite <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> and Champion of the (<a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>) Ash'ari creed. In reality, we are dealing with a deluded primary school child.    <P>
After showing his treachery in quoting, and his slander upon <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that he claims Allaah is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (when in fact <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says <a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>this is impossible and denied for Allaah</a>) - the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> discreetly acknowledged his error in quotation and updated his page (20th August 2009). However, out of childish resentment, he felt the need to vent his anger and frustration, just like a schoolchild, and decided to add more slanders and fabrications on the same page to make himself feel better. He thought that adding five, six frauds on top of his original fraud would win him favors with his audience.    <P>
It looks like after <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>being disciplined previously with the sandal</a> he has decided to come back and beg for another round with the sandal of Abdullaah bin Abi Ja'far ar-Raazee (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see the opening to this article here</a>)     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> On <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> on <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and <a href="tags/al-hadd.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-hadd</font></a></font>    <P>
Here is one of the issues that our counterfeit <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> has added to his arsenal of frauds (on 20th August 2009):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-six-limits-quote.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Abu Adam <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> is a glutton for punishment and thus, with <b>the "Bayaan"</b> in one hand and <b>the sandal</b> in the other:    <P>
<b><u>Point 1: <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> Doesn't Know Who is Saying What</u></b>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> who makes takfir of the righteous Scholars! If you are going put yourself forward in front of the people, donning the [fake] garment of an erudite Kalam Atomist championing the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> creed (pretending it is the creed of Abu Hasan al-Ash'ari) - and you want to do this under the guise of honesty and integrity, then there are certain requirements you need to abide by. From them is that when you quote statements you actually:    <P>
<ul><li>Grasp what is being discussed  <li> And who is saying what</ul>    <P>
This ensures that when you ascribe a statement (or a belief) to someone, you are ascribing it to the right person. This is important because otherwise you are fabricating lies upon people by ascribing a statement to them which is not actually theirs, and then the guise of honesty and integrity you are using to try to conceal yourself becomes exposed ...    <P>
Here is the quote from the "Bayaan":    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-26.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Obviously this requires some background and we will develop this point in what follows. However, we need to clarify who is saying what - so here is a translation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So this is the moderate saying amongst the three sayings of al-Qadi [Abu Ya'laa] and it is in conformity with the speech of Ahmad and others from the (leading) scholars.    <P>
And he (Abu Ya'laa) had said:    <P>
<blockquote>He, the Most High, is in a specific direction and He does not go (extend) in all [six] directions, rather He is outside of the universe, distinguished from His creation, separate from them, not entering (into the creation) in all directions. And this is the meaning of the saying of Ahmad, "<i>[With a] hadd, that no one knows except He</i>".</blockquote>    <P>
And If the intent of Ahmad - rahimahullaah - had been "<a href="tags/al-hadd.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-hadd</font></a>" in the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> only, then that would have been known to His servants, for they knew that His hadd in this direction is <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. It is known therefore, that the hadd which they do not know (i.e. that which <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> is speaking of, as quoted by Abu Ya'laa) is unrestricted and not specific to the direction of <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
Right, now this is clear and we know who is saying what, let us now revisit the Jahmee Baleed's quotation with the sandal of Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far. But first very quickly, we need give just a little bit of background. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is discussing the issue of "<a href="tags/al-hadd.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-hadd</font></a>" narrated from Ibn al-Mubaarak and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (in refutation of the Jahmites), and he is addressing what has been said by <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in his explanation of this. Abu Ya'laa initially rejected speaking with "hadd", but later permitted it. So <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is quoting the different views of Abu Ya'laa, and commenting upon them.    <P>
Now, lets see what our Jahmee Dimwit makes of the situation:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-six-limits-quote-2.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
A number of points:    <P>
<ul><li> First he thinks <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is ascribing the part underlined in red to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, when that is not the case, its actually the speech of al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa!    <P>
<li> Second, he thinks the part that is underlined in green is the speech of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, when it is in fact still the speech of al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa!    <P>
<li> So what is underlined in green and red is all from the speech of <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a>.</ul>    <P>
As we said earlier, if you are going to take on the occupation of a <a href='tags/21st-century-kalam-atomist.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>21st Century Kalam Atomist</font></a> and Champion of the Jahmee Creed of negating their is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, then you need to show at least some degree of competence, instead of the heights of compound ignorance (al-jahl al-murakkab).    <P>
The above is to show that the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> is an incompetent fool who is not to be trusted in quoting - and he has now demonstrated this more than once, <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>as we have shown previously</a>. It does not however, address the actual issue and the doubt that he is bringing - so we need to address this now.    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: What is The Wider Context to What is Being Discussed? It is The Refutation of the Salaf Against the Hulooli <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Who Claimed Allaah is in Every Place And Some of the Salaf Said Allaah Is Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> With a "Hadd"</u></b>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> We have covered in previous articles why some of the Salaf such as Ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181H) and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> used the word "hadd" when speaking about Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (see <a href=index91e1.html?voloh>here</a> and <a href=index86d6.html?ydwuv>here</a>). To cover this from another angle, recall that <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> used to debate with the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who also used to believe in the transmigration of souls - they were called the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and this is well document. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> mentions the debates of al-Jahm with these people in his book "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" (<a href=index7863.html?upfkv>see this article for details</a>) and what we gather from that is that the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> argued against Jahm saying you have not seen, nor heard, nor touched, nor smelt your Lord, so He cannot exist - this is because they only believed in what could be perceived with the senses.     <P>
So al-Jahm became bewildered and confused, not knowing who he was worshipping, and he abandoned the prayer for forty-days in his confusion. Then he concocted an answer to them which is similar to what the Christians hold that Allaah indwells within the creation in the form of a spirit, and thus speaks and commands through them. So he came back to those <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and said to them, you believe that there is a soul that occupies your body, so have you seen it? Have you heard it?  Have you touched it? Have you smelt it? And they obviously said "No." So Jahm said that this is how my Lord is. He is witnessed and observed in everything and everywhere and at the same time, He cannot be seen, or heard, or touched, or smelt. So this was his response and in this manner he believed he convinced them of Allaah's existence, whilst rebutting their argument against him.    <P>
And it is from this that the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> arose which is that Allaah is everywhere, on this earth, in the heaven, within everything in the creation, not separate from it and so on - and alongside this, He cannot be seen, nor heard, nor perceived in any way, and nor can He be described with anything. All the sayings of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> regarding Allaah and His attributes emanated from al-Jahm's debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> and also what al-Jahm took from al-Ja'd bin Dirham from speaking about Allaah with negatives (sifaat salbiyyah) which al-Ja'd took from the pseudo-Sabean Harranian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.    <P>
And from their well known sayings was that "<i>we not believe in a Lord that is in one place exclusive to another</i>" - and this phrase and this terminology was their invention, and by necessity this meant that they had to deny Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, since if He was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, He could not be everywhere. However, at first they did not initially raise this matter, as their falsehood would have become readily apparent, because this matter was firmly established in the hearts of the common folk, let alone the Scholars. So instead they raised the issue of seeing Allah (ar-Ru'yah) and that of the Qur'aan being created, and through these affairs they were hinting or alluding to Allaah not being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
So when these people emerged with this orientation from just before the middle of the second century (around 150H), the Imaams of the Salaf knew what they were trying to do and this is why you see statements from the Salaf as reported by Imaam ad-Dhahabee, in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.146):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sulayman bin Harb said: I heard Hammad bin Zayd (d. 179H) saying: "They are circulating around [the issue of] of wanting to say that there is no deity above the heaven". He means the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
So note here what Hammaad bin Zayd said that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, in their speech, they were circulating around the issue of wanting to express that Allaah is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without going as far as saying that explicitly.    <P>
And the saying of Yazeed bin Haroon (d. 208H) as quoted by <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a> in his Ibtaal ut-Ta'weelaat:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever claimed that "<b>ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne</b>" is [understood up a meaning] different to what is established in the hearts of the general folk is a Jahmee.</blockquote>    <P>
Meaning that it is established with the common folk that Allaah ascending above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> means He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and not within or merged with the creation.    <P>
And then what has been said by 'Abbaad bin al-Awwaam al-Waasitiyy (d. 185H), as has been reported by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> in <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (p.88), Ibn al-Qayyim in "Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah) (2/216) and Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 65):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I spoke to Bishr al-Mareesee and his associates, and I saw that the final (part) of their speech ends up with them saying there is nothing above the heaven.</blockquote>    <P>
And then what has been said by Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee  (d. 198H) as narrated by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah", and Abdullah bin Ahmad in "as-Sunnah" (no. 147), and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> also referenced it to "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" of Ibn Abee Haatim:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is not amongst the people of desires [those] more evil than the companions of Jahm [bin Safwan]. They are revolving around [the issue] of wanting to say that there is nothing above the heaven. I consider, by Allaah, that they are not to be married into, and nor should inheritance (be given to them or taken from them).</blockquote>    <P>
So when this occurred and the Imaams of the Salaf knew and understood what these people were intending (that Allaah is in every place), then we find statements of the Salaf in refutation of this and in clarification of the truth. So to rebut this deviant creed of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> some of the Salaf expressed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, "bi haddin" (with a limit, demarcation) - meaning by this that Allaah is not within the creation, rather He is separate and distinct from it, in opposition to what the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were trying to spread amongst the people.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Ibn Mandhoor said, in Lisaanul-Arab, "Al-hadd, the parting (fasl) between two things such that one of them does not mix with the other, or that one of them does not extend into the other".</div>    <P>
And so they used this phrase to defend the truth and repel falsehood, and the likes of this term, when it has a meaning of truth, then it is from the baab (field) of al-ikhbaar (informing) about Allaah, which is wider than the field of the Names and Attributes.    <P>
In the Tabaqaat ul-Hanaabilah of Ibn Abee Ya'laa there occurs (1/267):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/imaamahmad-ibnalmubaarak-hadd.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muhammad bin Ibraaheem al-Qaysee said: I said to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal: It is quoted from Ibn al-Mubaarak that it was said to him: How do we know our Lord - the Mighty and Majestic? He said, "Above (fee) the heaven, upon ('alaa) His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with a hadd (limit, demarcation)." So Ahmad said, "This is how it is with us". </blockquote>    <P>
<ul><li> Ad-Daarimee reported it in 'ar-Radd 'alal-Mareesee' (p.34)   <li> And also in his 'ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah (162)   <li> 'Abdullaah bin Ahmad in 'as-Sunnah' (1/175)   <li> al-Bayhaqee in 'al-Asmaa was-Sifaat' (p.427) from the route of 'Alee bin al-Hasan bin Shaqeeq who said, "I asked 'Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak, I said, 'How do we know our Lord?' He replied, 'Above (fee) the seventh heaven, upon His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.' I said, 'But the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say He is like this!' He replied, 'We do not say as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say, we say He is as He is.' I said, 'With a limit (bi  haddin)?' He replied, 'Yes, by Allaah, with a limit (bi haddin).'"  <li> And Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> said in 'al-'Uluww' (p.152 of its 'Mukhtasir'), "<b>This is saheeh (authentic) from Ibn al-Mubaarak and Ahmad, may Allaah be pleased with him</b>."   <li>And Shaikh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in 'al-Hamawiyyah' (5/184 of Majmoo' ul-Fataawaa), "<b>This is well-known from Ibn al-Mubaarak, established from him from more than one aspect and it is also affirmed from Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin Raahawaih and from more than one of the Imaams</b>."</ul>    <P>
So now we have our context and we understand what is going on. In the face of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the Salaf affirmed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, separate and distinct from the creation, and this is why the Imaams from the Salaf spoke with the likes of these terms "bi haddin" and "baa'inun min khalqihi", meaning that Allaah is not within the creation, not merged with it - so the debate is between the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and the Salaf used these phrases.    <P>
Once we have understood this, then those who came later, such as the likes of <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, they discussed this issue of Ibn al-Mubaarak and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others using the word "bi haddin" in relation to Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and they attempted to explain it and what was intended by it and <a href='tags/al-qadi-abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qadi Abu Ya'laa</font></a> had a number of sayings on the issue, he initially rejected the application of speaking with the words "hadd" and "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>" but later said that it was permissible in a particular context.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To understand the treachery of this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> (<a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>) and his likes (whether  past or present), you have picture the scenario. There is a raging battle between the leading Imaams of the Salaf and the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are waging this battle to convince the common Muslims that Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, is in every place, within His creation, in the bodies of men, in the interiors of dogs and swines, and the places of filth, in the earth and within His universe, and not in any one place exclusive to others and so on - and this is because of the creed that al-Jahm bin Safwaan concocted after his debates with the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>.     <P>
Then you have the Salaf waging a war back, and clarifying that Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, speaking with the manifest verses and ahaadeeth, and clarifying that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> "bi haddin", meaning that He is distinct and separate from the creation, with a demarcation between Himself and the creation, such that He does not merge with it - and these clarifications were to support the manifest creed that the whole Ummah was upon prior to the emergence of these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - which is that Allaah exists separate and distinct from the creation, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>.    <P>
So if you picture this war going on - then along comes the likes of this <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> and all those like him historically speaking (such as ar-Raazee and others) and so what they do is instead of assaulting the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and their statements, they assault the Salaf, and the clarifications of the Salaf and the phrases and terms they used to defend the creed. So when you understand the objectives of the leading Imaams of the Salaf, like those from whom we have quoted, like Ibn al-Mubaarak, Hammaad bin Zayd, <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and others, and how they were intending to refute the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and when you understand the objectives of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - and you see these two factions waging a war against each other, then it is from the greatest and mightiest forms of treachery that your allegiance, affectation and sympathy is with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> rather than with the Salaf. This is evidenced by the fact that they attack the clarifications of the Salaf - their use of such phrases, "bi haddin", and "baa'inun min khalqihi" and "bi dhaatihi" and so on which were to refute the vile and filthy belief of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> that Allaah is in every place.    </div>    <P>
<b><u>Point 3: This Issue Is of No Concern To The <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> Because He Does Not Affirm There Is A Deity Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> To Begin With, Thus It Is Falsehood For Him To Even Raise This Issue</u></b>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/beat-jahmee-with-sandal.gif align=left border=0> This is similar to the issue of Allaah's Descent (<a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>) - the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> also tried to deny this because it relates to their bid'ah in a number of ways. First the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> requires that Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (something which contradicts Him being everywhere) and secondly it is an action tied to Allaah's will, which to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> is a "haadithah" (event, occurrence) and this would mean to them that Allaah is a body, as only bodies undergo occurrences (hawaadith).     <P>
So the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> began raising doubts about the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, and from their questions was "<i>Does Allaah's <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> become unoccupied when He descends or not?</i>" - so they are the ones who innovated this as they were not content with those ahaadeeth. They tried to cast doubts upon these narrations by making it necessary that Allaah would have to enter His creation if He descended according to the ahaadeeth, so they raised these doubts and the Salaf responded that Allaah descends however He wills, meaning that He is able to descend exactly as He said without the false necessities arising in the corrupt minds of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.     <P>
So the issue here is that you do not affirm Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with, or that there is a Lord above the Heavens,  the question of whether <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becomes unoccupied or not does not even concern you. This is only relevant if you affirm there is a deity above the heaven and above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. So this is deception on behalf of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> on this particular issue.    <P>
Adh-Dhahabee brings, with a saheeh isnaad the following narration (in Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, p. 193-194):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And Ibrahim bin Abi Talib said: I heard Ahmad bin Sa'eed ar-Ribaatee saying: I attended the gathering of Ibn Tahir [the Ameer of Khurasaan] and Ishaaq [bin Raahawaih] attended. He was asked about the hadeeth of <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (Descent), whether it is authentic. He said, "Yes". One of the chiefs (of the Ameer) said, "How does He descend?" So he (Ishaaq) said: "Affirm Him [being above the Throne] for me such that I can describe the descent to you" So the man said, "I affirm Him [to be] above". So Ishaaq said, "Allaah said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And your Lord will come, and the Angels, ranks upon ranks </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Then Ibn Tahir said, "This is on the Day of Judgement O Aba Ya'qub". So he (Ishaaq) said, "And He who comes on the Day of Judgement, who prevents Him today?"</blockquote>    <P>
And Shaykh ul-Islaam, Abu Isma'eel al-Harawi (d. 481H) narrates, in his book "Dhamm ul-Kalaam":    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>From Muhammad bin Ishaaq ath-Thaqafi: I heard Ishaaq [bin Raahawaih] bin Ibraaheem al-Handhali (who) said: I entered one day upon [Abdullaah bin] Taahir and Mansur bin Talhah was present with him. Mansur said to me, "O Abu Ya'qub! You say that Allaah descends to the lowest heaven every night?" I said, "And we believe in it, but you do not believe that you have a Lord [that is] above the heaven, so you are not in need of asking me about this?!" So he (Ibn Tahir) said (to Mansur), "Did I not forbid you regarding this Shaykh (meaning Ishaaq bin Raahawaih).</blockquote>    <P>
We see from these narrations that Ishaaq bin Raahawaih - before answering the question - asked one of those detractors who were trying to stir the Ameer against him, whether he affirms Allaah is above or not, and he told him that the issue of is of no concern to him because he does affirm a Lord above the heaven in the first place. This is because the speech about the Descent branches off the affirmation of the foundation, which is Allaah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. And if this is not affirmed in the first place, then questioning the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> is false speech.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:25px;">The <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has no right to raise and dispute in this particular issue because he does not believe there is a Lord above the heaven, or a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with, in agreement with the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Atheists. Thus, there is no place for him in this discussion and his entering into it and raising it is intellectual fraud. It is only a point of discussion for those affirming there is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. And in opposition to the Atheist <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the Salaf, with unanimous agreement affirmed Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, with His Essence (al-Qurtubi: see <a href=indexddfc.html?mnwfg>here</a> and <a href=index4beb.html?wmhvd>here</a>) as did  the Early As'haris (<a href=index24b1.html?ddxry>see here</a>). And therefore, the issue arose of Allaah being distinct and separate from His creation, the highest of which is His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and thus, in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, some of the early Salaf stated that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with a demarcation, limit (hadd). Now the issue of Allaah having a "hadd" the reality of which only Allaah knows and which is not restricted just to <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> alone <u>is only a point of discussion</u> if it is <u>first accepted and affirmed</u> that Allaah is in fact above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence. To raise questions about this issue without first acknowledging that it is indeed the truth that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, is an intellectual fraud.</font></div>    <P>
And we have a similar situation here with this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a>, regarding this particular issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> "bi haddin" as stated by Ibn al-Mubaarak, <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and Ishaaq bin Raahwaih: Of what concern is it to the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> what was discussed historically of the issue of "hadd (demarcation, limit) by some of the Scholars who affirmed Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>? It is of no concern to you because you negate there is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> to begin with (just like your predecessors, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of old). So leave off this pretense and deception. This only becomes an issue of discussion between ourselves, the followers of the Book and the Sunnah and the Salaf, and yourselves (the inheritors of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of the Greeks, the followers of the doctrines of al-Jahm and al-Ja'd) if you affirm there is a deity above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and as you do not, there is no place in this discussion for you at all.    <P>
