<div class="articleContent">






<p>In previous articles, we documented the view of al-Baqillani, the most prominent early Ash'ari theologian, and stated that he held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without that necessitating <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> or confinement. And on this basis, contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> need to repent from their slanders against the entire body of Ahl us-Sunnah, from the time of the Companions to this day of ours, since the  most prominent or important Ash'ari theologian has confirmed that what is apparent in the Book and the Sunnah - that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, - does not necessitate at the same time that He is confined in space or a body like the bodies.    <P>
Unfortunately, Some of the less well-informed <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> claimed that from the statement quoted, al-Baqillani says no such thing and they made remarks that indicate that the most they understood from al-Baqillani was that he denies makaan (place) and negates that Allaah is a body.    <P>
Here are the previous articles:    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Qurtubi Confirms al-Baqillani Holds Allaah To Be Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> "Bi-Dhaatihi" and Makes <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> "Bi-Dhaatihi"</font>    <P>
In his book "al-Asnaa Fee Sharh <a href='tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a>  Allaah il-Husnaa", Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Ahmad <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> (and he is the mufassir, author of al-Jaami' Li Ahkaam il-Qur'aan) says, when discussing the numerous opinions held on the issue of Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascending) over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> (Volume 2, page 123):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qurtubi-baqillani-uluww.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is the translation of this statement:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> <b>And the sixth:</b> The saying of at-Tabaree, Ibn Abee Zayd, al-Qaadee Abdul-Wahhaab and a group (jamaa'ah) of shuyook (scholars) of hadeeth and fiqh (jurisprudence) and it is apparent (from) some of the books of the qaadee, Abu Bakr [al-Baqillani] - may Allaah be pleased with Him, <u>and [also] Abul-Hasan [al-Ash'ari]</u>. <b>And al-Qaadee Abd ul-Wahhaab quoted this from him, I mean from al-Qaadee Abu Bakr, textually - which is that He, the Sublime, ascends over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u> - and in some places they applied (the words) "<u>above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (fawqa arshihi)</u>"</b>.     <P>
The Imaam, Abu Bakr (Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Hadramee al-Qayrawaanee) said: "And that which I say is [what is] correct [i.e. Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, making <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> with His Essence], without confinement, nor fixing in a place, nor being inside of it, and without touching".    <P>
I [al-Qurtubi] say: This is the saying of al-Qaadee Abu Bakr in the book of his "Tamheed ul-Awaa'il". And we have mentioned it. And this has also been said by the teacher, Abu Bakr bin Fawrak in "Sharh Awaa'il il-Adillah", and it is the saying of Ibn Abdul-Barr, and at-Talamankee and others from amongst the Andulusians, and [also] al-Khattaabi in the book "Shi'aar ud-Deen", and that has already preceded.</blockquote>    <P>
Al-Qurtubi makes it clear that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> held Allaah to make <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> bi dhaatihi (with His Essence) and that He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> (fawqa arshihi) and that this is the same view as Ibn Abee Zaid (al-Qayrawaanee al-Maalikee) al-Haafidh Abu Umar Ibn Abdul-Barr and Abu Umar at-Talamankee.    <P>
Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim both bring the statements of these Scholars, and we can quote them here from Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and Ijtimaa Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah.    <P>
<b><u>From adh-Dhahabee's Mukhtasar al-Uluww</u></b>    <P>
Abu Umar at-Talamankee (d. 429H) in his book al-Wusool ilaa Ma'rifat il-Usool, in two volumes:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Muslims from Ahl us-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the meaning of His statement, "He is with you wherever you may be" and what is similar to that from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is that it [refers to] His knowledge, and that Allaah, the Most High, <u>is above the heavens with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u>, ascended (mustawin) over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> however He wills.</blockquote>    <P>
And Ibn Abee Zayd al-Qayrawaanee (d. 389H) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u> and He is in every place with His knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
And Ibn Abdul-Barr (d. 463H) after discussing the hadeeth of Nuzool:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> This is an authentic hadeeth, none of the Ahl ul-Hadeeth have differed over its authenticity, and it contains an evidence <u>that Allaah, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the seven heavens</u>, as has been said by the jamaa'ah and it is their proof against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and this is more famous to the general and specific (folk) and more well-known for it to require frequent quotation ...</blockquote>    <P>
<b><u>From Ibn al-Qayyim's Ijtimaa Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah</u></b>    <P>
From Abu Umar at-Talamankee (p. 142):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> Mention of the saying of Abu Umar at-Talamankee:He said in his book, al-Usool, "The Muslims from Ahl us-Sunnah are agreed  <u>that Allaah ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> bi dhaatihi (with His Essence)</u>." And he also said in this book, "Ahl us-Sunnah are agreed that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in reality (alaa haqeeqatihi), not metaphorically", then he quoted with his isnaad from (Imaam) Malik, his saying, "Allaah is above the heaven, and His knowledge is in every place", then he (at-Talamankee) said in this book, "The Muslims from Ahl us-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the meaning of His statement, "He is with you wherever you may be" and what is similar to that from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is that it [refers to] His knowledge, and <u>that Allaah, the Most High, is above the heavens with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u>, ascended (mustawin) over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> however He wills."</blockquote>    <P>
From Ibn Abee Zaid al-Qayrawaanee (p.150):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u> and He is in every place with His knowledge...</blockquote>    <P>
And from Ibn Abdul-Barr (p. 143):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and within this (the hadeeth of Nuzool) is evidence <u>that Allaah, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the seven Heavens</u>, as has been said by the jamaa'ah, and it is their proof against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in their saying that Allaah is in every place and is not above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>...</blockquote>    <P>
And thus from all of this - and noting that we are quoting from <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> who is considered an Ash'ari - it is established that <u>the most important figure</u> in the formalization of the Ash'ari madhhab, al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, for certain, held Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence (bi dhaatihi), making <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> with His Essence (bi dhaatihi) whilst negating from this affirmation for Allaah any confinement by space or being a body like the created bodies.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <b><u>great importance of this quote</u></b> which undermines and demolishes a huge part of the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari platform in assaulting the aqeedah of the Salaf, is that it shows the earliest <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> were smart enough not to allow the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology they were upon to blind them from affirming what is most obvious and apparent from the Book, the Sunnah, and the Salaf that preceded them - and from realizing that affirming Allah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence in no way necessitates that He is confined in space, for He is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with His Essence <u><b>without</b></u> being confined by space - which is what al-Baqillani is saying. Al-Baqillani's position - being who he is - and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> confirming this - being who he is - <b><u>really is a massive blow</u></b> to <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari apologetics.</div>    <P>
And this is exactly what the Salaf, past and present held, in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/theologians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Theologians</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of later times, who claim that declaring Allaah to be "above the Throne" necessitates confinement and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>.    <P>
And strangely enough, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> - who is considered an Ash'ari - admits that the verses (of the Qur'an) and the narrations (from the Sunnah) indicate that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, separate and distinct from all His creation, and that the Salaf clearly held Allaah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, separate and distinct from His creation, <u>even though he himself does not speak with this or choose this view</u> (!) - and we will cover this in a separate article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
