<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Asakir Refutes al-Kawthari and Other <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Fraudsters For Peddling the Same Accusation Against Abu al-Hasan al-Ashari as Abu Ali al-Ahwazi, the Kullabi Salimite. And the Argument of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Regarding Variation in the Singular and Dual of "Eye" in Versions of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is Squarely Turned Against Them</font>    <P>
The brazenness of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> never ceases to amaze when one looks at the tenacity with which they pursue their goals of claiming orthodoxy through multitudes of academic and intellectual frauds. To show you how stroppily these klutzy <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>  behave, thinking they can get away with murder, consider the following citation by them:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/faqir-ibanah-barbahari-quot.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
First notice the contradiction, in their article, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> at times deny its ascription to al-Ashari and other times clearly affirm its ascription - as proven in their statement above. In fact, it is clear that the whole article is just a dishonest attempt to discredit <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, even if they have to maintain two completely contradictory stances at one in the same time!     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>NOTE: As they have been refuted and exposed in this series, they are changing their article as they go along. We have three different versions saved now and a comparison is the subject of another article! But they are very dishonest people who clearly are not seeking the truth.</b></div>    <P>
To understand what is going on here, we need some background:    <P>
<b>ONE:</b> Abu Ali al-Ahwazi (d. 446H) wrote a book criticizing and attacking Abu al-Hasan al-Ashari. From these criticisms was that al-Ashari only wrote the book in order to please the Hanbalis of Baghdad. By the way, al-Ahwazi was from a splinter-sect of the Kullabiyyah, known as the Saalimiyyah as noted by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> who also defended al-Ashari against al-Ahwazi's claims.     <P>
<b>TWO:</b> Ibn Asaakir wrote Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari against al-Ahwazi in order defend Abu al-Hasan, and his authorship of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, and stated that whatever is in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is what al-Ashari believes, and then he quotes the opening sections of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> in which there is clear affirmation of Allah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, face, hands, eye (without ta'wil, tafwid etc.) and that al-Ashari is in agreement with Imam Ahmad in these matters.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> Ibn Asakir REFUTED the claim of al-Ahwazi that al-Ashari wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> for the Hanbalis and INVALIDATED the narration regarding al-Barbahari. He said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/faqir-ibanah-ibn-asakir-bar.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the citation of al-Ahwazi from al-Barbahari is from that in whose authenticity there is dispute and the greatest evidence for its futility is his saying that he did not become prominent in Bagdhad and thereafter left it. <b>Whereas when he went to Bagdhad, he did not leave it and nor did he travel to anywhere from it, for in [Baghdadh] was his desire (to remain) and therein is his grave and his burial ground</b>, and no one claims that he did not become prominent therein except the likes of this disgraced one. And mentioned has already preceded of his sitting in the circle of Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi [d. 340H] in the days of gathering at the western side in the grand mosque of al-Mansur ...</blockquote>    <P>
So this report is incorrect. However, if you notice in the above quotation of this report by the Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, they clipped the end part of it in which it states:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So he did not emerge (become prominent) in Baghdad and thereafter left it...</blockquote>    <P>
And it may have been deliberate or not, because this part is what invalidates the report as a whole, according to Ibn Asakir, in that al-Ashari never left Baghdad after moving there. This incidentally is also a proof that al-Ashari wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> at the end of his life, not 20 years earlier when he left the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and in Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari is proof that al-Ashari did not leave for Bagdhad until around 320H or thereafter - but this is another subject.    <P>
The point here is that al-Kawthari who published al-Tabyin of Ibn Asaakir, actually goes on to claim the very things for which Ibn Asaakir is refuting al-Ahwazi for! Al-Kawthari goes on to write on the next page (p. 392) in his footnote:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When he saw what had encircled Islam of the dangers from the evil innovators, he strove against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of Basrah, and its <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, so he subdued them. Then he went to Baghdad and strove, with all wisdom, to gradually entice the Hashawiyyah ascetics to the belief of the Sunnah through the book <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> which he authored when he first entered Baghdad</blockquote>    <P>
In other words he wrote the book not because he believed in its contents but because he wanted to entice the Hanablis and rescue them from tajsim and tashbih, and this was a way to approach them. So he  has just echoed the same type of claim as al-Ahwazi, the very one Ibn Asakir is refuting in the entirety of the book.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> And this is coming to our point now, and to the antics of these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.     <P>
What has happened is that they have used this narration (whilst hiding the fact that Ibn Asakir invalidated it) to show that when al-Ashari authored <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> (in Bagdhad) the Hanbalis did not accept it from him. So here, they actually affirm that al-Ashari authored a book called <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>. They just believe it has been tampered with. <b>Then as examples of tampering, they made Ibn Asakir's quotation of the opening sections of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> (which are dated before 571H) as the criterion for the published versions</b>. On that basis, they said that the published versions are unreliable. Why, becuase Ibn Asaakir uses eye in the singular, but not in the dual, whereas todays published versions use the dual not the single. And this really is an immaterial difference as we have pointed out in earlier articles.     <P>
When we pointed out that there was a section in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, in the Alexandrian manuscript that was fraudulently inserted into it by a bigoted Asharite, and which was lifted straight out of one of al-Ghazali's books (<a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf>see here</a>), these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> realized that they had been exposed and pounded from two angles:    <P>
<b>Firstly:</b> That Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> who printed that edition of al-Ibaanah mentioned explicitly that that manuscript has been tampered with and has had insertions into it through someone with a Mu'tazili influence (that reads as an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, because all Ash'aris after al-Juwayni [d. 478H] inherited the Mu'tazili influence towards the sifat khabariyyah). This shows <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> tamperings of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>.    <P>
<b>Secondly:</b> If you recall in <a href=indexbaa4.html?xoufz >Part 1</a>,they used Ibn Asakirs citation in al-Tabyin (p. 152-163) as the criterion of comparison. We find that when it comes to that part where this forged quote taken from <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> is found, it is obviously  not in Ibn Asakirs version. Here is the relevant place:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-ibn-asakir-istiwa.jpg border=0>    <P>
And compare with the tampered with version:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-p-21.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
This demonstrates that the entire argument has been turned on its  head against them, and that their approach of claiming tampering of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> by  using Ibn Asakir's text as the criterion and the use of a wholly immaterial insignificant difference (use of "two eyes" instead of "eye") is WEAK and NOT SUSTAINABLE and that it is more worthy and sound to claim tampering by Asharites on a more substantial and wholly material matter, which is trying to make ta'wil of <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> to something else upon the way of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which itself is refuted later in the book. And, likewise, the attempted ta'wil of hand with qudrah (power) which was another insertion into the book, as detailed in a previous article (<a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf>see here</a>).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This shows that in their reasoning and deduction of proof, these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are hypocrites in that they set out to prove, by a certain standard of reasoning, something which is very weak and unsustainable, and given the same standard of reasoning, the very opposite of what they set out to prove is absolutely binding and necessary for them.  </div>    <P>
