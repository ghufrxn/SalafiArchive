<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Term 'al-Tarkib'</font>    <P>
This is from the famous terminologies used by the various  factions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <u>later</u> Ash'aris, the Maturidis) in order to either reject Allaah's attributes, or to reject Allaah's 'uluww. This proof is primarily from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> used it, and then later <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (d. 429H) incorporated as part of his ripped-off proof from the Mutakallimin, that of <i>al-wujub</i> and <i>al-imkan</i>. And the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, when they saw the flaws in the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, they started incorporating the proof of al-tarkib, in order to cover their backs and to find alternative ways to fight Ahl al-Sunnah. So there are numerous meanings intended by al-tarkib (literally, composition):    <P>
<ol><li> <u>Composition from two or more different elements</u>, this is mixed composition and an example is a mammal made of dust, water, or out of limbs, hair, teeth and so on, or a house made of bricks, mortar, pipes and so on. There are numerous elements involved here. It can also refer to garments which are composed of different pieces.    <P>
<li> <u>Composition through adjacency</u>, in the sense that a collection of houses compose a town and what is similar to this.    <P>
<li> <u>Composition from identical particles</u>, and this is what the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> believe, that the entire universe is made up the exact same identical particle, but what gives each one its own properties is the incidental attributes residing in it. This definition comes from notions found with the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>. This is what <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> used to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, as it would necessitate "composition"    <P>
<li> <u>Composition through matter and form</u>. This refers really to something made of one element (like silver, gold, wood) and having a particular form or shape. This is from the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<li> <u>Composition of an essence and its attributes</u>. This is what the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> used in order deny the attributes. This understanding of "tarkib" is unknown in the Arabic language or in the revealed texts.    <P>
<li>  <u>Composition of an essence and its existence</u>. This is not really "composition" since this is what the mind thinks of, it can think of a thing and of its existence and so it can separate these two things its mind about a single object. However, that is not the case in external reality.  </ol>    <P>
The first two are meanings found in the Arabic language. The last four are all influenced by the language of the Philosphers and are unknown to the Arabic language, and they are used to deny something from what Allaah affirmed for Himself.    <P>
So the view of Ahl al-Sunnah is:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Tarkib (composition) in in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs is understood by the <u>first</u> and <u>second</u> meanings explainend above. See for example Surah al-Infitar (82:8), where Allaah mentions put together (rakkaba) man in whatever form He willed. Just like a garment is composed of different pieces. This is what is known.     <P>
As for the <u>third</u>, <u>fourth</u>, <u>fifth</u>, and <u>sixth </u>meanings they are all innovated meanings influenced by external philosophical concepts borrowed from the Greeks mainly. And the intent behind them all is to lay the foundation for rejecting Allaah's attributes and His 'uluww, as part of an innovated <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> which the Messengers never came with.   </blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Further Notes</font>    <P>
There are some other terms which have a direct connection to this term of tarkib used by the Innovators and they are <i>al-waahid</i>, <i>al-ahad</i> (meaning, one, singular). So what the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, intend by this is to arrive at the more pure and absolute notion of "oneness" such that no "composition" is involved at all. Now this type of idea of Allaah being "one" is something that only exists in the mind, not in external reality, since Allaah has an essence, He exists, that essence has attributes (and actions). The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said multiple attributes means multiplicity of essences which must all be eternal. So the Philosphers, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> argued with those who affirmed something of the Attributes, like the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, like <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, perceiving the inherent flaws in what the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were using as part of their proof of the universe being originated, began to borrow these arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> but apply them to subjects other than the attributes in order to fight against Ahl al-Sunnah. So <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> used it to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and he used the <u>third</u> definition above, whereas the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were using the fifth and sixth.</div>    <P>
Since the actual tools and resources of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are themselves, fundamentally, the tools and resources of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (both those ascribing to Islam and those not ascribing to Islam), it is not surprising that this same underlying foundation should make them all converge and gravitate towards each other and <i>become united in <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> either in whole or in part</i>, and in showing opposition and enmity towards Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">We caught out a neo-Jahmite pseudo-intellectual fraudster going by the name of <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> <u>red-handed</u> in using this particular doubt of tarkib and to see this clown's intellectual confusion, <b><a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>read this article</a></b> which is actually a summary article of six previous articles he was lashed with (all are linked to in the opening introduction). You can refer to that article for some more elaboration on this subject and see in more detail how this doubt is used by the Innovators carrying blood, puss and dung, pretending it is pure wholesome fresh milk.</font></blockquote> <P>
