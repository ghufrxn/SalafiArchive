<font class='titleHeadline'>Background Explanation</font>    <P>
<blockquote>On 5th April 2011 a statement of creed written by a charged up Barelwi Mullah with a chip on his shoulder called <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> who is upon the doctrines of the Ahl al-Kalam condemned by the Salaf was sent to us by email, with a request for a Sunni, Athari, Salafi response to it. Over the next 9 days, we wrote six articles (<a href=indexd293.html?ajona>Part 1</a>, <a href=index8379.html?rwbhe>Part 2</a>, <a href=index6dc9.html?gbokn>Part 3</a>, <a href=indexdcef.html?zyscp>Part 4</a>, <a href=index0fba.html?aesop>Part 5</a>, <a href=indexc546.html?alnor>Part 6</a>). On the <u>10th July 2011</u> we received an email containing a response by <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a>, which was supposedly a reply to our six articles. Being extremely busy we have not had time to give it a second glance until now (5th August 2011). As we have a spare hour or so, inshaa'Allaah we will write this article to clarify that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> has failed miserably in trying to disguise his creed which is founded upon the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> condemned by all the four Imaams and the Salaf as a whole. And more importantly, the fact that he used outright deception in his response, hoping that readers of his response will not go back and review our articles.    <P>
In his counter-response to our six-articles <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> has done an amazingly super job of <b>not addressing anything at all</b> in anything we wrote. <b>This is because he is unable, he knows it being the coward that he is, and hence, he resorted to deception and lies as we will demonstrate clearly and lucidly inshaa'Allaah</b>. The reason is because if he even tried to address the matters raised <u>with substance</u> and with sincerity, it would draw him into the discussion of matters that would expose <u>the true and real foundation</u> of the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis, which is the very same <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Hanafi and Rafidee <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> - all of which was condemned by the Salaf. This conceptual language in creed was simply borrowed from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who were speaking of theism and divinity through the language of bodies (ajsaam) and accidents (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) long before the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of Islaam came along and thought it was the best thing since the horse and cart. If <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> was honest and sincere and tried to address, in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>, whatever we explained in our response, it would open a "Pandora's box" to the audience who would subsequently come into historical details, facts and realities through which they would come to realize that Asrar Rashid's claims of following the Salaf are spurious, and he is simply a tail end of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> condemned by the Salaf. This would also in turn open upon another door of exploration with respect to a category of scholars associated mainly with study of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Hadeeth and Sunnah such as <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar and others, who, although never indulging fundamentally in <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (al-ajsaam wal-a'raad), became affected by something of it in their speech and writings.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is why people like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> have no option except to cling on to scholars like Imam <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, who  - as we have explained in our two detailed series on the Hellenized  nations who entered into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see here</a>) and on the slander of the allegation of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> against Ahl al-Sunnah (<a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>see here</a>) - tried to reconcile their main pre-occupation, which is the hadeeth and aathaar with the conclusions of the mutakallimeen, even if they themselves did not fundamentally delve into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> itself. This is characteristic of scholars like <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>. Thus, there exists speech from these Scholars which is of tactical benefit to the pseudo-Ash'aris and they use these statements as a stepping stone to the real hardcore <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology which they only teach in their private gatherings, circles and institutions, despite pretending openly, that they do not delve into the finer details of aqidah and that the way of the Salaf was not tafseel (detail) but ijmaal (generalization).</div>    <P>
Being unable to address anything at all, Asrar chose <b><u>one point</u></b> in our <a href=indexd293.html?ajona>first article</a> and used it as a means to deceive his audience, to make him think as if he has responded to our six articles and we shall explain that in what follows. </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary of the Barelwi's Initial Statement</font>    <P>
This was his initial statement of creed:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/asraar-rasheed-coventry-ash.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Asrar Rashid wrote:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...A [person] asked me to clarify my aqidah in the topic of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, so I say - and with Allaah, the Exalted, lies  success -:    <P>
Indeed, my aqidah in the topic of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is that which the majority of the Righteous Salaf, those for whom goodness has been testified, as occurs in the hadeeth, "<i>The best of generations is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them</i>." Indeed, the madhhab (way) of the Righteous Salaf is most knowledgeable, most precise, and most safe, being established upon the Book and the Sunnah, and it is that which the best of the Ummah and the most senior of the Scholars traversed upon.</blockquote>    <P>
Then in the rest of the statement all we have is the following:    <P>
<ul><li>A general statement regarding affirmation of "descriptions of perfection" (he did not use the word "attributes") reported in the Book and the Sunnah alongside negation of tashbih, tamthil, deficiencies and shortcomings.    <P>
<li>A repetition of the above stating again, the affirmation off what has been related whilist negating tashbih and mumaathalah, and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> aand <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, quoting the verse "There is no likenesss unto Him" and repeating again the negation of likeness, resemblance and so on and incorporating here the language of the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> or those influenced by it in negating from Allaah.    <P>
<li>Then he approached the subject of Allaah's ma'iyyah (Allaah being with the creation), and <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> in a few lines each, using the language of the people of kalam or those influenced by it.</ul>    <P>
As you can see, this is hardly anything of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> that would constitute a reasonable response to <u>a request to clarify one's creed in the matter of Tawhid</u>. It is generalities which the Ahl al-Bid'ah always use and rely upon in order not to give away the specific details of what they really believe and how it clashes with what the Salaf were upon. The presentation of creed with generalities is a tactical ploy used by the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. Once, victims have been entered into that circle, the specifics are then taught from the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> books of Ghazali, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, Sanussi and others - all of whom departed and abandoned what <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their earliest followers were upon.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary of our Detailed Response</font>    <P>
In our response, we intended to be brief and concise and we referred readers to other articles on the site for background information. Our response in those six articles (and the referred to articles) can be summarized as follows:    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> That the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) is the exact same kalam of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. This came into the Ummah through  the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and was passeed through them to the rest of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, including the Ash'aris and Maturidis. In our response to this Barelwi, we recommended the reader to study these two sets of articles which are necessary background reading:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> This language of bodies and accidents is found with the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. The <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in particular had a rational proof to demonstrate the universe has a beginning, and on account of which they were forced to speak of the creator with pure negations. This proof is what entered amongst the Muslims and it is called <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> al-ajsaam, or <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> al-a'raad fil-ajsaam or <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> <a href='tags/al-hawaadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hawaadith</font></a> fil-ajsaam. The underlying conceptual tools and language for this group is Hellenic, i.e. Greek, in particular the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>.  By using these conceptual tools and in order to remain consistent with this proof, all of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> gravitated towards the language of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in describing Allaah, the creator, but varying in the degree to which they were influenced. They were forced into this by the fact that the conceptual tools, language and terminology they used left them with no choice except to tend in this direction in order to maintain consistency. This is despite the fact that they were fighting and arguing with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> on other matters at the same time such as is the universe eternal, is there bodily resurrection and what is the nature of prophethood. Those who indulged in this "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" were condemned by the Salaf, those who spoke of <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions through these conceptual tools (bodies and their accidents, ajsaam and a'raad). As a result they departed from what the Companions, Tabi'een and Salaf were upon with respect to Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, His attributes, His speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and seeing Allaah in the Hereafter as well as other matters. This condemnation is agreed upon by all the Salaf, and the four Imaams, and all of the speech of the Salaf condemning "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is about this specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (not the genus of kalaam) and it is this very <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (proof of huduth al-ajsaam) that was inherited by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and <u>is found in all their works</u> and it is the foundation and basis of their opposition, enmity, slander and fabrication against Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the Salaf.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> In <a href=indexd293.html?ajona>Part 1</a>, we pointed out that Asrar Rashid's ascription to the Salaf is spurious and is only meant to deceive the audience, since anyone can string up generalized statements which <u>no one would disagree upon</u> and then claim one is truly following the Salaf whereas in reality, <b>in their private circles, gatherings and instutitions</b>, they qualify and specify those generalized statements (through the books of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, al-Sanussi, al-Ghazali) with what clearly clashes with what the Salaf were upon, and this is the tact that the Barelwi Mullah and the countless other dishonest deviants use to misguide others. So we indicate these are just public slogans and nothing more. We also indicated that the way of the Salaf was tafseel (detail) when  mentioning the and presenting their creed. <b>Note, this was the only point that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> chose to criticize from all of our six articles, and we shall highlight his great fraud in his criticism of this point further below</b>.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> In <a href=index8379.html?rwbhe>Part 2</a>, we pointed out how he never used the word "attributes" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) once in his initial statement of creed and instead chose to use other words and there is a particular reason for this, because it would cause problems for deviants like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> in their attempts to impose their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creed upon the general statements of the Salaf which they try to twist for their own ends. We also indicated that in order to convict <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> of his deviance and attempted fraud in creed and in the historical record one does not even need to recourse to the 70-80 books of the Salaf written on creed, one can simply go to the likes of <b><a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a></b> (see al-Asha'ri's Maqaalaat) and <b>al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee</b> (see his book, Fahm al-Qur'aan), and <b><a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></b> (see al-Maqaalaat, al-Ibaanah, and Risaalah Ilaa Ahl al-Thaghar) and <b>al-Baaqillaanee</b> (see at-Tamheed) and read about Ibn Mahdee al-Tabaree and Abu al-Abbaas al-Qalaanisee all of whom were upon the early Kullaabee-Ashari creed and who affirmed Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and His <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> dhaatiyyah in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who accused them of being <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> because of that. They affirmed meanings but denied takyif and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>, and they never allowed <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or tafweed in these particular matters. This is pure historical fact and record and cowards like <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> do not want to go there, because their fraud would be uncovered to the general public. We also indicated that when we look in the books of the Salaf and the books of the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> we find that they present their creed by being specific about what attributes they affirm and not suffice with just generalized statements.    <P>
<b>FIVE:</b> In <a href=index6dc9.html?gbokn>Part 3</a>, we exposed Asrar Rashid's attempts at camouflaging his <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creed through the use of the generalized statements of negation of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and exposed him, leaving him bare with nowhere to hide. This involved tracing the true and real origins of these negations to the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> creed that he is really operating upon, but trying to hide. We explained that when the Salaf make tanzeeh of Allaah (purify Allaah of defects) it is not the same as the tanzeeh of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, since they are operating upon a foreign, alien, Hellenized (Greek) conceptual language which came to them from the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who had already toyed with these conceptual tools before them in the matters of divinity, just go and ask <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>), they will teach you the same <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. We spoke in length on this matter and and we also brought statements from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> refuting the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah's allegation of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> against them because they affirmed the <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a>. No wonder he never came back to discuss in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> anything we raised.     <P>
<b>SIX:</b> In <a href=indexdcef.html?zyscp>Part 4</a>, we highlighted an error he made of making an absolute rejection of mushaabahah (resemblance) between Allaah and His creation and we quoted Fakhr al-Din <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> who acknowledged and affirmed that there are shared attributes between Allaah and the creation indicating that there is resemblance from some angles but not all. Then we expanded upon this matter in detail explaining the view of Ahl al-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf, and highlighted the error of the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who deviated away from the position of the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, let alone the way of the Salaf! <u>This is a matter of pure historical record</u>. There is also a good explanation of how there is not <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> at all in anything which Allah described Himself with, as that is impossible and hence, there is absolutely no caution in affirming whatever attributes have come in the Book and the Sunnah. This is very different to the way of the Ash'aris who presume there is tashbih in what Allaah has described Himself with and it is from this starting point that their methodology is founded upon.  Through this we established that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> is a liar in his claim of following the Salaf. Indeed, he would even be a liar if he claimed he was following <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, Ibn Mahdee al-Tabari and al-Harith al-Muhasibee, who are the early Kullaabi Ash'aris! We also quoted some important statements from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> in the article which prove that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> is spuriuos in his claim of following them, let alone the Salaf, and that he is on the side of the  <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as disputant against the Salaf and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> on the subject of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah (attributes pertaining to Allaah's essence that are only known through revealed texts).    <P>
<b>SEVEN:</b> In <a href=index0fba.html?aesop>Part 5</a>, we addressed the matter of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> which <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> only really alluded to without really committing himself to being very clear about it. This is the way of these conniving <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, they know that they can only deceive the people by non-specification and vague speech and generalizations. We highlighted and exposed the fact that Asrar Rashid's specific formulation of words in this matter is taken from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who used what essentially comes from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> [of how "the First Cause" is outside of "time and space"] to deny Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> (and also His attributes, specifically the sifat khabariyyah). We explained the false necessities that these people (<a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>) were operating upon which forced them to hold these views in order to remain consistent with their proof of <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> al-ajsaam which they took from the star and idol-worshipping Sabean pagans (<a href=index8a9e.html?uwfub >see here</a>). We also established that it is ijmaa' (concensus) of the Salaf that Allaah, Himself, is above the seven heavens above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and that the false necessities that these people speak of (that it necessitates confinement in space, <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and so on) do not apply to us because we are not operating upon the language and conceptual tools of a pagan star and idol-worshipper (<a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>) and we do not agree to that jurisdiction and thus whatever necessities are claimed <u>do not apply to us</u>, they only remain amongst the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, both the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (the Rafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the Karraamiyyah) amongst them and the Mu'attilah (Jahmiyyah,  <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah). Thus, we remain, upon the light of revelation, with pure wholesome milk, <a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a> without <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> and <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>.    <P>
<b>EIGHT:</b> In <a href=indexc546.html?alnor>Part 6</a>, we highlighted the issue of "jurisdiction" and that we as Ahl al-Sunnah, followers of the Salaf are not bound by the dung, puss and blood which is the conceptual language and baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, that of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad and the necessities following upon them. We explained that since we do not believe that such conceptual tools are permitted when speaking about Allaah, we therefore do not come under the jurisdiction of the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and hence, the Ahl al-Kalam cannot force their necessities up us, Ahl al-Sunnah, (as in if you say, for example, "Allaah is above His Throne", it means you are saying "He is confined in space") because we do not submit to and nor accept that jurisdiction or these necessities, rather we consider these necessities false and are unapplicable to Allaah, because there is nothing like unto Him. We also explained in other articles that they are the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> in truth, because in order to justify  their theological speech, they have to include Allalah within the genus of all created things in order to allow the necessities that apply to created things to also apply to Allaah such that they can say, for example, "If you say Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> it means He is confined in space." They can only make this judgement if they make a false analogy for Allaah (qiyas al-shumool, qiyas al-tamtheel) in that they treat Him like all created bodies such that the realities said of Him are the same as the realities of the creation. This is a very crucial matter to understand and it is elaborated upon <a href=articles/jbmfi-destroying-the-slander-of-tajsim-anthropomorphism-against-ahl-al-sunnah-wal-jamaaah-part-3.html>in this article</a>.     <P>
<b>NINE:</b> We also indicated through the articles we alluded to within our response and rebuttal of this Barelwi Mullah that their use of the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and others does not deceive us and we know exactly why they choose to use these particular Scholars as fronts for their deviant creed. We explained that there were scholars in this Ummah whose main pre-occupation was Sunnah and Hadeeth and they never fundamentally delved into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. Thus, you will not see in the books of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> what you see in the books of <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, or <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a>. However, because these scholars considered <u>the conclusions</u> of the Ahl al-Kalam to be correct, they tried to merge those conclusions with their knowledge of the Sunnah, and as a result fell into something of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and usage of some of this language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in their works. This is what happened to the Hanbali scholar <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> as well. As a result these scholars opposed the way of the Salaf in certain areas whilst agreeing with them in others, and they did contribute some good to the Prophetic Sunnah, in the sense that they aided it, and dedicated part of their lives to the hadeeth (unlike those engrossed in kalaam). For this reason, these scholars are a prime target and prime choice for today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as Ash'aris as a means of laying down the foundations for presenting and calling the people to their creed. Hence, they will start quoting from <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> as a precursor to what follows. So we already alluded to that in many of our articles previously, and lo and behold, the Barelwi Mullah, did exactly as we said when he came to write his counter-response to our six articles!   </blockquote>    <P>
It is important to keep all of this in mind as we now proceed to document and comment upon his counter-response inshaa'Allaah in <a href=indexca26.html?btogo >Part 2</a>, where we learn that <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> fled on his heels like a coward and did not address anything in <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> from all of what we have mentioned above and instead implemented a swindle on his audience, by pretending to refute us on an issue which is not even the issue of discussion, and to achieve that he played a sleight of hand on one sentence or expression which we used. Please proceed to <a href=indexca26.html?btogo >Part 2</a> to learn more about that.    <P>
