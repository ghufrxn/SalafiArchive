<p>All praise is due to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may the prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> The content of this article was previously provided as background information in dealing with a particular doubt of the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> regarding Allaah "encompassing" the creation. We have made this content as a separate article on this page - and as for the response to the doubt in question, <a href=index22f0.html?cvkis>you can refer to that here</a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Important Background Information That Has to <u>Always</u> Be Kept In Mind When Dealing With The Offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> And Their Doubts</font>    <P>
When dealing with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> in general, then you need to have a good framework in your mind to be able to understand what they are saying, why they are saying it and to immediately recognize the true nature and intent of what they are saying.    <P>
<b><u>Always Ask the Question: "Where Are They Coming From and Where Are They Leading To?"</u></b>    <P>
You have to know where a Jahmee is coming from, and where he is going towards. Or to put it another way, you need to known which door he has entered from, and which door is he desiring to exit from.    <P>
And in the sayings of the Salaf you always see the ability to succinctly and precisely describe a complex reality in just a few words, and before we bring a sample of such words that relate to the issue we are discussing and and which explain from where a Jahmee comes and to where he goes, we want to give a pictorial representation here for better understanding:    <P>
<u><b>The Four Doors</b></u>    <P>
You should imagine you are in a room which has two doors. One which is the entrance and the other which is the exit. But this room itself has two partitions, and in each partition there is a door. So we have four doors. One to enter the room, two in between, and one to exit the room. Now, here are the four doors:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/the-four-doors.gif border=0>    <P>
Now, the reality is more detailed and more complicated than this, there are a lot more doors but what we will do here is to represent the major issues of the entire situation.    <P>
So we have four doors:    <P>
<ul><li><b><u>The First Door:</u> The proof for demonstrating the createdness of the universe - this is the base and foundation</b></ul>     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now this door, once you enter into it, it is locked behind, you can't go back, you can't escape and you are forced to go through the rest. </div>    <P>
<a href=series/atomism-and-hudooth-ul-ajsaam-the-core-foundation-of--the-jahmite-ashari-religion.html>And we have covered this intellectual proof extensively</a>, and its called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" and you need to read upon this and be familiar with it. And the first to use such a proof was <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> against the Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (the Sumaniyyah), he argued on the basis that things we see around us have qualities (<u><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></u>), incidental attributes (<u><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></u>) and are subject to occurrences (<u>hawaadith</u>), they are by necessity, created. Then when those <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a> accepted this for argument's sake, they counter-argued and said "Can you see your Lord, or touch Him, or hear Him, or speak to Him or smell Him" and this is because they believed in only what can be perceived by the five senses, and they also believed in the transmigration of souls (which is similar but not the same as reincarnation). So, they confused Jahm and they also said to him, "Describe your Lord to us", and so Jahm got bewildered, how can he describe to these Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that Allaah hears, sees, speaks, loves, hates, becomes pleased, is above the heaven, and has the attributes of Face, Hands, Eyes and whatever else has come in the texts. So he went for forty days without praying because all of this put him into doubt.     <P>
So after reflecting upon how the Christians hold that their Lord indwells in some of His creation and addresses His creation through them but without Him being seen, he concocted a reply by which he could repel the doubt that those Indian <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> put him in and so quoting here the words of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in his book "ar-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah" (<a href=index7863.html?upfkv>see the full article here</a>), (p. 93 onwards):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Then he redressed [this defeat by devising] a proof similar to the heretics of the Christians. The heretics of the Christians claim that the spirit that is within <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (Jesus) is the spirit (rooh) of Allaah, from Allaah's Essence. So when He (Allaah) wants to bring about something, He enters into some of His creation and speaks upon the tongue of that (created person), and thus He commands with whatever He wills and forbids with whatever He wills. But is a spirit that is absent from (the people's) vision.    <P>
So Jahm devised a proof just like this one and so he said to the Sumaniyy: "Do you not claim that there is spirit (i.e. soul) within you? He said, "Yes." He (Jahm) said: "Have you seen your spirit?" He said, "No." He said: "Have you heard its speech?" He said, "No." He said: "Have you perceived it with the senses or been able to touch it?" He said, "No." So he (Jahm) said: Thus is Allaah, He has no face that can be seen, and no voice that can be heard, and no fragrance that can be smelt, and He is absent from (the people's) vision, and He is not in any one specific place exclusive to another..."    <P>
Thus, he instituted the religion of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>. And when people asked them about the verse, "<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>..." (42:11), what is its explanation (tafseer)? They would say:    <P>
<blockquote>"<b>There is nothing like unto Him</b>..." from amongst the things. And He is beneath the seven earths as He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, no place is devoid of Him, and He is not in any one specific place exlusive to another. He has not spoken and does not speak. He has not looked towards anyone in the world, and nor (will He) in the Hereafter. He is not described (with anything). He is not known by any attribute or any action. He has no limit (ghaayah) or end (muntahaa) (i.e. demarcation from what is besides Him). He is not grasped by the intellect. He is the face of all of it (i.e. existence). He is the knowledge of all of it. He is the hearing of all of it. He is the seeing of all of it. He is the light of all of it. He is the power of all of it. He is not two things. He is not described by two different descriptions. He does not have a "highest" and a "lowest" and nor directions or sides, neither a right nor left, and neither is He light nor heavy, and He does not have color, or a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and nor is He known (ma'loom) or understood (ma'qool). And everything that you (imagine) in your heart which is considered a "thing", then He is different to it.</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
So Jahm entered the first door and it was  locked behind him, because by virtue of this argument he employed against the <a href='tags/sumaniyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sumaniyyah</font></a>, he was bound to abide by all of its necessities and to treat it as the ultimate truth around which all other truth revolves - otherwise what he established against the Atheists of the existence of a creator through the createdness of the universe would be rendered false and invalid.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style='font-size:18px;line-height:25px'>Thus, the <u>entirety</u> of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (inclusive of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah) is all <u>focused around</u> and <u>directed towards</u> protecting this <u>intellectual proof first used by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (d. 128H)</u>. And this proof was refined by <u>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf (d. 235H), a head of the Mu'tazilah</u>, and this proof was taken from them by al <u>al-Baqillani (d. 403H)</u> who was the first to codify it and make it integral to what became identified as the deen of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> - even though Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> (d. 324H) himself considered this proof to be an innovation and prohibited its use.    <P>
And the bulk of what you find in the Ash'arite textbooks is the laying down of this intellectual proof using the notions of <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> (<a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>), <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle), <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (incidental attribute), <a href='tags/hudooth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth</font></a> and so on, and all of this is directed towards establishing the universe is created and therefore: a) that there must be a creator and therefore, b) that prophethood is plausible and possible and likewise, c) that resurrection is plausible and possible - and through this are the atheists combatted.    <P>
But this intellectual proof is <u>a corrupt one, it is flawed</u> and that is why amongst themselves they have so many differences regarding it's intricate details (that they do not reveal to the average Ash'ari) - and when the Atheist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> saw this corrupt and flawed intellectual proof, <u>they pounded the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and were given a field day against Islaam and the Muslims</u>, and they used this opportunity to bolster themselves in their claims that the universe is eternal and that there is no such thing as resurrection and that the Prophets only told lies and what their imaginations conjured up, and that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> can attain prophethood too.     <P>
Because when the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> opened up the door of <u>making <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the revealed texts that contradicted and invalidated their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</u>, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> said, "Why, thank you very much! <u>We are going to do the same with the texts relating to the creation of the universe and the resurrection</u> and we are going to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of them as well just like you have made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the texts of the attributes - so the universe is eternal, and there is no such thing as creation from nothing and no such thing as resurrection, and everything in the revealed texts regarding creation and resurrection, then its all figurative and is simply the use of metaphor!"</font></div>    <P>
So Jahm is the originator, the chief, the master, the flag-bearer, the imaam, the arch-Mu'attil, and he is the forerunner of the Mu'attilah after him. And as for his saying which amounts to:    <P>
<ul><li>Allah is in every place and in everything   <li>But at the same time not perceived by the senses   <li>And not described with anything that the creation is described with </ul>    <P>
<u>This is the foundation of all the misguidance in this subject</u> and from it do the fountains of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah spring. We will elaborate upon this  after we have discussed <u>the fourth door</u> as it is <u>a crucial part</u> of the whole picture.    <P>
<ul><li><b><u>The Second Door:</u> Rejecting that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the uncreated Speech of Allaah</b></ul>     <P>
So once the first door is open, you have to be brave, and show that you believe in your intellectual proof with firm resolution, that you are prepared to stand by it and not simply <u>run out</u> after the first door by trying to jump out of the window.     <P>
So Jahm made that firm resolve, and so he bravely and boldly walked through the second door, which is to say that Allaah never spoke to Moses direct and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. Why? Because all of it is supposed to be Allaah's speech, and if Allaah spoke words after having not spoken them, then that is an occurrence (haadithah) something that happened after it did not exist - and this is only found in created bodies, according to the intellectual proof - so the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, as we have it, must be created, it can't be Allaah's speech. So the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> either originated with Jibreel, or Muhammad (alayhis salaam) and it must be created. And in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we read, "<b>Allaah has heard the speech of she who disputes</b>..." (Mujaadilah 58:1), and Allaah could only have said this, 50,000 years after the decrees were written, and after the one who disputed was created, born, went through her childhood, youth and eventually to the point at which she "disputed", and if Allaah spoke after this, it means a "change" has occurred, because this is an occurrence, so this means, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> cannot really be Allaah's uncreated speech, it's got to be Jibreel's or Muhammad's and so this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we hear, memorize and recite, the wording of it, must be created and is not the actual word of Allaah.     <P>
And likewise, Allaah says, "<b>And Allaah spoke to Moses direct</b>...", and Allaah could only have spoken to Moses after  having written the decrees, at least 50,000 years after that, after the creation of the creation and then the creation of Moses, and his becoming a Prophet, and if Allaah spoke to Him, it means Allaah is subject to change, and events and thus, He must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that is created, and this falsifies the intellectual proof, and so Jahm rejected that Allaah spoke to Moses, and what he mean is that the Qur'aan is created, it is not the uncreated Speech of Allaah.    <P>
So we must say "The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have and recite and memorize, it is created" - otherwise it means that our proof against those Indian Materialist <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - and all other Atheists - will be falsified, and those atheists will be constantly making trips to "Accident and Emergency" to have their sides stitched back up on account of the severity of their laughter at us for employing an argument to demonstrate Allaah's existence which only proves, the opposite, that Allaah too is created and thus the non-existence of a supreme Creator.    <P>
And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> supported and took up this issue of the creation of the Qur'aan - because they took up the intellectual proof and they championed it - and they put the Ummah to trial with this saying of the Qur'aan being created, because to them it was kufr, it necessitated that if the Qur'aan was Allaah's Speech it would mean Allaah is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). And then <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) came along and he tried to reconcile between the view of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the people of the Sunnah and so he claimed that Allaah's speech is "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", i.e. that all of Allaah's speech inclusive of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has eternally been with Allaah in His Self, and it is uncreated, and so the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated too - and what he really means here is not the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have with us, but the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is part of that kalam nafsee that has eternally been with Allaah's Self. But this did not allow them to escape from saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have in our hands in the the mus.haf and which is recited and memorized is created, which is the reality of their saying. And this was taken up by the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, meaning the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and his followers.     <P>
<ul><li><b><u>The Third Door:</u> Denying that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter</b></ul>     <P>
Once you've gone through the second door, well why, you've just gone half-way, and if you've gone half way, it's not much harder to go through the other half and then those Indian Materialists - an all other Atheists - will realize for sure you are not some weakling who can be easily intimidated by their philosophy, so you've got to defend your intellectual proof against their doubts and counterclaims and you've got to now make the show of boldness and bravery and not be intimidated - so you pull your chin up,  walk through the third door and boldly deny that Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter. Why? Because seeing something means it must be in a direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>) and anything in direction must have a place (makaan) and anything in place must be necessity be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>thanks <a href="tags/aristotle.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Aristotle</font></a></a>, and <a href=index2cff.html?keedi>thanks again</a> - and thus if Allaah is to be seen by the people's vision of the eyes, then it means he is a body, and that falsifies our intellectual proof, and so we must reject Allaah being seen.    <P>
So the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> rejected it, and those after them, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> rejected it too, since their deen was also based around the same intellectual proof, and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> have words that approximate towards an affirmation of it, save that they introduced the sophistry of saying, "<u>but not in direction</u>", meaning that we want to combine between truth and falsehood, so we will say, "<i>Allaah can be seen</i>" (so we flee from the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and make it appear that we affirm Allaah will be seen) but "<i>not in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>)</i>" so at the same time we don't falsify our intellectual proof for demonstrating the universe is created.     <P>
So it doesn't matter if you have to invent positions which are impossible (seeing something with the vision of the eyes which is not in a direction!) because the most important thing is what? <u>Yes, to defend that intellectual proof for the createdness of the universe (<a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>), At all costs!</u> But when some of them realized that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> would mock them and throw rotten tomatoes at them for the poor and shoddy workmanship in crafting a worthy rational and intelligible position, realizing that what they were upon was nothing but sophistry, some of them began to say it is "a seeing of the heart", meaning in knowledge, and not an actual seeing with the eyes, whereas others maintained "but not in direction (<a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>)" because they had committed themselves to this point and could not turn back.    <P>
And all these antics were to maintain that intellectual proof of demonstrating the createdness of the universe and thus a Creator.  Now at the beginning the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> would not and could not say "There is nothing above the heaven", because this was plain manifest misguidance and disbelief, and so they raised the issues of the Qur'aan and the Ru'yah (Seeing Allaah) as they were not as manifest as the issue of Allaah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, above the Heaven. So these two doors are precursors to the fourth door.    <P>
<ul><li><b><u>The Fourth Door:</u> Rejecting Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, separate and distinct from it</b></ul>     <P>
Now this issue is <u>the greatest of issues</u> that <u>invalidates and falsifies the (corrupt, false) intellectual proof</u> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> and the Maturidiyyah for the existence of a creator - and note that we have excluded the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> because they affirmed Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, but they added some of their kalaamist influence and added phrases such as "without touching (i.e. the Throne)" and "without confinement" and so on, and they weren't so bold and adventurous in rejecting this outright, so they found a way to reconcile between affirming Allah to be above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, whilst negating from Him the necessities of created bodies - so as to not to falsify and invalidate their intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". And hence, their sayings such as "without touch", "without confinement", "without place" and so on and these phrases were an admission by them that Allaah is indeed above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, <u>with His Essence</u>, without that necessitating that He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>).    <P>
And there was no way for them to escape this creed because the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is contained in all revealed religions and all revealed books and was affirmed by all the Prophets and Messengers and it was the clear manifest deen of the Muslims, and it was the uncontested truth, and none rejected it save the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and it was known that anyone who rejected there is a Lord above the heaven is a kaafir - end of story - and all of this know and manifest in the books, and in what has been transmitted from the Salaf.     <P>
But the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> knew that this is the creed of the Muslims, and they could not come out openly in rejecting this, and so they were careful about this and only alluded to it or hinted towards it through other issues, such as the issue of the Qur'aan and the issue of Allaah being seen in the Hereafter.     <P>
<b>And at this point, we can now come to those sayings of the Salaf we mentioned earlier on, since the context has been set, those sayings of the Salaf that explain a complex set of events succinctly, briefly and concisely ...</b>    <P>

And the saying of Wahb bin Jareer (d. 206), from the leading Scholars of Basrah, as reported by adh-Dhahabi in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p. 170):    <P>

And these quotations are all from the Salaf who were alive during and after the mid second century (i.e. around 150H), after the emergence of Jahm and his followers, and so they realized what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were intending, through deduction, by their various other viewpoints. And this was a few centuries before what became known as the "Ash'ari" creed was ever known as such.    <P>

And there were a faction called the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who were <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphists</font></a>) and in refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> they said, "<u>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</u>", since they believed that for something to have an existence it must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and they said regarding Allaah "but not like the created bodies (ajsaam)", and so factions amongst them  made this qualification,  <a href=index264c.html?bolnh>so the real dispute with them on this issue was just a matter of wording</a>. And there is the view of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and followers that "<u>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</u>", and this saying was adopted by the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a>, like al-Baqillani, Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, and <a href='tags/abu-al-abbas-al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Abbas <a href="tags/al-qalanisi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Qalanisi</font></a></font></a> (a contemporary of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari).     <P>
<b>The point here</b> is that all those factions knew that Allaah is indeed above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> and the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> - because this was the manifest deen of the Muslims and the most clear, open, apparent,  plain obvious truth there is. But they spoke with statements that the Salaf never spoke with in attempting to defend this belief against the misguidance of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, so the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> said, "<i>He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with contact (mumaassah)</i>", and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said, "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without contact (mumaassah)</i>", and the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> said, "<i>He is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, without contact and without confinement</i>".    <P>
However, the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> were not satisfied that it can be simultaneously held that "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>" and "<i>He is not a body</i>", if Allaah was above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, above the Heaven, then it necessitates - according to them - that He is a body, confined in space - so therefore, <u>in order to protect that intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</u>, they had to go all the way and simply revert to the saying of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - and so the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> used the language of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> before them such as, "<i>He is not within the universe, nor outside of it, and nor attached to the universe or detached from it, and nor above or below</i> ..." and so on, directly opposing thereby what the <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> were upon (which was taken from <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> al-Basri).  </div>    <P>
So with these four doors you should now be clear that when you are addressing or being addressed by a Jahmee you know where he is coming from and where he is going towards - and don't be surprised if you are much better informed about his own reality than he is - because  most of these <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> <u>are completely and utterly clueless</u> - and we genuinely and sincerely feel sorry for them - they don't know whether they are coming or going and for what true underlying purpose they are arguing in the points of creed they are arguing - may Allaah guide them. This is a reality and the vast majority of them are blind to it. It's not their fault, they've been kept in this blindness because none of their teachers, mentors and shaykhs would dare reveal for what purpose they are making "<a href="tags/taweel.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ta'weel</font></a>" and "tafweed" and "tanzeeh" and why their whole deen revolves around "<a href="tags/jawhar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jawhar</font></a>", "<a href="tags/jism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jism</font></a>", "<a href="tags/arad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">'arad</font></a>", "<a href="tags/jihah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihah</font></a>", "makan", "tahayyuz" and so on. It's all about the intellectual proof - and ensuring that nothing in the Book and the Sunnah invalidates that proof - hence all speech about Allaah must be restricted, in its foundations, to these same terms and negation of them for Allaah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Sidenote on The Difference Between the Smart, Intelligent Jahmee and the Dumb, Dimwitted, Primitive Jahmee (Sudhajj)</b>    <P>
An example of your smart and intelligent Jahmee is <a href='tags/nuh-keller.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuh Keller</font></a>. This type of Jahmee keeps people occupied at the surface level of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed, and they don't really venture into the deeper elements because of their sure knowledge that when the average Ash'ari finds out about the true origins and nature of the creed of the Later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (an extension of the creed of the Jahmiyyah), then they will flee from it because they will see that it tends towards <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> as has been readily admitted by <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (df. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - <a href=series/imaams-of-the-later-asharis-our-creed-would-lead-the-common-folk-to-atheism.html>see here</a>. So these people are smart and they won't really allow themselves to get drawn into such issues in public because they know they would be entering into risky ground, and would be opening themselves up to vulnerabilities - so they keep a tight ship, and keep the discussion of all the philosophical Greco-Jahmic lingo and stuff in closed circles. It's a smart move.    <P>
Examples of your dumb, primitive Jahmee are the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> and the likes of <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>.

These primitive <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, it still hasn't clicked to them that if you were to take five pages of their talk, that "<i>Allah is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, and not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a> and not an arad and not in a makaan and not in a <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> and not inside the universe and not outside the universe</i>" and so on, and show it to your average Muslim of sound fitrah, and then take five pages containing the verses, ahaadeeth, sayings of the companions and the Imaams of the Salaf that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, the average Muslim would immediately know the truth that agrees with his fitrah is in the Book and the Sunnah and the sayings of the Salaf and the falsehood that is repulsive to his fitrah and which would amount to <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> is in the sayings of the pseudo-Sabean <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of the Greeks, and his fitrah would not hesitate in rejecting it.    <P>
So when we are dealing with these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who bring all these doubts such as "<i>when Allaah descends, does <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> become unoccupied of Him or not</i>", this is a Jahmee doubt, and likewise, "<i>if Allaah is above the creation, it must mean He surrounds and encompasses it just like a sphere contains another</i>" - then when you see people raising issues such as these, you should immediately know that these are the primitive, dumbwitted species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>. <u>They are like a child who is given a new toy with which he is overjoyed and excited and then he starts showing off with it in front of all the other children</u>. It's the same with your average wannabe Ash'ari <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Atomist who trolls blogs, forums and websites. He's picked up some of the Greco-Jahmite lingo, and is simply looking to flex a few neurons. So he brings out issues that the smarter Jahmees would not venture into. In reality this tactic is stupidity on behalf of these dimwitted <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a>, its not a good tactic - and the smarter <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> know this.    <P>
That's why your Nuh Kellers prefer to confuse people with things like "Imaam Ahmad did ta'weel", and "Imaam Bukhaari made ta'weel" and "Imaam Ahmad did some tafweed" and so on, and they research into and bring examples which they portray as <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed. The average Muslim's fitrah is not going to recognize truth or falsehood in these issues, and its easier to confuse them on these issues and make them think the way of the Salaf was other than what it really was. And thus, when the smart Jahmee has got you arguing about whether this Scholar or that Scholar did <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> or not, then he's diverted you away from looking at the root and foundation - which is their flawed, corrupt intellectual, rational proof. And we don't mean to say that we do not refute their false ta'weels and their claim of tafweed being the madhhab of the Salaf, certainly not, but we are speaking here of the shrewd Jahmees knowing how to keep the discussion focused in certain areas in order to not let the "cat out of the bag".    <P>
The dumbwitted <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, on the other than, tries to malign the truth that is established in the hearts of the common folk, that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, and they try to claim that this means "<i>Allaah is a sphere that contains another sphere that is the universe</i>", or that it means that "<i>because <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> is mighty, then Allaah too is Mighty and if He is Mighty it means He is <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> in parts</i>" and other such false necessities they try to ascribe to this belief - then the average Muslim will not fall for that, because he knows what the revealed texts speak with, and what the Companions expressed and what the leading Imaams spoke with cannot be falsehood, and his soul is not inclined to "<i>not a <a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>, not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, not an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>, not in <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a>, not in a makan, not inside the universe and not outside the universe, not touching the universe and not separate from it</i>" and all that stuff. They would not readily abandon that belief on account of these types of doubts, because the fitrah is a barrier to such falsehood and <u>the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> knew this</u>, so <a href=series/imaams-of-the-later-asharis-our-creed-would-lead-the-common-folk-to-atheism.html>they advocated what amounts to deception</a> in calling the general folk to the Ash'arite creed - and this is why we suspect every <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari, because we know for sure that he has come in through a particular door and he is wanting to depart through another door, and that there is more to his speech than meets the eye, and that he deems it permissible to outwardly speak with the apparent wording of what is in the revealed texts while inwardly rejecting it ...</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Motive of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) in Imposing False Necessities Upon The Revealed Texts And In Particular In Relation to Allaah Being Above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, With His Essence</font>    <P>
This should be clear now, the motive of the early <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> was to deny Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, they did not do that directly, and only hinted at it through the issues of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created and Allaah not being seen in the Hereafter, because by holding these beliefs, they managed to protect their intellectual proof for demonstrating the createdness of the universe. if the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was Allaah's speech it would be mean Allaah is subject to hawaadith (events, occurrences) and if Allaah can be seen in the Hereafter, only bodies can be seen and perceived with the senses, so Allaah must be a body, and this contradicts and invalidates their proof, so it must be negated, so Allaah can't be seen.    <P>
Now the two issues of the Qur'aan and Allaah being seen were not as apparent and manifest as the issue of Allaah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. Those two issues were a bit more intricate unlike the plain obviousness of the Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>. So the first of the issues the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> used in order to ensure their intellectual proof was not invalidated were the issues of the Qur'aan (being created) and Allaah not being seen in the Hereafter.    <P>
So these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, at the beginning, they were hinting at things regarding the issue of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, so from the things they raised and began to say were:    <P>
<ul><li>If Allaah descends to the lowest heaven, does He leave <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> or not?  <li> And if Allah leaves <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, does he enter the creation or not?  <li> We disbelieve in a Lord that moves from His place  <li> We disbelieve in a Lord that is one place exclusive to another  <li> ... and so on ...</ul>    <P>
And all of these are textually narrated about them from the Salaf. So these doubts and questions were being raised to deny that Allaah is above the heaven, and they were creating doubts and misconceptions in this regard.    <P>
<b>Why?</b>     <P>
Because this is <u>the greatest obstacle</u> and <u>the greatest affair</u> that demolishes and invalidates and stands in the way of their (corrupt and flawed) intellectual proof against the Atheists in their attempt to prove the existence of a Creator.    <P>
And because this matter of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, is settled in the hearts of the people and is from their fitrah, then the issue of Allaah being above the heaven is the arena for the greatest and most vicious battle between the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who want to argue that there is nothing above the heaven, and between the people of truth and faith who speak with what the revealed texts speak with, and with what all the Prophets and Messengers spoke with, and with what the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> spoke with and with what the Sunnah spoke with and with what the Companions spoke with and with what the entirety of the  Salaf spoke with and with what the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Early <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and many other factions spoke with, (alongside their unwarranted additional phrases).    <P>
So the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> prepare whatever they are able of doubts and misconceptions in order to corrupt the fitrah that is found in the hearts of the common folk, with a view to leading them towards their Greco-Jahmic formulations. And from such doubts is this one:     <P>
<blockquote>That if Allaah was above the creation, it means He must surround it like a sphere contains another sphere, and thus it means the creation is inside of Allaah. </blockquote>    <P>
And this is a new doubt, it is not narrated from any of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> prior to the 20th century from what we know - Allaah knows best.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Refer to <a href=index22f0.html?cvkis>this article</a> that deals with this doubt specifically.</div>   <P>
