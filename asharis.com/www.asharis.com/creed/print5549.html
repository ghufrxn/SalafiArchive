<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>In the second century hijrah a new theology entered the Muslims through the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and took the form of establishing a cause for the universe through a rational argument known as <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>.   The language and terminology underlying this theology was founded upon the conceptual baggage of a star-worshipping idolator called <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. By <u>the very nature</u> of the argument, only a certain type of deity could be affirmed, otherwise the proof would be invalidated and that deity had to be characterized through the same Aristotelian language or its necessities. This laid the foundation of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> whose foundations were then taken by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the Raafidah, and later, the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturdiyyah. They attempted to argue with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> through this conceptual baggage and as a result were forced, <i>by the very nature of the argument</i>, to assault the revealed texts with distortion. All of these factions were the ones intended by the Salaf's condemnation of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> (people of speculative theology). <b>Whilst they were the despised minority for the first four centuries, a faction amongst them (the Ash'arites) gained strength and prominence in the Muslim lands, gaining sway over regions and leaders during a three hundred year period from 400H to 700H</b>. They added elements to the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> school that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself was free and innocent of, from rejection of Allaah's <i><a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a></i> and the <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i>, entering into the ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, innovated form of tasawwuf coupled with wahdat ul-wujood, gnostic illuminism and so on.  When Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> came, he stood against these people, exposed their departure from the way of the Salaf, aided the way of the Salaf and <u>reconnected the Ummah back to the way of the Salaf</u>.  Both during the life-time of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) and afterwards many lies, fabrications and slanders were spread about him for obvious reasons. Many hateful, resentful, envious <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> passed in history, some of them with scholarly standing, who spread doubts (of varying levels of sophistication) against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. <b>One of the most striking things about all of this is that the enemies of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in his time actually <u>acknowledged his honesty, integrity and trustworthiness and his accuracy in citation and memorization</u>.</b> What they took issue was his criticism and refutation of their doctrines and traditions (that had no basis in the religion) which they could not stomach. You have to keep this in mind for this article.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nizar-hammadi-tunisia.jpg align=right style="border-radius:6px;margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" border="1" width="200" border=0>With that said, we are going to discuss the claim of an individual by the name of Nizar Hammaadi, a Tunisian <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>.  With the knowledge that the majority of his audience does not have the means to independently verify his claims, he spreads vicious lies and untruths. The case we are going to take up today involves an attempted defence of <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) from an accurate observation made about him by Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on the issue of the origination of the universe. <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a> attempts to cast doubt upon the integrity of Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in quotation and attribution of viewpoints.     <P>
</blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background</font>    <P>
<blockquote>We have spoken extensively on this website about the foundation of <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-kalam</font></a> which is proving the universe to be originated through an argument expressed through the language of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a>. The argument is that attributes (<i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i>) and events (<i>hawaadith</i>) in bodies (<i>ajsaam</i>) are evidence of those bodies being originated (<i>haadithah</i>), and upon the corrupt and false principle of "<i>the impossibility of an endless chain of events</i>" the sum whole of all bodies present in the universe can be said to have been originated, leading to an originating cause. The very nature of this argument requires that no "<i>act of creation</i>" could have taken place which is attributable to the cause identified through the argument. Further, this argument requires a particular type of description of the deity (otherwise the proof is invalidated). From here, the symbols of Islamic belief were eroded by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the second century hijrah (in order to make the revealed texts compatible with this argument) and this activity was continued by the later ones, the Ash'aris and Maturidis. These later ones made a pretence of outward affirmation (of attributes) through word-play and definition, but agreed inwardly and in reality with their predecessors, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. From those symbols were the <i><a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a></i> of Allaah, His <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i>, His speech (<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>), His <i>ru'yah</i> on the Day of Judgement and other affairs.    <P>
When the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (<a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>) such as al-Farabi and <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> saw them arguing in this way, they saw the flaws in the argument and embarked upon debates which would play out over the next few centuries. Because the proof used by the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> is flawed and corrupt, it could be used to argue the exact opposite, to establish that "<i>no act of creation</i>" took place, that the universe is caused by the mere essence of the first cause, and that the universe is therefore eternal alongside that first cause. The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> wrangled in this issue and gave incoherent answers, even though they were closer to the truth. By the time the later ones came along such as <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H) and Sayf al-Din <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a> (d. 631H) and looked at all the arguments and counter-arguments for each view, <b>they became confused and bewildered</b>. It is here that a phrase was employed (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1603;&#1575;&#1601;&#1572; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1583;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), <i>equivalence of evidences</i>, to describe a position that was resigned to by these bewildered people and it means that the arguments for the universe (matter) being originated and eternal were equal in strength. Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> referred to this on numerous occasions in his works with respect to <b><a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a></b>. He indicated that because this proof is corrupt and false, it allowed the enemies of Islaam from the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> to attack Islam through the incorrect views of these Mutakallimeen, leading to wrangling in debate over centuries, leading to confusion and bewilderment.     <P>
Let us look at the quote used by <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a> to malign <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (and note the way it has been translated by them into English). In the book <i>al-Tis'eeniyyah</i> (p. 773) <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> says (our translation):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it has been said that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> affirmed the (position of) (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1603;&#1575;&#1601;&#1572; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1583;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) <i>equivalence of evidences</i> and that can be given consideration through <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> for he in this (matter) - and it is the matter of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies) - mentions the evidences of both parties and he explicitly states at the end of his book and at the end of his life, and this is the book <i>"Mataalib al-Aaliyah</i>" with (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1603;&#1575;&#1601;&#1572; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1583;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) <i>equivalence of evidences</i> and that this issue is from those that bewilder the minds (intellects).</blockquote>     Once this is clear we can now move to <u>the crime scene</u>. A crime was committed by the resentful and dishonest <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a>, who is from Tunisia and is taken as a shaykh who is studied under. This was posted on one of the Arabic forums and was subsequently translated into English and spread.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Crime Scence</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nizar-hammadi-razi-takafu.png border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Analaysis</font>    <P>
We can do this in numerous points:    <P>
<b>01.</b> We have frequently mentioned in our articles a general rule of thumb, <u>a theorem</u>, that one must hold onto, which is "<i><b>never, ever trust a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> in citation</b></i>." This theorem has been arrived at through the scientific method and the following observational data: Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>). When it is the case that all of these individuals have to defend a theology whose origins lie with the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and <u>ultimately</u> in the conceptual  baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> (whose language and terminology formed the basis of kalam theology) against the theology of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and the Salaf of the first three generations, then one has to be very careful in verifying what is claimed by these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> <u>when they quote and cite</u>, because such a false creed can only be propped up by lies and distortions. And what we are going to present below is an excellent illustration of this.    <P>
<b>02.</b> That which is established from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in all his works is that the greatest of people in doubt and confusion are the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalam</font></a> and this is especially so with people like <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> in whose works one can see utter, mass confusion. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> often points this out in his works indicating <u>a)</u> the contradictions in al-Razi's polemics such as arguing for a matter in one book and then refuting it in another (and vice versa) or <u>b)</u> that he will bring powerful rebuttals against a position (held by him) then bring very weak arguments to defend it or <u>c)</u> at times he will mention conflicting evidences essentially validating both without clarifying the matter and stating it is just way too difficult to really resolve. This latter one is what we find in <i>Mataalib al-Aaliyah</i>, in the fourth volume, in which he is discussing the origination or eternality of bodies (the universe).      <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-cover.jpg align=right style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px" border="1" width="200" border=0><b>03. </b> To the right you can see the cover for the fourth volume of <i>Mataalib al-Aaaliyah</i>, one of the very last books by <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a>. The approach we are going to take today is represented by the <b>zoom out method</b>. This means we will look at the quote used by the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> (<a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a>) to malign <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, then <u>zoom out</u> a little so we can see what is on the page, then <u>zoom out</u> a little more so we can see what is in the entire chapter. Then <u>zoom out</u> a lot more so that we can see what is in the rest of the book. By zooming out in a step-wise fashion, we will start seeing the bigger picture and the fraud of <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a> will be complete and all that will remain thereafter inshaa'Allaah, is just another empty-handed, empty-pocketed resentful <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> hater who is better off kicking stones in back-alleys than spreading lies against pious Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
<b>05.</b> Before we bring the the actual quote in <i>Mataalib al-Aaliyah</i>, let us make sure we understand the issue here. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> mentions the uncertainty of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> in that he brings evidences of both parties, those who say the universe is originated and those who say it is eternal, and that he affirms the position of equivalence with respect to them in the book in question. In response, <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a> alleges that this is a lie upon <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and that <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> was merely quoting a statement of Galen, to whom this view is attributed. This therefore is a proof that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> was dishonest and lied upon <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>. That's the essence of the matter. In addition to this, it should also be pointed out that none of the adversaries of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> actually questioned his honesty and integrity in quoting and citation. In fact many of them acknowledged the vastness and superiority of his intellectual capacity over them, and this is found mentioned in the biographical accounts provided by <a href='tags/al-dhahabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Dhahabi</font></a> amongst others.     <P>
<b>06.</b> So let's proceed to look at the actual quote brought by Nizar Hammaadi to construct his cheap attempt at maligning Ibn Taymiyyah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-27a.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the fifth category: It is withholding (hesitancy), without (claiming) certainty. This is quoted from Galen,, for it is related from him that he said to some of his students during the illness in which he died, "<i>Write from me: I do not know whether the universe is originated or eternal and that I do not know whether the soul is a state of mind or not a state of mind</i>." And there are some people who have made this a revilement upon him and said, "<i>He left the world just as he entered it, not knowing these things</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
We have a number of things here: Pay attention to the following things which become apparent from this paragraph. <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Razi</font></a> mentions "<i>the fifth category</i>" which means there must be four others. Further, he does indeed quote Galen. And this is the only thing mentioned by <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a>. But we see what appears to be a defence of Galen by <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> when he says, "<i>And there are some people who have made this a revilement upon him.</i>" So straight away we see that there is more to the story that this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> hater has not revealed (on purpose of course). So lets <b>zoom out</b> a little more.    <P>
<b>07.</b> If we look at the sentence that comes immediately after, we now start seeing a slightly bigger and different picture:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-27b.jpg border=0>    <P>
The second paragraph translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And we say: This is from the most evident of evidences to show that the man was just, a seeker of truth. For speech in this matter has reached such difficulty and cumbersomeness that most of the intellects fade away therein. And Allaah knows best.</blockquote>    <P>
Now it becomes clear that <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> is actually defending Galen and is claiming that Galen's position is "<i>just</i>" and shows "<i>seeking of truth</i>", this being justified because the issue is one of "<i>great difficulty</i>", difficult for most of the intellects. Now, lets <b>zoom out</b> a little more and go to the opening of this chapter on page 19 and see what we can pick out from there.    <P>
<b>08.</b> This still leaves the question of those four other categories unanswered, so lets investigate them. At the beginning of the chapter we see the following:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-19.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The Third Introduction Regarding an Explanation of the Doctrinal Views of the People Regarding this Matter</b>    <P>
Know there is no doubt that this perceived material world is a body (<i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i>) described with specific attributes and that this body is matter (<i>maaddah</i>) and those attributes are form (<i>soorah</i>). So we say: The universe is either originated in both is matter and form, or it is eternal in both its matter and form, or it is eternal in its matter, originated in its form, or it its originated in its matter and eternal in its form. Or (a person) withholds from these (four) categories (of possibility). So these are the available possibilities in this matter.</blockquote>    <P>
So now the larger picture is starting to emerge. It is clear that after discussing each of these four scenarios, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> finished by discussing <u>the fifth position</u> of withholding and being uncertain, and he cited Galen in this and then essentially praised this position, justifying it and defending Galen against criticism. What this begins to reveal is the actual conclusion being presented in the book as a whole which is that due to the extreme difficulty in this matter, the most praiseworthy stance is to withhold and not be certain either way. That <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> mentions the evidences for both sides does not mean he is arguing for either, rather, he is simply compiling all the evidences out of comprehensiveness, and even if he may incline to one view, he acknowledges the actual evidences are so strong and equivalent in strength that they do not allow certainty to be had. This is a clear indication of doubt and uncertainty. Now lets <b>zoom out</b> a little more.     <P>
<b>09.</b> If we move to the very next chapter after the quote in question regarding Galen, in the fourth introduction, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> has a chapter titled, "<b>Regarding the [Issue] of The Divine Books Establishing the Origination of the Universe</b>" and his first statement in this chapter is (<a href=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-19.jpg>see entire page</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is not in the Divine Books an explicit affirmation of the universe being originated, in both its matter and form. And the corroboration of this matter is that the words present in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that inform of this meaning are numerable (countable)...</blockquote>    <P>
Then <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> goes through each of these words one by one and claims that not a single one of these words can be used to prove that the unniverse was originated (in matter and form), and these words are: <b>rabb</b> (lord), <b>khalq</b> (creating), <b>faatir</b> (originator), <b>ghaniyy</b> (free of need), <b>awwal</b> (the first), <b>kun</b> (be). After explaining away every single one of these words, he then says (p. 32):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it is established from this that there is nothing in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> what indicates the origination of the entities.</blockquote>    <P>
Then he makes a citation from the Tawrah to prove the same, and after that he says:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-32.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it is established from these explanations that there is not a word in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or the Tawrah which indicates explicitly that these entities are originated after being non-existent, coming to be after they were pure negation and pure nothingness. And there is no doubt that these two Books are the greatest of the Divine Books, so when these two books are devoid of explicitly (making reference to) this desired objective, then it has given the presumption that this matter has reached difficulty until it actually turned into one of difficulty.    <P>
If a person says: Prophethood is a branch of Divinity, hence whoever spoke of the eternity of the universe, revilement of Divinity is binding upon him, so how can affirmation of prophethood be in harmony with that? Then we say to the one who says that the essences are eternal: We are not inferring from the (mere) presence of those essences for the presence of the powerful, wise deity. Rather, we say that those essences vary in their attributes. Some of them are sparse and high and some of them are dense and low, their variation in these attributes must be due to a (an entity with) power and choice (<i>qaadir</i>, <i>mukhtaar</i>). When the existence of a deity is established through this route then it is possible to branch off the saying of Prophethood through it. <b>And from what we have mentioned (here) it can be established that: The greatest of the Prophets (salawaatallaahi alayhim) remained silent away from disputing  about this matter. And this indicates that it has reached such a level of difficulty that human intellects are rendered incapable of reaching (at the truth) therein. Allaah knows best</b>.</blockquote>     <P>
Allaahu Akbar! He first invalidates all those words that can be used to show that the matter of the universe had a beginning [<b>rabb</b> (lord), <b>khalq</b> (creating), <b>faatir</b> (originator), <b>ghaniyy</b> (free of need), <b>awwal</b> (the first), <b>kun</b> (be)], then he raises the issue of the implication this has on arguing for Prophethood (which is dependent upon the universe having a beginning) and in response he simply  brings the argument originated by the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> such as <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> of <i>al-Takhsis</i> (specification), in that the variation of attributes in entities proves a creator. Those <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> did not like the method of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> and devised their own methods of proving a creator such as those of <i><a href='tags/al-tarkib.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-tarkib</font></a></i> and <i>al-takhsis</i> (alongside which one can maintain an eternal universe) and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> actually uses and implements both of these arguments in his works, something for which he was criticized and reviled by other As'harites such as Muhammad al-Sanusi (<a href=indexe49c.html?axxnv>see this article for example</a>). And here we see him arguing that even if the bodies are proven to be eternal that in no way affects our ability to argue for  a creator, because we can use the argument of <i>al-takhsis</i> (specification). Also note what he says at the end of the above quote, "<i><b>And from what we have mentioned (here) it can be established that: The greatest of the Prophets (salawaatallaahi alayhim) remained silent away from disputing  about this matter. And this indicates that it has reached such a level of difficulty that human intellects are rendered incapable of reaching (at the truth) therein. Allaah knows best</b></i>" which is explicit in stating that Prophets never spoke about this matter at all (let alone clarified it) and that it is something the truth of which the human intellects can never arrive at! See quotes below from Ibn Hajar and Muhammad al-Sanusi. The matter by  now is very clear, but we can <b>zoom out</b> a little more and finish off with a couple more revealing quotes from the book.    <P>
<b>10.</b> When we look at the contents pages we see that the entire volume is on the topic of the evidences for those who say the universe is eternal and the evidences of those who say the universe is originated. After discussing some basic foundations in the first 40 pages, he embarks in the rest of the book to look at the evidences of each side. The evidences for the universe being eternal start on page 41 and end on page 239. In the final chapter related to evidences for the universe being eternal, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> brings an objection brought by those who say it is originated. He says (p. 231):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that those who speak with origination say: If the universe had been eternal it would be free of need of a causing agent and this necessitates the negation of a creator completely, and then they argued for the validity of their saying that if the universe was eternal, it would be free of need of a causing agent, elaborating upon their saying with a proof and an example...</blockquote>    <P>
In the rest of the chapter <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> presents and covers the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (Hukumaa) against this claim and after bringing fourteen counter-arguments against those who say the universe is originated he concludes at the end saying:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-239.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And this is a definitive evidence proving that the caused (ma'lool) being in need of a cause (illah) is not dependent upon the caused being originated.</blockquote>    <P>
He intends by this to validate the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that a simultaneous cause and effect relationship (without the effect being delayed from the cause at all, rather being simultaneous) does not require or depend upon the effect itself being originated. Rather a cause and effect relationship can exist without this condition. And <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> describes the proof demonstrated by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> as a <i>burhaan qaati'</i> (definitive, decisive evidence).    <P>
<b>11.</b> As for the arguments of those who argue for the origination of the universe, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> discusses them from page 241 onwards and a large part of it is take up to discuss the proof for the universe arising due to an entity that has power and choice (<i>qaadir</i>, <i>mukhtaar</i>) rather than it's presence being necessitated by the essence of an eternal entity (mujab bil-dhaat). After this he covers some miscellaneous issues pertaining to the view of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and other factions. Now of course <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, in this book as well as others, mentions the evidences for the origination of the universe. However, the point is that when you look at the volume as a whole and you see what he has really done and where he has left the reader and what he himself says clearly in various parts, it all indicates his doubt and uncertainty and the reality of the affair becomes clear.     <P>
What this shows is the great dishonesty of <a href='tags/nizar-hammadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nizar Hammadi</font></a>, it is deliberate and intended. If all you were able to do is to cite just the statement of Galen, and you neglected to mention everything else (whether it is on the same page, or in the same chapter or what is in the rest of the book), then you have established yourself a dishonest liar and a cheap one at that!    <P>
<b>12. </b> At the very end of the book, after his discussion of all of the various arguments <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> says (p. 426):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-matalib-aliyah-4-426.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that when these doctrinal schools are summarized from this angle, and the praiseworthy and blameworthy elements of each one of them becomes apparent, then it is here that the people of bewilderment and perplexity say: "<i>These evidences have not reached clarity and strength to a degree that removes doubt and cuts off the excuse and fills the intellect with their light and strength. Rather, every one of them has an element of obscurity</i>." And it is befitting for the all-Merciful (al-Raheem) and the Generous (al-Kareem) that he pardons the one who errs in the likes of these difficult areas. </blockquote>    <P>
<b>13.</b> It is very clear from what has preceded that <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> presents, with strength, the arguments of those who say the universe is eternal, he presents all the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who counterargue against the arguments of those who say it is originated and gives them support through his own words. Just as he also presents the arguments of those who say the universe is originated but undermines them in certain ways, and he invalidates the Qur'anic evidences indicating the universe is originated by explaining away terms such as <i>rabb</i>, <i>khalq</i>, <i>faatir</i> and so on. Ibn Taymiyyah's characterization of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> is extremely accurate, and this is not the only incident in which the superiority of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in accuracy and his shining honesty is apparent. There are many others, the example from <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> regarding <i><a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a></i> (<a href=index1780.html?aioth>read here</a>), and also a citation from <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> from his <i>Maqaalaat</i> in which <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> points out the error of Ibn al-Fawrak in wrongful quotation (we have alluded to this in some articles), and also his accuracy in citation from al-Ibaanah of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> as it pertains to the attribute of eyes (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>). The examples are in fact abundant and a separate article would be needed to give brief coverage to this issue. However, as we said before, none of the adversaries of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> were so bold as to question his integrity. In fact many of them acknowledged his towering superiority over them in numerous fields of knowledge and acquaintance. These types of attacks upon <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> only came when uncouth, foul-mouthed, fanatical pseudo-scholars appeared on the scene in the 20th century such as Muhammad Zahid <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> and whoever followed in his path of academic fraud.     <P>

That's what <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> does in many of his works! And that is exactly what he has done in <i>Mataalib al-Aaliyah</i>, and resigning to the position that this is an extremely difficult matter in which a person could be excused because it bewilders the mind. Does the issue of whether the universe (in matter and form) is originated confuse and bewilder minds? When Allaah is the Rabb, the Khaaliq and the Faatir, these names make it apparent and clear that everything besides Allaah is originated and came to be after its own non-existence. Through this alone it is known that all arguments to the contrary are futile. And that's all that the average Muslim needs to know. But when you get into this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> and abandon the Book and the Sunnah, this is the evil end that these people are led to. They wasted their entire lives in conceptual nonsense only to learn, at the very end of their lives, that barren old village women are firmer and sounder in religion (due to remaining upon the <i>fitrah</i>) than these (people of kalaam) ever were through their pseudo-intellectual babble.    <P>
<b>15.</b> In <i>Sharh al-Sanusiyyah al-Kubraa</i>, the later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar Muhammad al-Sanusi (d. 895H) says, criticising <a href='tags/fakhr-al-din-al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr al-Din <a href="tags/al-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Razi</font></a></font></a>   (<a href=indexe49c.html?axxnv>see this article for documentation</a>):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it could be plausible that the reason for his (al-Razi's) supplication with this is what he knew of his condition of craving to memorize the opinions of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the People of Desires and propagation of their doubts and his strengthening their citation alongside his weakness in determining the reply to many of them - based upon what is apparent from his authorship.

<b>16.</b> Compare the position of <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> to that which is crystal clear in all the books of Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (such as <i>al-Safadiyyah</i>, <i>Bayaan Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</i>, <i>al-Nubuwwaat</i>, <i>Dar al-Ta'aarud</i> and many others) in which he demolishes <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a>, Ibn Rushd and others in their claim that something eternal can be present alongside Allaah, the Sublime. As an example, in <i>Bayan Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</i> (2/462 onwards) <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> addresses the claim of Ibn Rushd that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> indicates that time measurement (zamaan) is perpetual in both directions (past and present) by saying:    <P>
