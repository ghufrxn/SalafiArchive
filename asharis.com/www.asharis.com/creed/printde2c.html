<div class="articleContent">






<p>All praise is due to Allah and may the prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger to proceed:     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
In six previous articles we documented, exposed and sent to the dustbin of history, a vile slander perpetrated by a <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> going by the name of <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> who parades himself as a highly-charged pro-Ash'ari Kalam Atomist guru in front of a gullible, ill-informed audience that is deluded by his sophistry. In reality he should be paraded through the streets and markets on the back of a donkey and beaten with palm leaves and shoes for two reasons:     <P>
<blockquote>a) Defrauding his followers into thinking he is an erudite kalam guru, when he is nothing short of a deluded primary school child unable to distinguish between the arguments of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> (who are his enemies) from those of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (to whom he belongs), and:    <P>
b) Making takfir of the righteous scholars on the basis of doctrines built upon Aristotle's definitions of place (makaan), space-occupation (tahayyuz) and body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>see here</a>.</blockquote>    <P>
Today we are going to go further in our actions of benevolence towards this Jahmee and <u>write out a recommended and approved repentance for him which he is ordered to sign, publish and distribute</u> in order to save him from ignominy in front of his followers when they realize he is defrauding them and is not really the highly charged pro-Asha'ri kalam atomist guru he is making himself out to be - let alone the ignominy of having to face one's slanders and takfir of the Allaah-fearing scholars in the Hereafter.     <P>
It's best in these types of situations to come out clean. An open repentance and mending of one's ways is a reasonable calculation that would help to maintain whatever status one may already hold in the eyes of a deluded and ill-informed audience and is much better than becoming the exemplification of he about whom Allaah said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And recite (O Muhammad) to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Signs but he threw them away, so Shaytaan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray. And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire. So his description is the description of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out. Such is the description of the people who reject Our Signs So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect. (al-A'raaf 7:175-176) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Now this first repentance  might be hard to swallow for Abu Adam, but its advisable that he rushes and gets himself over it - because all the other repentances that we are also going to write for him will become a little easier. The first one might appear uphill, but it really is all downhill once you get over it.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Little Background and History For the Record</font>    <P>
Before proceeding to the text of the repentance, we need a little recap of recent history for those who are not familiar with the situation:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The Disciplining of the Jahmee Baleed</b>    <P>
<ul><li> First response to Naruiji's claim that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> holds Allaah to be <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> and <a href='tags/divisible.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>divisible</font></a> (into parts) - (<a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>read article here</a>).  <li> Acknowledgment of the Jahmee of his treachery in quoting the words of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> - (<a href=index0edf.html?bcnnu>read article here</a>).  <li> Clarification of what is intended by the likes of <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> by the terms "al-Waahid" and "al-Ahad" and "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>"  - it is nothing but the underlying argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that the Ash'aris are supposed to reject as implying pure <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> - but which is nevertheless employed by <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> to deny Allaah is above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> - (<a href=index725d.html?vvitd>read article here</a>).  <li> <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explicitly negating and rejecting composition and divisibility for Allaah - Part 1 - (<a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>read article here</a>).  <li> <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explicitly negating and rejecting composition and divisibility for Allaah - Part 2 - (<a href=index11b6.html?iwemr>read article here</a>). And after these articles the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> was forced to acknowledge that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> indeed rejects the meanings of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a> (divisibility) upon their established meanings in the language of the Qur'aan and the language of the Arabs. And when the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> was forced to acknowledge this he then claimed that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has two different sets of definitions for these terms (tarkeeb, inqisaam) and that he rejects one of them for Allaah but affirms the other as and when it suits him - and he invented this explanation to help him maintain his slander.  <li> Sending the Jahmee hurtling into the stratosphere through the refutation of Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (d. 895H) against the proof of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" used by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - which is the very one that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> used against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and which the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> employed to justify his slander against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> - (<a href=index9dd0.html?dhptx>read article here</a>).  </ul></div>    <P>

<div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'>  <div style="font-family:courier new;font-size:17px;">  From: <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>     <P>
To whom it may concern from amongst my students, followers, and the generality of the Muslims:    <P>
I recently accused <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> of affirming composition and divisibility into "quantitative parts" for Allaah on the basis of a statement of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, the text of which is:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/btj-3-440-quote.gif border=0>    <P>
I have now come to realize that this statement is made by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in the course of refuting an argument borrowed by <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> in order to deny Allaah being above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
I inferred from this statement (from my understanding) that:     <P>
<blockquote>Ibn Taymiyyah is saying that there is no proof for the impossibility of Allaah being described with what <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> claims to be "tarkeeb (composition through parts)"</blockquote>    <P>
And on this basis I accused <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> of stating explicitly that Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (i.e. made up of parts). Leaving my treachery in quoting to one side, I now realize this is a gross error for reasons that will be clarified below. I also claimed on the basis of this same statement that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is essentially saying that nothing can exist, not even Allaah, without parts (ajzaa') that are in need (iftiqaar). I now realize that this claim regarding this statement of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is totally false and baseless for reasons that will be clarified below.    <P>
After making my baseless allegation based upon this statement of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd>it was brought to my attention</a> by those good, benevolent folks over at <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com <a href=index5ff2.html?jqphd >in the first of their Sunni responses</a> to my <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> meanderings that I had misunderstood the words of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
In their first response - besides my treachery in quotation which I was later forced to acknowledge and correct - they clarified that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> explicitly negates "composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>)", "divisibility (inqisaam, tajazzee)" for Allah in clear, unambiguous words and that the problem he has with the argument of <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> is that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is simply employing the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> which is the proof of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition). This proof of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is used to establish the existence of a Maker, and on account of it they were forced to deny all the Attributes, because affirming attributes for the Maker would have necessitated according to their proof that Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>), being made up of parts (ajzaa') that are in need (muftaqirah) of the whole.     <P>
And those good folks at <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com brought statements from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that explained that what is intended by such a proof is to negate the notion of distinction such as what is found between Allaah's Attributes in that His hearing is other than His seeing, which are both other than His speech and so on. And even if this is deceptively labelled as "tarkeeb (composition)" it is obligatory to accept and affirm this meaning for every existing thing, the Creator and the created - because there is nothing in existence except that it is described with  multiple distinct attributes.    <P>
Despite all these clarifications, my crippled and defunct intellect betrayed me and refused to accept this explanation of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that was presented to me in clear unambiguous statements from the "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>". In fact, even after they brought another three articles (<a href=index5fe7.html?ljtge>here</a>, <a href=index11b6.html?iwemr>here</a> and <a href=index725d.html?vvitd>here</a>) on the subject of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> and <a href='tags/inqisaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>inqisaam</font></a>, making the issue as clear as the sun in a cloudless sky, my decrepit intellect continued to betray me and the education and training of my kalam atomist teachers over there in Syria and Kuwait availed me nothing. I continued to insist and persist. This led me in a childish fit of anger and frustration to write a new article (dated 25th August 2009) re-asserting the very same allegation against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and insisting on my (false and baseless) reading and understanding of the quotation in question.    <P>
It wasn't until those good folks at <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com pointed out what has been written by <a href=index9dd0.html?dhptx>Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href="tags/as-sanusi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">as-Sanusi</font></a></a> (d. 895H) who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar whose books are standard texts in <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> dogma, and a work of whom I have myself translated. This scholar wrote on this exact same subject regarding <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and his affectations towards the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their argument of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> being deceived by them, and when I read his words <a href=index9dd0.html?dhptx>it was then that I finally woke from oblivion and understood</a>, finally, what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> was talking about.    <P>
So what I now understand and what I hold on this issue is:    <P>
<ul><li> The Philosopher's argument for a Maker for the universe is what is called "proof through composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>)". The essence of this proof is that created bodies in the universe (ajsaam) are composed (murakkabah) and anything that is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> is in need (muftaqir) of its parts (ajzaa'), and everything that is needy (muftaqir) then its existence is only possible (as opposed to necessary), and that whose existence is only possible must have an agent whose existence is necessary. And numerousness (kathrah) in the essence (dhaat) of that whose existence is necessary is impossible, since that necessitates that it is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) and has need (muftaqir), and this contradicts its necessary existence.    <P>
<li> Both Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> - in the many quotations brought by those good folks at <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com - and likewise Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a>, a prominent later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, are refuting this argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> which has simply been employed, unscrupulously, by <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a>, and which he was clearly affected by.    <P>
<li> I acknowledge that <a href=  index9dd0.html?dhptx>what Muhammad bin Yusuf <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> wrote between pages 118-121 of his Sharh al-Kubraa</a> is in fact <u>exactly the same</u> as what <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> wrote in the quoted passage that I used to slander him. Since, the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> argue that attributes are distinct parts (ajzaa') within the Essence, and hence, <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition) is necessitated. <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> is  using the "proof through <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition)" argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, which to us Ash'aris necessitates outright kufr and <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atheism</font></a> - and he is using it to deny Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, arguing that this necessitates Allaah is <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> through parts.    <P>
<li>Ibn Taymiyyah's argument against <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is that we reject for Allaah the meanings of the words "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" and "<a href="tags/inqisaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">inqisaam</font></a>" and "iftiqaar" that are well-known and established in the language. As for what you are trying to do, which is to include meanings of truth (Allaah being above the Throne) into these terms, and then demand that these terms are rejected outright - which would include negation of a true meaning established in the texts, and agreed upon by the Salaf in their entirety and likewise by the prominent early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> as well as many other factions - then we are not falling for that deception because what you are doing here is based upon the argument of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who reject all of Allaah's attributes in their entirety because in their view this necessitates that Allaah is composed (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>) of distinct parts (ajzaa') which are in need (muftaqirah), thereby making Allaah's necessary existence to be impossible. So <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is saying that this thing that you O Razi are calling "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>", then there is no proof that it is impossible at all. Rather to deny this and claim that this is impossible is pure sophistry - since there is nothing in existence except that it is described with multiple attributes.    <P>
<li> And I acknowledge that after providing a refutation of the "proof of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition)" used by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to deny the attributes, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> writes (Sharh al-Kubraa, p. 119):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sharf ud-Din Ibn at-Tilmisani said: And when al-Fakhr [ud-Din ar-Razi] believed the correctness of this proof, meaning the doubt of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> that "al-iftiqaar" - with the meaning of unrestricted need  - necessitates (only) the possibility (of existence), and that every composed (thing) is in need of its (<a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>) part (juz') and (in need of) the part that is other than it, and that anything that is need of what is besides it cannot (have) except a possible (existence), and (the doubt of) the presumption of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) [for Allaah] through consideration of the attributes - [so <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, believing in the correctness of all that] when he used these precepts in seeking evidence for the possibility (of existence) of everything that is besides Allaah, the Exalted, he perceived (that this also meant) the invalidation of the attributes of Allaah, the Exalted. So on one occasion he (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>) said, "<i>This is from (amongst those affairs) in which we beseech Allaah, the Exalted, for counsel</i>"...</blockquote>    <P>
And he also says (p. 120):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And what has led him (i.e. ar-Razi) to most of these corrupt views is fleeing entirely from "at-tarkeeb" (composition) which the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> have presumed to be binding from the affirmation of the attributes, and for that reason, they negated them - whilst (we should note) that something does not increase (numerically) on account of the numerousness of its attributes and nor does it increase (numerically) on account of the numerousness of its considered qualities (such as hearing, seeing, speaking).</blockquote>    <P>
And he also says (p. 120):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sharf ud-Din bin at-Tilmisani said: And at-Tarkeeb (composition) in [Allaah's} Essence is binding upon him (<a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>) as well, because the quiddity (the true essence of a thing) of every attribute amongst life (al-hayaat), knowledge (al-ilm), power (al-qudrah), will (al-iraadah) are distinguished (mutamayyizah) from the others in the mind. From them are those that have no connection (to others) such as life (al-hayaat), and from them are those that do have connection, but do not have influence (upon other things) such as knowledge (al-ilm). And from them are those which are connected and also have influence such as power (al-qudrah) and will (al-iraadah). So when they are distinguished (from each other) and are different (to each other in Allaah's Essence), they (the Attributes) necessitate different aspects in that which is required for them (to exist) [meaning Allaah's Essence], and when the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> realized that, then it was not possible for them except to deny the attributes, and so they deceived the Muslims in applying them (to Allaah) whilst negating their realities (haqaa'iq), and they explained them (the attributes) with affairs that are different to their true essence - such as their explanation of His being knowing (aalim) as meaning "He is not a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) or established within a body (meaning He is not a body or an incidental attribute of a body)"...</blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that this doubt is the very one that misled the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to reject all the attributes, and it misled the Imaam, al-Fakhr (ud-Din ar-Razi) until he said what he said, and Allaah guides whomever He wills to the right path.</blockquote>    <P>
<li> That <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> (who is one of my scholars) are on one side of the line in this issue of the "proof of <a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a> (composition)", and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is on the other side of the line with those "evil, nasty, heretical, deviant" <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> - and I decided to stand by <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> on the side of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, by considering their underlying argument of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" to be the truth in the course of my slander of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. Woe to me, and woe to me again!    <P>
<li> That my attempt to claim that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has two different meanings for "composition" and "divisibility", and that he denies one but affirms the other, is just  mere sophistry and an outright fraud. Rather, there is only the known, clear and established meanings for these terms in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs. As for the second meaning that I am trying to claim <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> does not deny, then it is a meaning concocted in the minds of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and in the mind of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> who claimed that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> means that part of Him is distinguishable from another and He is therefore <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> (<a href='tags/murakkab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>murakkab</font></a>). And this meaning was fabricated in the mind of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and he tried to impute this meaning to anyone who spoke in affirmation of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and did not agree with the necessities of this proof through "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" (composition) that originated with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.      <P>
<li> And I acknowledge that it is <u>outright hypocrisy</u> for me to not permit my opponent to use that very same response and rebuttal that I use against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> to rebut the very allegation that I also make against my opponent.</ul>    <P>
And in light of what has become clear to me, I state in all seriousness and earnestness:    <P>
<ul><li>I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do repent from my slander against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on this issue, and when it is the case that it is haraam in Islaam to lie upon and slander a pagan (despite his shirk), or an atheist philosopher (despite his kufr) - since the repugnance of what they are upon, and hatred of them, does not make it lawful in the Sharee'ah to lie and slander them - and as a very large and significant body of the Ummah hold <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in high esteem and recognized his stature, erudition and piety - then it is certainly not permissible for me to let loose my tongue upon him with scandalous intellectual frauds and deceptions merely because I have hatred of him. Thus, I announce my repentance and ask forgiveness from Allaah for my iniquities.    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do repent from supporting the corrupt proof of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, the "proof through composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>)" against the truth that was clarified by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (d. 728H) and after him, <a href='tags/as-sanusi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>as-Sanusi</font></a> (d. 895H), who is one of the <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> of the later times. For grievously odious it is that I put on a display of refuting those "vile, nasty, evil" <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> with one face, and then with another face use their very same arguments to make takfir of Allaah-fearing scholars. The hypocrisy in this would be similar to me using the arguments outlined by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> which are, at the very same time, also a refutation of my own creed. And this clearly is hypocrisy and dishonesty of the highest order.    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do repent from defrauding my students, followers (and RSS subscribers) into thinking that I am some sort of highly-charged, erudite, pro-Ash'ari, kalam atomist guru. It is clear that I have still not learned the very basics as evidenced by the fact that I fell prey to the arguments of those "nasty, vile, evil" <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of which I am supposed to be an avowed enemy. And this is besides the dishonesty and lack of integrity displayed in quoting and conveying the statements of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do repent from my implied slander upon the early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> such as Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, al-Qadi <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr <a href="tags/al-baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a></font></a>, Ibn Mahdi <a href='tags/at-tabari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Tabari</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-al-abbas-al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Abbas <a href="tags/al-qalanisi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Qalanisi</font></a></font></a> and others (<a href=index24b1.html?ddxry>see here</a>) all of whom held Allaah to be above the heaven, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without that necessitating that He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body) confined in space - rather they affirmed His <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, with His Essence, whilst negating <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>, and thus, I do not consider it far removed that I would be able to accept this one day - when I have cleansed myself of the impurities of tajahhum.    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do make hasty repentance for claiming - on account of considering <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and his arguments to be correct - that Allaah spoke manifest clear kufr when He said - upon what is apparent in the Arabic language - "<b>ar-Rahman ascended above the Throne</b>", and likewise, clear manifest kufr when He said, "<b>And He is al-Qaahir, above His servants</b>", and likewise, clear manifest kufr when He said, "<b>And the Angels and the Ruh ascend to Him </b>..." and clear manifest kufr when He said, "... <b>rather, He raised him (<a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>) up unto Himself</b> ..." and clear manifest kufr  when He said, "...<b>they fear their Lord from above them</b>..." - and thereafter <u>not onc</u>e did Allaah reveal to His Prophet that the apparent meanings were not intended. Instead Allaah inspired the Prophet with multitudes of statements in the Sunnah only corroborating and affirming that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, and using language that could only possibly lead those hearing them to conclude conclusively that Allaah is above the creation, above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence. And thereafter, [my claim that] the Prophet, never once explained to the Companions that the apparentness of all of that is not what is intended, and that taking all of that upon its apparent meaning is kufr. And thereafter, [my claim that] the Companions continued to transmit all of that, without ever once explaining that the apparent meaning, that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with His Essence, is not what is intended. So I repent from claiming all of this, and my viewpoint by necessity meant that I claim all these repugnant things regarding Allaah's Book and the Prophet's Sunnah - that they comprise what is essentially kufr.    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, do admit to <u>one agonizing thing that I must absolutely come to terms with</u>, which is that if I am going to persist in my slander of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> on this issue then I must accuse the aforementioned early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> of <u>what is far worse</u>. Rather, I have to accuse them of two things     <P>
<blockquote>a) their being gross <a href='tags/anthropomorphists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphists</font></a> for affirming Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with His Essence, since according to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, just the mere affirmation of Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> necessitates composition and divisibility into parts and     <P>
b) their falling into a ridiculous contradiction when they held that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>and</u> is not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) - for this, according to <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, is impossible</blockquote>    <P>
<li> I, <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a>, am faced with the prospect of having to admit in this regard that the Anthropomorphist <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> were more rationally sound and intellectually consistent in their view that "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)</i>" than were the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> in their view that "<i>Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and not a body</i>". Thus, I have yet to resolve this agony in my mind as to who to pledge allegiance with:    <P>
<ul><li>Should it be with <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and those "nasty, evil, vile" <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their "proof of composition (<a href='tags/tarkeeb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tarkeeb</font></a>)" which necessitates that Allaah being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> must make Him a body, there being no escaping from this conclusion. This option is clearly not available to me since I am repenting from this very thing which I used to slander Ibn Taymiyyah!    <P>
<li>Or should it be with those Anthropomorphist <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> who I have to admit were rationally more sound and consistent in their saying - even if I do not accept it - that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>). Because this view, upon the arguments of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, is more rational and sound.    <P>
<li>Or should it be with those early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who - if I was to accept and persist upon ar-Razi's argument against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> through the proof of "<a href="tags/tarkeeb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tarkeeb</font></a>" - would be considered to be the worst of all three factions for falling into what amounts to sophistry, namely, claiming that Allaah is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, but  not a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>)! So they fell into <a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a> <u>and</u> that which is a contradiction!</ul>    <P>
This is my dilemma!  </ul>    <P>
Finally I say: O He who revealed about Himself in His Book:     <P>
<blockquote>He who is above the Heaven, and He to whom both the Angels and the goodly word ascend, and He who raised <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> unto Himself, and He who sends down the revelation upon whomever He wills from His servants, and He who is feared by His servants from above them, and He who ascended above His <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></blockquote>    <P>
I turn to you and I beseech you to forgive me for the aforementioned iniquities, that you save me from the mires of tajahhum and that you guide my heart to find the creed of the early <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> to be more agreeable than the Jahmee and Mu'tazilee creed of the later <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> that has led me to into this disgrace, and perhaps through that transition I may come a step closer to adopting the creed of the Salaf wholeheartedly. Ameen.  <BR><BR>    <P>

So this repentance which we have written for <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> is one more act of benevolence for which we seek no thanks, and it is requested that the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> take this matter seriously, to give it some serious consideration, and to give sincerity of purpose to his Lord, before a day when neither wealth or offspring and neither <a href='tags/kalam-atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalam <a href="tags/atomism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Atomism</font></a></font></a> or <a href=indexa9d4.html?glwlf>Aristotle's definition</a> of "makaan" will avail him of anything.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>More Kindness and Benevolence - Free of Charge</font>    <P>
As yet another and further act of kindness and benevolence, we have ensured that the burden of sin and iniquity of this <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> is reduced by engineering the following:    <P>

This way, people will not be misled by his scandals and frauds, and this will no doubt relieve him of a great deal of the burden of sin that would otherwise be found on his shoulders. It is clear to us that he does not seriously understand what he is getting himself involved in.     <P>

In closing, we urge <a href='tags/naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Naruiji</font></a> to sign this repentance as quickly as possible, to spread and distribute it and to notify us so we can update this page accordingly - before what is inevitable catches up with him, and refuge is with Allaah. <P>
