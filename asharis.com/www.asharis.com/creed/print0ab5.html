<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Various Manuscript of <a href="tags/al-ibanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ibanah</font></a></font>    <P>
Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Mahmud points out four manuscripts in her 1397H (1973CE) print edition of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> and labels them as (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>), (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;</span>), (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1586;</span>), (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1583;</span>).    <P>
First lets list brief details of each one (refer to pages 187-192 in her introduction):    <P>
<ol><li> <b>The Alexandrian Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>)</b><BR>  This does not have any date (!), and nor the name of who made the mansucript copy (!), it is in much better  condition than the rest. Strangely, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> decided to use this as the foundation, even after admitting its been tampered with and has had insertions from people with Mu'tazili (read As'hari) orientations.    <P>
<li> <b>Maktabah al-Azhar Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1586;</span>)</b><BR>  It is dated 1307H, and it is written at the end of it, "<i>And it has been written by the slave to his Lord, making tawassul to the Prophet, al-Udnani Muhammad, Muhammad al-Hameedaani...</i>" This is a strong indication that this copy is by an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Sufi. This mansucript has clear legible writing and is missing some things not which Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> explains as either omitted them, or the copy he used was itself damaged in certain places.    <P>
<li> <b>The Maktabah Koshak Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;</span>)</b><BR>  It is written at the front of this manuscript "From the books of the needy, Isma'il Uthman Pasha in the year 1154, the month of Shawwal" showing it' posession, and at the end of the manuscript it indicates that the manuscript copy was written in 1084H.    <P>
<li> <b>The Dar al-Kutub al-Misriyyah Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1583;</span>)</b><BR>  This is dated 1307H, on the first page it has the seal for the waqf of Ahmad bin Isma'il bin Muhammad Taymur in the year 1321H. This manuscript is preceded by al-Risalah Fi al-Dhabb anil-Ash'ari by Abul-Qasim Abd al-Malik bin Isa bin Darbaas (d. 659H) - which is a book written to defend <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> from the claims of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and those who claim al-Ashari wrote it out of deception, without believing its contents.  </ol>    <P>
After providing these details, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> explains:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-intro-p-19.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... it  has become clear to me that the manuscript of Maktabah al-Azhar al-Sharif which I have indicated with (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1586;</span>), and the manuscript of Rayfan Koshak (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;</span>) and the manuscript of Dar al-Kutub al-Misriyyah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1583;</span>) are approximate to each other from the angle ofo the order of the text, and the differences between them are little. And that is in opposition to the Alexandrian city manuscript, which I have designated with (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) , and which is free of many of the impairments (damage, gaps) which are found in the other three manuscripts, with complete passages in some instances.</blockquote>     <P>
This indicates that the manuscript which does not have any date(!) or any name(!) is different to the rest all of which are similar in their sequence and order of events.  Now we need to pay attention what Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> has said about this mansucript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>)!    <P>
  <font class='titleHeadline'>Ash'ari Tamperings of the Alexandrian Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>)</font>    <P>
Dr. Fawqiyah said on p. 188 of the introduction:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-intro-p-188.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And I have  considered it (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) to be the main, root manuscript because it is absent taqdim (advancement) and ta'khir (delay) that is devoid of meaning, and it does not have impairments (damage, gaps. etc.) which are of <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> as opposed to the other manuscripts and also  because its manuscript copier was precise in the words to a great extent ...</blockquote>    <P>
First of all this is a very poor reason for considering this manuscript to be the base and foundation, especially considering it has no date(!) and its manuscript copier is unnamed and unknown (!) and it appears to be much more recent than the other three because it is in  much better condition. However, pay very close attention to what she reveals straight afterwards:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Except that it is necessary to be noted what it contains of additional [insertions] which require close scrutiny, in order to disqualify what has been attached to it of fabricated expressions (ibaaraat madsoosah). </blockquote>    <P>
She admits that this manuscript has fabricated additions, and then states:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>For it has become apparent [in this manuscript] - even though these [fabricated] additions generally support the orientation of the Salaf - [such] statement(s) that opposes this general orientation ...</blockquote>    <P>
After admitting fabrications in this manuscript, she states that the nature and orientation of these fabrications are in line with the orientation of the Salaf (!) even if in their details they  they oppose the way of the Salaf - it does not really make sense to even say this, it is redundant and meaningless, as we shall see from the examples that Dr. Fawqiyah herself brings. In essence, she is using this manuscript as the root and basis and is forced to reveal that it has been tampered with, and is trying to downplay this fact, however it is very hard to do this, and she maintains her academic integrity by indicating documenting such tamperings, so straight after she gives examples:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>An example of that is what is found in page 81 (of the manuscript) in explanation of al-Istiwa in that it is a with al-qahr (domination, subduing) and al-qudrah (power). So this statement, definitely, by all means it is in the hand of one of the readers of the  manuscript who is inclined towards I'tizaal and from those who at the same time are ignorant of the reality of the affairs and what confirms, supports this ...</blockquote>    <P>
Allahu Akbar! When she says "inclined towards I'tizaal" this is none other than an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> who is following the approach of al-Baghdadi (d. 429H) and al-Juwayni (d. 478H) and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and al-Razi (d. 606H) who took the way of I'tizal regarding these attributes of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, 'Uluww, Face, Hands, Eyes... and in any case, what would a Mu'tazili gain out of tampering with <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>? So this handiwork is certainly that of an later <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> As'hari. Then she gives another example:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and what confirms, supports this  is the comment on page 82 (of the manuscript), whose text is:     <P>
<blockquote>Pause over this chapter, for the author has taken liberties in bringing these expressions, they explicitly indicate directions (jihaat) and <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (bodily form) by inclusion (dimniyyan), so reflect</blockquote>    <P>
This speech here indicates that its author inclines towards absolute tanzih which the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> speak of and which results in negation of the attributes, in the manner that we have explained previously, in particular. And that adhering to the orientation of the Salaf with respect to these [fabricated] additions is plain to every scrutinizing researcher.  </blockquote>    <P>
This absolute tanzih is what the later As'arites tended towards in negating what the early Kullabi Ash'aris affirmed. So we have a second example of what is most certainly the attempt of an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> trying to tamper with the text and add his own explanation to it.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Examples of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Tamperings in the Alexandrian Manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>)</font>    <P>
Let's take a look now at some of these fabricated additions occuring in this undated (!) manuscript copy with unnamed writer (!)    <P>
<b><u>1st Example of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Tampering of al-Ibaanah</u></b>    <P>
Here on page 107:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-p-107.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In the three manuscripts (which are certainly the older ones which have had more wear and tear and which should have been considered the foundation) there occurs in:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allah is ascended over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, which is above the heavens, and if Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, had not been upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, they would not have raised their hands towards the Throne</blockquote>    <P>
And Dr. Fawqiyah points out in the footnote at the bottom:  <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>  What is in between the brackets in [manuscript] (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) is the following:    <P>
<blockquote>...with an istiwa' with the meaning of al-qahr (subduing) and al-ghalabah (domination), and if Allah had not made istiwa over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> with the meaning which He intended, the Most High, they would not have raised their hands towards <a href="tags/the-throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a></blockquote>    <P>
And this expression is confusing in meaning.</blockquote>    <P>
As you can see, this is a clear example of <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> tampering and fabrication upon al-Ibaanah, and the explanation of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> with al-qahr and al-ghalabah (over the Throne) is the interpretation of the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who took it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. The verifier, Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> DID NOT include this wording in the main text indicating that they are clear FABRICATIONS upon the text.     <P>
<b><u>2nd Example of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Tampering of al-Ibaanah</u></b>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-p-21.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
 First of all notice that the large paragraph (point no. 27) is found only in the undated (!) manuscript copy (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) with an unnamed, unknown manuscript copy writer (!), and it is different to the other three manuscripts which Dr. Fawqiyah points out at the bottom. In the other three manuscripts there occcurs only the following:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And Allah is ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, just as He said, "<b>the Most Merciful ascended over the Throne</b>."</blockquote>    <P>
As for the lengthy paragraph, guess where it is taken from? Yes, lifted straight out of one of al-Ghazali's works (!!!!!) and then again (!!!!!).     <P>
<img src=assets/images/ghazali-arbain-fi-usul-al-d.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=1 border=0>Here is the book "<b>Al-Arba'een Fi Usool al-Deen</b>" of <a href='tags/abu-hamid-al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hamid <a href="tags/al-ghazali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ghazali</font></a></font></a> (d. 606H), and it is edited by Abdullah al-Urwaani and Muhammad al-Shaqafah, printed by Darl al-Qalam, their first edition (2003).     <P>
Have a look at what is on page 18-19 and read the entire thing, then go back and read what is in the undated, tampered with, manuscript copy (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) which Dr. Fawqiyah explicitly stated has fabricated insertions (madsoosah) from people with an I'tizaali (read bigoted later Ash'ari) orientation. The entire paragraph from beginning to end is <b>actually identical to the letter</b> to the fabricated insertion in manuscript copy (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>).    <P>
<u>This leaves absolutely no doubt whatsoever</u> that manuscript copy (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) is tampered with, unreliable, undated copy which has been butchered by a bigoted <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, here is the quote from al-Ghazali:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ghazali-arbain-istiwa-p-18.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Allaahu Akbar! This fraud that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> have been peddling regarding the so-called tampering with <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, trying to ascribe this to Ahl al-Sunnah has fallen back upon them and it is established that it was most certainly a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> who has been tampering with the original al-Ibaanah.    <P>
<b><u>3rd Example of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Tampering of al-Ibaanah</u></b>    <P>
And another example of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> tampering in manuscript copy (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-p-126.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In this example we see a clear example of attempted <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> distortion in the unreliable, doctored manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>)  where they have poisoned the text with the insertion  of the ta'wil of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> of yad (hand) to qudrah (power). After the mention that Allaah created Adam, and garden of 'Adan, and wrote the Torah with his Hand, the statement:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Meaning, through the hand of his power, the Sublime</blockquote>    <P>
is missing in all the other manuscript and is found only in the undated(!), manuscript (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) with unnamed and unknown manuscript writer(!). This is clearly an attempt to explain away the attribute upon the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> which all the early Kullabis and <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> refuted, such as <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> (see <a href=indexc56a.html?xsjgs>here</a> and <a href=indexbd8e.html?ezymy>here</a>).    <P>
And what proves this is a fabricated insertion into al-Ibaanah is that a few pages later al-Ash'arite refutes the ta'wil of hand to power (qudrah) in detail:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-tampering-refute-tawil-hand.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
This is just part of much of what is found in refuting the Jahmee, Mu'tazili ta'wil of hand and it is refuted also by <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
It is very clear, by way of what Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> revealed, who was very honest in pointing out what she did - despite showing an inclination to the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> way - that it is the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who have tried to doctor the text of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, and even if she did not point to an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> culprit, but simply said that it is someone "<i>inclined towards I'tizal</i>."  In reality, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> from the time of al-Juwayni all inclined towards I'tizal, as is not hidden, and it is only they who have a clear operative motive for wanting to discredit al-Ibaanah or at least to doctor its contents, particularly in relation <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and the Sifat Khabariyyah.    <P>
