<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif align=right border=0><BR><BR>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Before reading this article do your homework by going <a href=index04ad.html?jrqmv>here</a> and <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>here</a> and also make sure you know your species of Jahmee by going <a href=index958b.html?aujtf>here</a>.</div>    <P>
We covered <a href=index04ad.html?jrqmv>in a previous article</a> how the defeated, gutter press Jahmee, in his bankruptcy, attempted to use the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> al-Asqalaani (rahimahullaah) regarding the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (Allaah's descent in a manner that befits His Majesty, without <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> or tamtheel) and said that "Ibn Hajr does not believe Allaah is in a direction". Thus, he is using <u>the saying of <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> as a piece of evidence</u> and as part of his proof. And we explained that <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> is from the 8th century after hijrah, and that <u>the bankrupt Jahmee could not find anything from the first few centuries to support his Jahmee beliefs</u> and that <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> was affected by something of the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, whilst not being upon their usool (foundations)  and for this reason, he made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, as well as using some of the innovated language of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> in affirming or denying for Allaah, such as <a href='tags/jihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihah</font></a> and makaan and so on.    <P>
And now the <a href='tags/jahmee-baleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmee Baleed</font></a> has brought - guess who - yes, its Imaam <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-Nawawi</font></a> (rahimahullaah) who died in 676H (7th century) who was also affected by the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> and the madhhab of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed.    <P>
Here is the Jahmee's article title:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/naruiji-nawawi-location-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In short whatever can be said here is the same as what was said  <a href=index04ad.html?jrqmv>in the previous article</a> regarding <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> (rahimahullaah). He tried to get out of the ditch with that one, and we can simply push him back down again with that same article for most part, which is that the bankrupt Jahmee can't find anything from before the year 300H from any of the Salaf with an authentic isnaad to support this Jahmee belief of his of negating their is a deity above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, with <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> being a true and real created entity.     <P>
The two quotes he brought from <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-Nawawi</font></a> (regarding the attributes in general and of <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> as an example in particular) can be summarized as:    <P>
<ul><li> That the way of the Salaf and some of the Mutakallimeen was to affirm that there is a meaning but that they do not know it and to leave it to Allaah, without delving into it - and this is tafweed.    <P>
<li> That the way of the Salaf and some of the Mutakallimeen was to make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of these texts in accordance with the language and the context of their mention, giving the example of the alleged ta'weels of the descent by the Salaf to His mercy, or command descending.</ul>    <P>
Regarding the first claim then sufficient is it to render it invalid that it has been reported from a large number of the mufassireen and the people of knowledge of the Salaf that they made tafseer (explained the meaning) of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> with "'alaa" and "irtafa'a", meaning rose or ascended over. And this is <u>tafseer of the  ma'naa</u> and it is regarding this that Imaam Maalik said that <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> is "ma'loom (known)" and "ghayr majhool (not unknown)". And sufficient is it that they (the Salaf) declared the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as kaafirs for denying there is a Lord above the Heaven, and sufficient is it that all the following (by way of example only):    <P>
<ul><li>Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181H)  <li> Abdullah bin Abi Ja'far <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. after 200H)  <li> Hishaam bin Ubaydullaah <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 221H)  <li> Saneed bin Dawud al-Maseesee (d. 226H)  <li> <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal (d. 241H)  <li> Yahyaa bin Mu'aadh <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 258H)  <li> Al-Muzani (d. 264H), the companion of ash-Shafi'i  <li> Abu Zur'ah <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 264H)  <li> Abu Hatim <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 277H)  <li> Ibn Abee Shaybah (d. 297H)  </ul>    <P>
Stated that Allaah is above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, ascended over it, "baa'inun min khalqihi" (separate and distinct from His creation) so they clarified and explained and affirmed the true meaning in the texts, which is that <u>Allaah Himself</u> is above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>. So this is <u>tafseer of the ma'naa</u> found in the Book and the Sunnah and in invalidates what has been claimed by <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-Nawawi</font></a> (rahimahullaah) - and we can go on with more and more examples but this is just an indication.    <P>
And the refutation of the claim that the Salaf made tafweed or <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is a long one and it has its own place and the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah have falsified this claim and amongst the Ash'aris they have a conflict between themselves regarding whether tafweed is the way or <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> is the way (to protect their intellectual  proof) and sufficient is this difference between themselves as a proof for their opposition to the way of the Salaf.     <P>
And we will deal with a lot of these issues in separate articles inshaa'Allaah - but we have deliberately not started out with dealing with instances of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> claimed by the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> because in a way that is a decoy. The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> favor keeping the discussion centered around issues of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and instances of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> because it removes attention from the real foundation of their deen, the nature of the ilm ul-kalaam and what it all springs from historically, which is "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", the corrupt, false, intellectual proof devised originally by <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> (ex. 128H), then developed and refined by <a href='tags/abu-al-hudhayl-al-allaaf.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hudhayl al-Allaaf</font></a> the Mu'tazili (d. 235H) and then adopted by the Ash'aris after them - and it was on account of this that they distorted much of the creed.     <P>
