<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Hanafi Tamperings with al-Ibaanah of <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></font>     <P>
In previous articles (see <a href=indexbaa4.html?xoufz>Part 1</a>, <a href=index69b8.html?uqxke>Part 2</a>, <a href=indexb479.html?ohgey>Part3</a>, <a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf>Part 4</a> and <a href=index7298.html?czfxq>Part 5</a>) we established the irrelevant and immaterial examples cited by hypocritical and dishonest <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as evidence of tampering of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> by Ahl al-Sunnah. They claimed that the variation in the mention of eye (al-ayn) in singular and dual form between Ibn Asakir's (d. 571H) version and that of today's published versions is sign of tampering. We explained that <b>this is totally irrelevant</b> because other <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> such as <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> affirm two eyes, and al-Ashari mentions two eyes in al-Maqaalaat, and other <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari Scholars</font></a> affirm the genus of eye, such as <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, and it makes no difference, because even with this variation amongst these early scholars it is undeniably established that they - unlike the Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> - affirm these as attributes of the essence of Allaah, WITHOUT ta'wil and tafwid and they refuted the ta'wils of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. We also pointed out that they are in agreement with Ahl al-Sunnah on this matter except on a subsidiary detail, which is that Ahl al-Sunnah affirm for Allaah specifically and negate from Allaah in general, for example, "<i>We affirm hand for Allaah, without tashbih and takyif</i>." As for these <a href='tags/early-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Early Ash'aris</font></a> they affirmed these attributes specifically but also negated specifically, saying, "<i>We affirm hand for Allaah and it is not a limb or flesh or bones</i>" and so on. Even if the meaning is correct, this is a methodological departure from the revealed texts and the way of the Salaf. This is the only real difference. So the entirety of the Salaf, and these early Kullabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a> are united against the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> fraudsters who conceal themselves behind the slogan of "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" and who say <a href='tags/al-yad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-yad</font></a> is "qudrah" and "ni'mah" which is the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>We also established that the tables were turned on these Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in that there is 100% proof that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> has been tampered with by <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, and a few examples were given that establish that in <a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf >Part 4</a>, alongside the fact that Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> who published <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> using four manuscripts explicitly stated that the Alexandrian manuscript which varies froom the rest, has been tampered with and has "ibaaraat madsoosah" (fabricated insertions). The clearest example of that was how an Ashari bigot took a couple of paragraphs from one of al-Ghazali's books regarding <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a> and inserted it into al-Ibaanah (<a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf >see here</a>) in order to support the view of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this  matter.</div>    <P>
Coming to the topic, we have made much reference to the docility of these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the deficiency in their intellects, in what has preceded and often the refutation against them is in the very proof they attempt to use to establish their falsehood. Except that Allaah blinded them in both vision and insight, and despite something being plain and manifest and in front of their noses, their following their hawaa prevents them from seeing it.    <P>
Now, the issue of Abu Hanifah and the few statements found in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> regarding him will be dealt in more detail in the next part in this series, as we don't want to mix two issues in the same article.  In this article we simply want to point out Hanafi tamperings in two of the manuscripts.    <P>
Take a good look at this (the screenshot provided by the Jahmites) Dr. Fawqiyah's published version of al-Ibanah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana101.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
Take a look at the bit underlined which occurs after what is narrated from Hammad bin Abi Sulayman that "<i>Tell Abu Hanifah the Mushrik, I am free of him</i>" (we will deal with this topic in the next article), we see the following statement which is found only manuscripts (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1587;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1583;</span>) - (<a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf>see this article for information on the various manuscripts</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Far be it that <b>al-Imaam al-A'dham (the greatest imaam)</b> Abu Hanifah (radiyallaahu anhu) from this saying, rather it is a lie and falsehood, for verily Abu Hanifah is from the best of Ahl al-Sunnah.</blockquote>    <P>
What gives away that this is an insertion into <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>, most likely by a Hanafi is a) that this sentence is not found in the other manuscripts (six in all) except the two indicated and b)   this title, <b>al-Imaam al-A'dham</b> was never used by anyone in that time, considering that the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> disputants who affirm its authorship believe al-Ashari authored it after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> so we are talking just after 300H. Was the title al-Imaam al-A'dham  used then?! This term was a much later introduction, and it appears that a Hanafi who did not like what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> quoted, inserted this text in order to defend Abu Hanifah, and defence of Abu Hanifah on this particular issue is one thing and that is praiseworthy, <b>but tampering with a book is another thing</b> - because <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> is not unique in citing this report, he was preceded by at least 70 years by Imam al-Bukhari who also cited this report, and others who cited it are <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a>, al-Laalikaa'ee and al-Khatib al-Baghdaadi. And the mere citation of a report is not an indication that a book is fabricated!!    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So having said all of this, the fact that this is an insertion, is a totally separate matter from the issue of Abu Hanifah and the saying of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created and this particular narration from Hammad bin Abi Sulayman on this matter. We will address that in the next article inshaa'Allaah, and understand why Abu Hanifah was attributed with this saying, even though we know for sure that it is not the view of the Hanafis, and is contradicted by what is narrated from Abu Hanifah through his student Abu Yusuf.</div>    <P>
<b>Summary:</b> We learn from this that both Ash'aris and Hanafis have had their hand in playing with this book. In the case of the Ash'aris it is to support the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> they are upon in rejecting <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, al-Istwaa and the Sifat Khabariyyah in which they oppose <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, al-Ashari, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and others. But in the case of the Hanafis, whilst you could excuse them from the angle of wanting to exonerate Abu Hanifah from that which he is free of, it can be done in ways besides tampering with a book.   <P>
