<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Paper Background: Predication, Immutability, the Ten Categories</font>    <P>
We already covered this in the <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>Part 2</a>, but since it is crucial to understanding the matter, we are reproducing it here. The author discussed the issue of predication and immutability. <i><b>Predication</b></i> is simply to assign a quality, attribute or property to a thing. And <i><b>immutability</b></i> means the inability to change, to not undergo any type of change. Now <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> spoke a lot about the issue of predication, and this was a linguistic discussion, however, this was integrally tied to his syllogistic logic, by which the truthfulness of propositions is evaluated. A proposition is simply to say "A is B", such as "the tea is hot." You have probably heard of this before, its like this:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>All A's are B's<BR>  X is an A<BR>  Therefore X is a B</blockquote></div>    <P>
So since the truth and falsehood of propositions was integral to attaining knowledge to <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, the issue of predication in the language, as in assigning qualities and  properties to things, was discussed in detail by <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>. Likewise, he also laid down what are known as his Categories, which is known as <b>al-Jawhar wal-Arad</b> (substance and incidental attribute) or <b>al-Maqulat al-Ashar</b> (the ten categories). The intent of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> here was to <u>comprehensively categorize</u> everything that can take the place of a subject and a predicate in a proposition. In the proposition "<i>the tea is hot</i>", the "<i>tea</i>" is the subject and "<i>is hot</i>" is the predicate. So he came up with ten categories and everything in the universe is either a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (jawhar, jism) or nine incidental attributes, and incidental attributes are found only in substances. All of this <u>created the framework</u> upon which his logic and philosophy could be built. These ten categories are presented below:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The first category deals with "what something is":    <P>
<ol><li> <u><a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>)</ol>    <P>
The rest are incidental attributes (a'raad, also referred to as "accidents") which deal with "how it is":    <P>
<ol><li><u>quantity</u> (al-kam) - dimensions and measurable features, length, breadth, width and so on  <li><u>quality</u> (al-kayf) - perceived characteristics, color, shape, and so on.  <li><u>relation</u> (al-idaafah) - how a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is in relation to others, above, below, right, left and so on.  <li><u>place</u> (al-ayn) - where it is  <li><u>time</u> (mataa) answering "when?" - temporal characteristics of the substance  <li><u>position</u> (al-wad') - how a substance's parts are ordered in relation to each other  <li><u>action</u> (yaf'al) acting - what a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> is doing  <li><u>affection</u> (yanfa'il) a <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> being acted upon  <li><u>having</u> (al-mulk) - what the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> has on  </ol></div>    <P>
Once this is clear, what we need to understand is that these aspects of Aristotle's philosophy already affected those amongst the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews and Christians before it affected the Muslims. And so what we are going to do here is look at the theology of a Jew and a Christian before Islam came (we will look at the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in a separate article altogether). One is <b><a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a></b> (20BC-50CE) was a Jew from Alexandria who was present around the time <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> (alayhis salaam), and the second is <b><a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a></b> of Hippo (d. 430CE), a Christian. Now, you will see a stark resemblance between the language of their theology and the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, in fact its identical. the ilm al-kalaam, of the Ahl al-Kalaam is not so original. Rather, it's simply the second-hand, used and abused toy of the past nations (Sabeans, Jews, Christians). Unfortunately, when it came into the hands of the Mutakallimin (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), they took it and lapped it up like a kid does ice-cream, not realizing that there has been many a nation, or scholastic whose already "<i>been there, done that</i>." So pay attention, we will be discussing predication, immutability and negating Aristotle's ten categories from Allaah - which is essentially what the deen of the Mutakallimin is founded upon - as opposed to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, which is:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>To affirm for Allah what He and His Messenger affirmed for Him without <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> (which include tafwid), takyif, tamthil, tahrif (which includes ta'wil) and tashbih, and there is not any tashbih in anything that the revealed texts affirmed for Him by consensus of the Imaams of the Salaf.</b></div>    <P>
We can now continue with the paper, from where we left off in the previous article, it might be a good idea to <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta>review that article first</a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Pre-Islamic Era, Jewish and Christian "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" Mutakallims, Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria and Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo, Preceding the Theology of the Mutakallimin by Hundreds of Years</font>    <P>
So here, this is an interesting and exciting part of this series, so lets drive straight in, so  take a seat, relax, let it sink in:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/immutability-paper-g.gif border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Commentary</font>    <P>
We need to comment on this piecemeal:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px"><i>What <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> saw.</i></font> </blockquote>    <P>
After discussing the use of the theory of <b>predication</b> and Aristotle's <b>categories</b> and being manifested in the theology of both <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> with respect to the issue of <b>immutability</b> (not being subject to change), he is now summarizing and presenting the actual details of their theology, things that they agreed upon.    <P>
He makes an observation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">Philo and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> never abandoned Aristotle's theory of predication, even though they saw that the case of God's immutability tested the resources of that theory. They used the theory to describe a being who, ironically, does not fit the metaphysical assumptions on which the theory rests. Aristotle's theory applies most clearly to substances, the concrete individuals of our ordinary experience, of which biological specimens are the clearest examples. Such substances have essences (specified by genus and differentia), perhaps idia, and certainly accidents, the latter features being involved in accidental change and due, most typically, to the vagaries of the matter composing the <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a>.    <P>
God, however, is a metaphysically simple being, his simplicity being entailed by the notions that he is completely independent of and sovereign over all things. </font></blockquote>    <P>
What he is essentially saying is very close but not identical to what Ahl al-Sunnah say in that Allah's essence is unlike all other essences. Hence, to make those conceptual tools (meaning the use of Aristotelian Metaphysics) to be the framework and platform for discussing the One whose essence can never be understood, and is unlike these essences and their necessities, cannot really be a source of sure knowledge, rather it is speculation.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And we gave an example before, to illustrate the error of these Mutakallimin (the Jewish, Christian and Muslim ones), and so we said that what these Mutakallimin are really saying is that:    <P>
<blockquote>If something created is said to be "above", then it necessitates that it must be a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) that occcupies space, since being "above" can only be said of "bodies". They held that <u>the same necessities</u> apply to Allaah, such that if it is said about  Allaah that He is "above" [something Allah Himself says, and His Prophets and Messengers said, and the Righteous Salaf had consensus on], then <u>the same necessities (lawaazim) must also apply to Him</u>, and this would therefore mean He is a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>) and hence this must be rejected and all the texts pertaining to this matter, must be interpreted figuratively. However, what they have done here is to make a false analogy for Allaah, for they fell into <b>qiyas al-shumul</b> (analogy by inclusion) in that they included Allaah within all the bodies, such that whatever lawaazim (necessities) apply to created bodies, must also apply to Him if that same language is also used for Him. So they equated Him with all other bodies in terms of the rules, laws and necessities pertaining to the language of description. And this is baatil (false) for Allaah's essence is unlike all essences, and if Allaah says He is "above" and that He will "come, arrive" on the Day of Judgement then those lawaazim applying to created bodies do not apply to Him at all. </blockquote>    <P>
<b>So in essence, they made <u>tashbih</u> in the very <u>theoretical basis</u> of their speech, of their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. </b>    <P>
They are in reality the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, they made tashbih first, in the very theoretical basis of their speech, and then were forced to treat what Allaah described Himself with as tajsim and tashbih. And Allaah is exonerated and purified from what they say.</div>    <P>
And it is for this reason that the truth in the revealed Books and from the sent Messengers is to say "We believe in whatever Allaah and His Messenger affirmed for Him, without takyif and tashbih." And as for the saying of misguided god-forsaken wandering strayers, from the Greek and Sabean star and idol-worshipping pagan disbelievers and their conceptual tools and philosophies and <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, then the Believers are not in need of it!    <P>
He then says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">The following minimum core to the doctrine of God's simplicity can be found in both <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>.</font></blockquote>    <P>
Now you've got to close the door, avoid all distractions and sit down here:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Between the Ilm al-Kalaam of Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> the Jew, Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> the Christian - Founded Upon the Conceptual Tools of <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> - and the Ilm al-Kalaam of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Heretics Claiming Orthodoxy</font>    <P>
So here is that theism, broken down into four points:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">(A) God has no physical extension or spatial parts. If he did, he would not be simple, and he would be dependent on the parts for his being as he is.</font></blockquote>    <P>
This is identical to the theology of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah. It is to speak of Allaah through negations, by negating <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (embodiment) from Him. And that is what is in the above statement. It is identical to what you find in the books of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>. Its a denial that Allah is a <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a> body with spatial extension. For the Mutakallimin of Islaam, this language is based upon their definition of <a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a> (the indivisible particle, atomism) which they define as something with no spatial extension - until it combines with another indivisible atom, when it becomes a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), hence anything with extension and bulk is a body (in spatial occupation). The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were the ones who incorporated <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> into the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and to help you understand why:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> <b><u>The Indivisible Particle</u></b>    <P>
<blockquote>Recall that the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (origination of bodies) argues that the presence of attributes and incidental attributes or actions in or by bodies proves that they must be originated. But then because not all bodies have the same incidental attributes, as there are very many (color, taste, height, width, depth, texture, motion, rest, combination, separation and so on), the Mutakallimin tried to find such incidental attributes that would be common to all bodies. So they came up with what they called the four akwaan (states of being), sukun (rest), harakah (motion), combination (itjimaa'), iftiraaq (separation). Further, to make it easier to apply this proof to the entire universe, meaning all bodies, they introduced the idea of <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a>. Which is that the entire universe is made of <u>identical  particles</u>, and the only thing that makes each thing unique and separate is its incidental attributes. Thus, fire, water, wood, hair, jelly and your custard pie, is all made of identical atoms, the different qualities present in those atoms is what makes each thing what it is.  With the introduction of this theory by the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, they really streamlined the proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and made it easier to argue the case for the universe being originated, because if incidental attributes are found in bodies at the atomic level, and all bodies are the same (<i>tamaathul al-ajsaam</i>) then the entire universe (upon their demonstration of huduth al-ajsam) can be said to be originated with a single stroke, and no need to start wrangling around with all those different types of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) which cannot be said of all bodies. It's like simplifying equations, why have long complex equations when you can simplify them a great deal and  make them much neater and more presentable. Same thing here.</blockquote>    <P>
<b><u>The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> are the Effeminates of the Mu'tazilah</u></b>    <P>
<blockquote>The <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> took this proof wholesale from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and they opposed <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in this, because <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> in the latter part of his life and in his later books declared it an innovation. But those after him opposed his way, and incorporated it into their theology. So this is why you see the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> using this same language of bodies and their incidental attributes (al-ajsaam, al-a'raad) and speaking of things with bulk, dimension and so on. Because they made this  proof to be the foundation of their religion, they were forced to speak about Allaah, with its language.</blockquote> </div>    <P>
<u>Coming back to the quotation above</u>:     <P>
<blockquote>What <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> are really saying is found in the last part of that sentence, "<i>he would be dependent on the parts for his being as he is</i>" and this means that God is free of all those attributes which require <a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a> (embodiment, being a body) to exist. Again keep in mind, Aristotle's categories, and keep in mind how <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to the Mutakallimin became one in which the nine categories (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>) besides <a href='tags/substance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>substance</font></a> (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) had to be negated from Allaah in order to maintain what they presumed to be <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, which in reality is the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, not the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers. They [Philosophers and the Mutakallimin and the Mutakallimin amongst themselves] just <u>disputed</u> with each other about <u>subsidiary issues</u> about the names, attributes and actions, whilst being united that the truth does in fact lie in this language, not in the language of the revealed texts which contain nothing but tajsim and tashbih for the benefit of the <a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>dumb commoners</a> who would not accept faith unless they were spoken to in this language. So in reality, the hearts of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah resemble and share with the hearts of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, and it is little wonder that after centuries of wrangling around, the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> decided to hybridize kalam with falsfah and found no problem in incorporating aspects of it into their books. In fact, <a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a> (in Sharh al-Maqaasid), justifies it by saying that the objective behind both kalam and <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> is to arrive  at the truth and so there is no harm in using a bit of this and a bit of that.</blockquote>    <P>
So this first statement is <u>the foundation of the rejection of the attributes</u> by the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> affirmed some attributes for the essence, and so the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> declared them <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> because this would necessitate Allaah is a body (in order to have attributess) from one angle, and also from another, it necessitates Allaah is composed, since multiplicity of meanings in the essence (i.e. having attributes) meanings multiplicity of essences.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And we should point out again, that the reason for the likes of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> speaking with this type of language <u>is not the same</u> as the reason for the Mutakallimin in Islam. The Ahl al-Kalam in Islam did not just go out and say "Hey, let's use Aristotle's conceptual tools", when <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> is actually an enemy to them. But <u>when they adopted this proof of huduth al-ajsaam</u> which came into the Ummah from the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of <a href='tags/harran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Harran</font></a>, through al-Ja'd bin Dirham, and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, and then to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah, and they saw that there was no other way to prove the universe is originated and has an Originator, they were <b>FORCED</b> to speak by its necessities, and thus, we see their language being no different to that of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a>, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> and the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and others in their theism, and all of them used the conceptual tools of the <a href='tags/greek-philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Greek <a href="tags/philosophers.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Philosophers</font></a></font></a>, even if the routes through which they fell into this were entirely different.</div>    <P>
<b><u>The Proof of Tarkib (Composition)</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>Also in this statement above from the author, is an indication of the proof of tarkib (composition) of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, that of negating parts, and the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, when they saw that the proof of huduth al-ajsaam was corrupt, they adopted this proof. It was <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> who originated this proof as part of his proof of imkan and wujub (possible and necessary existence). This is the reasoning of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to deny the attributes (multiple meanings in the essence means separate entities or components, and this means composition). Just as it was used by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> to reject Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, His being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>. So you see they all take from the same foundation and try to combat Ahl al-Sunnah with it, in their own way, and its origin is not from the revealed Books or sent Messengers, rather it is origin is the aql of a pagan disbeliever, worshipper of stars and idols, one who corrupted many a nation and its theology, hundreds of years before these tail ends of the likes of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> appeared in this ummah. We speak of the resemblance between them here purely in terms of their sharing with each other in these conceptual tools, we can consider them the tail-ends of those from previous religions who also had their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and disputed about their Lord, albeit in the presence of a corrupted scripture - unlike the Mutakallimin who dispute about their Lord whilst the scripture is present, pure and unalderated.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So if you go and look in all the books of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> (we made a list of all the major ones in <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta >Part 2</a>), you will see this language. They spoke of bodies, their incidental attributes, and then were forced to use this same language in negating for Allaah, and they wrongly thought this was the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> with which they had been commanded. </div>    <P>
Then the author said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">(B) God has no temporal parts. There are no stages to his career, no past, no future. Instead, he is eternal, enjoying the fullness of his life all at once.</font></blockquote>    <P>
Here in (B), and also in (C) we are moving into what are called hawaadith (events), the issue of events in time. The first part of their theology above in (A) relates to negation of incidental attributes requiring a body for their existence, so the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> treated everything (whether it is an attribute, like hearing, seeing) or an action (istiwaa, pleasure, anger) as being an <a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a> (incidental attribute). They never distinguished between <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events). It was the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> who following <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, denied Allaah's chosen actions which they considered hawaadith (events, occurrences). So what we are seeing in (B) is the negation of hawaadith which is the crux of the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi schools of heresy.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>What <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> (a Jew) and <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> (a Christian) agree upon is what al-Ja'd bin Dirham brought into the Ummah after his brain was fried and roasted by the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of Harraan. He said, Allaah never spoke to Moses direct, and nor did He take Ibrahim as His friend.     <P>
<blockquote><b>And the saying of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created, it was taken by al-Ja'd bin Dirham from the Jews, their Rabbis, who said the Torah is created, and they also held this view upon the same conceptual tools of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad, and we can see it in the theology of <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a>, the negation of hawaadith (events, occurrences). So this was the saying of the Jews, their Rabbis and it is all founded upon the conceptual tools of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, so just as this pagan disbeliever worshipper of the stars corrupted the deen of nations gone by, then likewise he corrupted the deen of the Mutakallimin, except that they simply did not realize it.</b></blockquote>    <P>
So to them, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> cannot be Allaah's speech because it is many different meanings, letters and words, it would mean events in Allaah's essence, necessitating He is a body like the bodies. Hence, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> said Allaah does not have speech, it is something He creates, and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> said Allaah does have speech, but it is something created and can be said to His, just like we say "Allaah's Messenger", "Allaah's house", "Allaah's she-camel", so it is Allah's speech but metaphorically speaking. And the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> said Allaah has <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (an eternal meaning in the self, immutable, singular) but Allaah is not able to speak as and when He wills. They did this in order to find a middle path between the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ahl al-Sunnah, trying to affirm the attribute (with the innovation of kalam nafsee) but denying hawaadith (events) for Allaah. So they agreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality, and pretended to agree with Ahl al-Sunnah through plays with words.</div>    <P>
So the meaning of this part (B) [and also (C) further below] is that Allaah cannot have <u>successive actions</u> in that He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> <u>after</u> creating the heavens and earth, and that He created <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> <u>before</u> He created the Preserved Tablet, and that He created the heavens and earth fifty-thousand years <u>after</u> writing down all the decrees, and that He ordered the Angels to prostrate <u>after</u> creating Adam, and that He will arrive and come on the Day of Judgement and that His speech to Moses is other than His speech to Muhammad which are other than His speech on the Day of Judgement to the Believers, or to the inhabitants of Hellfire and so on. This is what is meant, and this is one of the usool of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. As we can see it preceded them by 800-900 years (in Shaykh Philo) and 400-500 years (in Shaykh Augustine).    <P>
Now as for the reason they did this, in order to prevent Allaah from being subject to <u>time</u> and <u>events</u> as they claim in order to deny embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>) from Him, then this is all ambiguous speech, and it is a topic that bewilders the mind, and they delved it into and this is why some of them got their brains <u>fried and roasted</u> and at the end of their lives lamented over it, and they could not work out which proof was stronger, the universe being originated or being eternal.     <P>
Then the author said in outlining the next component of their theology:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">(C) God has no accidental attributes. Feature (A) excludes from God all accidental attributes whose exemplification requires embodiment. (C) says something stronger than (A) if there are accidents whose exemplification does not require embodiment. It would be natural to think that, say, knowing that Adam sinned is just such an <a href='tags/accident.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>accident</font></a>, exemplified by a purely spiritual God. I shall not defend the view here, but I believe that a defender of God's simplicity can argue cogently that although Adam's having sinned is contingent and God knows it, those facts do not confer an accidental property on God. </font></blockquote>    <P>
This again is on the subject of hawaadith (events, occurrences), and whatever was said regarding (B) applies here, since both features (B) and (C) are actually regarding the same topic, and it is what the Mutakallimin refer to as hawaadith (events, occurrences), and by this they reject that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, such as <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, love, pleasure, anger and the likes.    <P>
We also see here the author alluding to a distinction between incidental attributes requiring embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>) and incidental attributes not requiring embodiment. And this kind of represents the point of contention between the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> in that how can you affirm attributes which you claim do not necessitate embodiment, like knowledge, hearing, seeing, wish, power, speech, and yet deny others upon the argument they necessitate embodiment (<a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a>). The same is said by all factions who were consistent in their positions, be that the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who denied all attributes and actions consistently, or be that Ahl al-Sunnah who affirmed all attributes and actions without takyif and tahrif consistently. The author gave an example pertaining to Allah's knowledge to illustrate how someone (who holds onto this theologyof <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and Augustine) <u>might justify</u> separating between (A) and (C) without this quality (of knowledge) being considered an accidental property. In any case, Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> and Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> are clearly denying - upon the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad - that Allaah has incidental attributes requiring embodiment and incidental attributes as a whole.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is the foundation of the Mutakallimin rejecting what Allaah affirmed for Himself in the revealed texts of actions tied to His will and power, and for this the Salaf waged war against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and this battle culminated in the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created - which was fought over this very principle, since the true underlying issue was that of Allaah's chosen actions - which they denied, as had Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> (leading to the saying that the Torah is created), and likewise Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>. So this battle raged until <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> subdued those Heretics.</div>    <P>
<blockquote>But then along came <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, entered into this matter, tried to debate the equivalents of those Philoites and Augustinites in this ummah (i.e. the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah), and he was unable to answer them on the issue of Allaah's speech, and their doubt that this necessitates events in Allaah's essence according to them. So he refuted them on everything else, Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and <a href='tags/sifat-khabariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifat khabariyyah</font></a> (face, hands, eyes) but could not refute them on this  matter. So <u>he innovated the doctrine of kalam nafsee</u> having been forced to reject Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, and then he had to <u>apply this principle consistently and uniformly</u>, so therefore he had to reject other attributes like <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/istiwaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">istiwaa</font></a></font></a>, love, pleasure, anger as being tied to Allaah's will, and he took a certain approach in dealing with these attributes, as did the <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> who followed his doctrine after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. So they said Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> is not an action of Allaah, but an action that takes place in <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, and they said pleasure and anger are synonymous with Allaah's wish (iraadah) or that they are eternal attributes just like life, knowledge, power and the likes. So they took the very approaches towards Allaah's chosen actions that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took towards Allaah's attributes, which is saying Allaah's attributes are synonymous with His essence or separate from His essence. </blockquote>    <P>
Then the author mentions the fourth feature:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">(D) God has an essence, but his essence is not a combination of genus and differentia. If it were, then he would be metaphysically complex and dependent on the genus and differentia for his being what he is.</font></blockquote>    <P>
This language is also from <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, that of genus (a family of things) and differentia (specific elements in that family which have unique definitions). Again, this type of innovated negation not brought by the Prophets and Messengers is a foundation for the Mutakallimin for denying for Allaah what He affirmed for Himself.     <P>
<blockquote><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px">In essence, we can say Shaykh <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> of Alexandria was a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Mu'tazilite, as was Shaykh <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a> of Hippo, also a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, Mu'tazilite. And we see here the amazing resemblance between this and the ilm al-kalaam of the Ahl al-Kalaam. This is what the Salaf condemned, this particular ilm al-kalaam of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad (not the genus of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which can involved defending the truth by the Book and the Sunnah and <u>sound uncorrupted</u> reason). The ilm al-kalaam of the Mutakallimin is founded upon the corrupted reason of a pagan, disbeliever, worshipper of stars and idols, a wandering strayer who corrupted what the Greeks were upon, let alone the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Jews, Christians and Muslims. And the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are the followers of this ilm al-kalaam, as we have proven in <a href=indexb520.html?wtxta >Part 2</a>, in that we see the language of al-ajsaam and al-a'raad as part of the proof of huduth al-ajsaam found <b>in all of their books</b> and it is the very foundation of their theology. The later ones realized its corruption and started including other proofs in their works as well, that of tarkib (composition) and takhsis (specification) which ironically are taken from the very <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> they were trying to refute!    <P>
So the hujjah is established and it is not possible for any <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> to remain upon his falsehood, and following scholars who came and went, who were clearly in error in what they entered into, is no longer an excuse - it is not permissible to use the likes of <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, al-Qurtub, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, Ibn Hajar and their likes, because we have already explained how and why they fell into what they fell into. So when that matter becomes clear, there is no longer that excuse of using the speech of those scholars, so all that is required now is for you to announce your repentance, abandon that false theology and all its associated language and to speak with nothing but the pure Book and the Sunnah in both affirmation and negation.</font></blockquote>    <P>
