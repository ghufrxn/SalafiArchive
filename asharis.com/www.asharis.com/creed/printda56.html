<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In a previous article (<a href=index556a.html?nsiuy >see here</a>, at the end), we explained an unfortunate situation that developed in the 20th century when a new species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> came on the scene to pollute the atmosphere. This was represented in the Hanafi-Maturidi called Muhammad Zahid <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a>, a shrewd and cunning academic shyster, and extremely bigoted Hanafi, who brought a new type of enmity against Ahl al-Sunnah and whose lies, deceptions and distortions, and attacks upon the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact the Imaams of the Salaf, was documented by the likes of the Shaykh, Abdu al-Rahmaan al-Mu'allami al-Yamaanee in his book <i>al-Tankeel Bimaa Fee Ta'neeb <a href='tags/al-kawtharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Kawtharee</font></a> Min al-Abaateel</i>.      <P>
<blockquote>This species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> coupled intense hatred along with academic dishonesty and unfortunately is the one dominant today on the blogs, forums, websites and discussions and the likes. What this species has produced is an unnecessary cluttering and pollution of the environment, a type of mist and fog, that brings unncessary confusion in addition to the confusion that already exists. Being ignorant (or pretending to be ignorant) of the true and real positions of the Salaf as well as having a crooked intent (excluding the sincere clueless who are just caught up in this whirlwind),  they spread lies and misquote the Imaams of the Salaf, and misrepresent the actual issues - far away from any meaningful, beneficial, true academic type of discussion. These mischief-makers (who are a very devious and crooked type of pseudo-Ash'ari and Maturidi) sit in the middle and their aim is to lie, swindle, deceive, distort, fabricate, confuse, distort to hearts content so that there remains a great cloud of confusion created in the middle where no one knows what on earth is going on, and and no one knows who really says what and who really believes what, and the aim behind all of it is to prevent people from coming to know the true and real Salafi aqidah. So when you have Muslims who are sincere and they want to follow the truth, it becomes extremely difficult for them to find out the real aqidah of the Salaf, because of all the confusion, diversion and misrepresentation they have to wade through. A lot of them just give up, fatigued. </blockquote>    <P>
Once you acknowledge this (and you will have to by the time you have read this article in full inshaa'Allaah), you will see what difference there is between those from the generality of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> (in this case a Hanafi-Maturidi [<i><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></i> is an umbrella term for both groups]) who display insaaf (justice) and sidq (honesty) in how they characterize the view of their opponents and between the straying, wandering, lying, deceiving, treacherous pied-pipers (who lead) and their clueless zombies (who follow) that you find trolling the web and creating fitnah for the Ummah.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><a href="tags/muhammad-anwar-shah-al-kashmiri.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhammad Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri</font></a></font>    <P>
He is a Hanafi-Maturidi-Deobandi scholar (d. 1352H) and he has explanations of the books of hadeeth such as the Saheeh of al-Bukhari and the Sunan of al-Tirmidhi and dictations and marginal notes on Muslim, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/kashmiri-arf-shadhi-cover.gif border=1 hspace=2 border=0>    <img src=assets/images/kashmiri-bukhari-cover.gif border=1 hspace=2 border=0>     <P>
To the above are the covers for the books <i>al-Arf al-Shadhiyy Sharh Sunan al-Tirmidhi</i> (tahqiq, Muhammad Shakir, Dar Ihyaa al-Turath al-Arabi, 2004), and <i>Faid al-Bari alaa Sahih al-Bukhari</i> (Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2005). We are going to quote his commentary on the hadeeth pertaining to the Nuzul (descent) of Allaah, the Exalted, as it contains a valuable explanation about the issue of <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>, hadath, <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>, makhluq, and the confusion in these terms as it relates to the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (Allaah's chosen actions). And likewise his commentary on certain chapters in al-Bukhari's <i>Kitab al-Tawhid</i> relating to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Allaah's speech.    <P>
As for his belief, then he is a Maturidi, and naturally, we consider him in opposition to the Salaf in his doctrinal views, and thus whatever refutations are found with the Salaf and their followers, past and present, against the schools of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and the likes would be applicable. However, what we find here (in the quote that we are going to present and comment on) is a display of honesty and justice that you will not find these days (for the reasons mentioned above in the introduction).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> It would be a good idea to do some background reading on this subject which we have already covered in previous articles. In particular refer to    <a href=index7f59.html?nubev>this article</a>, <a href=index7917.html?bvhjb>this one</a> and <a href=index5bb7.html?ramab>this one</a>. That will give you a good primer.</div> <P>




<p><font class='titleHeadline'>An Important Observation Regarding Language and Terminology</font>    <P>
It is vital to understand that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> schools of theology (Ash'aris and Maturidis) have a particular language (not known to the Salaf) and they make use of terms and phrases to describe and characterize certain views. In this particular case, they use the word "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) to refer to the actions of Allaah tied to His will and power. Thus, when you come to read the speech of al-Kashmiri, you should be aware of the type of language he is using to characterize the view of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (which is the view of the Salaf), and you have to see beyond and above the terminology he is using and simply grasp the actual meanings and concepts that he is explaining and putting across. We do not agree with this terminology, and it is not from the way of the Salaf to speak of Allaah's actions (af'aal) in this manner.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Kashmiri on Imaam al-Bukhari Affirming "Hadath" For Allaah Without That Meaning "Makhluq"</font>    <P>
We are at the end of volume 6 in <i>Kitab al-Tawhid</i> in al-Bukhari's Sahih and the chapter is "<b>Chapter: The Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of the Lord With Jibreel and Allaah's Calling (Nidaa') to the Angels</b>." And al-Bukhari brings the verses (27:6) that the Messenger receives the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> from Allaah and (2:37) that Aadam received words from His Lord (through which to repent), and likewise three ahaadeeth. <u>The hadeeth</u> that when Allaah loves a person He calls out to Jibreel with nidaa', and then Jibreel in turn announces it in the heaven. <u>The hadeeth</u> of the Angels taking turns to ascend to  Allaah at Fajr and Asr, and Allaah speaking to them and asking about His servants (even though He knows best about them). And <u>the hadeeth</u> that Jibreel came to the Prophet (alayhis salaam) and informed him that whoever died without committing Shirk will enter Paradise (even if he fell into major sins like stealing and fornication).    <P>
Here (p. 587) comments:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/kashmiri-bukhari-6-587.gif border=0>    <P>
<b>Translation:</b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">He began addressing the attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (speech), and his chapter headings regarding it have two angles. Firstly, to affirm the eternality of Allaah's speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>), and second to affirm the recency (huduth) of His action (fi'l) that takes place regarding it (the speech). Know that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is either <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> or [kalaam] lafdhee. The first was affirmed by <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and al-Hafidh <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> rejected it. I say: As for the rejection of al-Hafidh <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, then it is just protraction (i.e. long windedness), for it is established without doubt. And its detail is that  <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> has three levels:</font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote><b>First</b>, he affirms that al-Bukhari holds the attribute of speech to be <i>qadeem al-naw' <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> al-aahaad</i>, which means that in its type or genus it is eternal, as in Allaah has eternally been one who possesses the attribute of speech, as in one who speaks, and at the same time, the individual instances of speech are recent (in that they are tied to Allaah's will and power, giving the element of choice). And this is the position of the Imaams of the Salaf and it is plain and manifest in the Book and the Sunnah, and the Salaf affirmed Allaah's <i><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i> in opposition to the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Innovators.    <P>
<b>Second</b>, we see that al-Kashmiri, being a Maturidi starts arguing for the existence of kalam nafsee. He states that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> affirmed it but <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> rejected it. Then he goes on (p. 589) to give an explanation about how <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> has three stages, <u>a)</u> the mere presence of something memorized in the mind, such as the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, (without it being brought to the mind)  <u>b)</u> the bringing to mind of speech, such as when you recite the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> internally, in your self, and <u>c)</u> the actual words being expressed upon the tongue. In response to al-Kashmiri we say that the issue here is not whether <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> exists, rather the issue is what is the definition of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs. They do not refer to anything as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> unless it is external speech affording a meaning, so they say <i>lafdh mufeed</i>, or <i>nutq mufhim</i>, both meaning an actual expression that affords a meaning. So Ibn Taymiyyah's point is that, say for example, when someone  speaks in his mind and says "so and so is a fornicator" (as a false accusation against someone) is that counted as "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" and does the hadd (prescribed punishment) now become applicable to him? The answer is no, because this is not known as <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> to the Arabs, <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> must be external expression, and kalam is a combination of wording and meaning, but without the external wording, <u>it is not said to be <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> at all</u>. The issue of whether "meaning" exists in the soul is not under dispute, it is an issue of what is actually labelled as "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" in the language.     <P>
The Ash'aris and Maturidi positions on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> require for it to be said that the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> is "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" (when it is not), and upon that they are able to affirm the attribute of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> whilst adhering to the Jahmee principle of "<i>Whatever is not devoid of hawaadith is itself <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (originated)</i>" and on account of which they remove the element of choice (iraadah, ikhtiyaar) from Allaah's attribute of speech. <u>In reality, they have not affirmed any <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> for Allaah at all</u>. What they have affirmed is nothing but what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> call ilm and iraadah (knowledge and wish) and so the dispute between them and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is but one of wording only. Refer to the articles from their main scholars like <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> and al-Buti admitting this (see   <a href=indexa971.html?eujbe>here</a>, <a href=index2714.html?kiagk>here</a> and <a href=index4fa5.html?hirxg>here</a>), and also of interest is <a href=index2cfa.html?zjxdz>this article</a> on how the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> slapped the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> into oblivion on the issue of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a>, <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> and Makhluq</font>    <P>
Now after the above text al-Kashmiri goes on to explain the three levels of speech as indicated, and we have explained them above, and we are going to continue here by taking the rest of his comments on al-Bukhari's chapter by starting from the third level he mentions, the level of expression on the tongue:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/kashmiri-bukhari-6-589-590.gif border=0>    <P>
What we will do is translate this piecemeal and provide relevant commentary as we go along.    <P>
He says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">And the third: [The term "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" being] an expression of those words passing on the tongue, so <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, so long as it revolves in the soul is inconsiderable, and when it descends to the imagination it becomes an expression of imagined words, and then when it descends upon the tongue it becomes uttered words. So the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> is established through reason. Yes, the words of the author (al-Bukhari) are but concerning the [kalam] lafdhee (uttered word), and alongside that, these hawaadith (i.e. instances of uttered speech) established [with Allaah] are not created.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>If we put al-Kashmiri's argument or explanation for the existence of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" to one side, we see him acknowledging that al-Bukhari is not speaking except about the <b>kalaam lafdhee</b>. And al-Kashmiri refers to them as <i>al-hawaadith al-qaa'imah</i>, and we do not accept this language, because this is the characterization of the view of an Imaam of the Salaf through the language of the people of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. Rather, we say that this is Allaah speaking according to His will and power and as for "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>", and "kalaam lafdhee" and "hawaadith" and so on that is innovated language used to serve the theology of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>. In any case, the issue here is that he has correctly characterized the matter in meaning if we just ignore the terminology being used.</blockquote>    <P>
He then says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">And al-Haafidh [Ibn Hajar] considered this remote, so he said, "In affirming their recency (of the words), and negating that they are created is a contradiction, because there is no difference between the <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> and the makhluq.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This is what al-Kashmiri alluded to in his commentary on the hadeeth of al-Nuzul in <a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>Part 1</a>, where he stated that the explainers of the Sahih have tried to interpolate (make ta'weel) of some of al-Bukhari's speech and opinion. So here is stating that Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani considered it far-fetched that something can be <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> yet not makhluq.    <P>
Refer to our comments in <a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>Part 1</a> regarding the likes of Ibn Hajar who tried to merge what they accepted as the valid conclusions from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, without themselves having delved into <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> fundamentally, and with their knowledge of hadeeth and its sciences which was their main preoccupation. So often, the the likes of Ibn Hajar will give a slant or explanation of what al-Bukhari said though it might not actually be al-Bukhari's intent, so one has to be aware of that. And what indicates that the likes of Ibn Hajar are not to be relied upon entirely in their characterization of what the Imaams of the Salaf were upon his that Ibn Hajar claims that al-Bukhari took "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" from <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. Now this statement of Ibn Hajar is relied upon by todays <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as Ash'aris who try to defend <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, after it is revealed that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> did not formulate any new creed after leaving the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> but he just adopted the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. So in trying to deceive the audience, they bring praises for <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, whilst they know inside their own souls, that they reject the much of the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (and of al-Ash'ari), because the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> that came receded away from the views of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and brought their own influences into the school, until they just drifted in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>. So they do not have any real attachment to <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, except as a strategical, tactical move. When it is revealed that <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> is <u>the true author or precursor</u> of essentially both the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi creeds, they need to make some <u>public relations management</u> to keep this area covered. Hence, praises for <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>. It's all basically deception upon deception. But coming to the statement of Ibn Hajar that al-Bukhari "took <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> from Ibn Kullaab", then we see in al-Bukhari's Kitab al-Tawhid a rebuttal of the core principle of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a>, that of negating the element of choice (ikhtiyaar, iraadah) in Allaah's actions, and al-Bukhari mentioned numerous chapter headings within which are many ahaadeeth all of which establish that Allaah speaks as and when He wills. This is a refutation of the "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" doctrine and the attempts of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> to reject that Allaah has <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and fi'l tied to will and power (meaning, choice). We see that al-Bukhari has the following chapter headings:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>Chapter:</b> On the Mashee'ah and Iraadah  <li> <b>Chapter:</b> The Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of the Lord with Jibreel and Allaah's Calling (Nidaa') to the Angels  <li> <b>Chapter:</b> The Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, on the Day of Judgement with the Prophets and Other Than Them  <li> <b>Chapter:</b> His Saying, the Exalted, "<b>And Allaah spoke to Moses Direct</b>"  <li> <b>Chapter:</b> The Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) of the Lord with the Inhabitants of Paradise  </ul></div>    <P>
So it is clear that al-Bukhari invalidates the core foundational principle of the Kullaabi (and <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi) school(s) which is to deny Allaah has speech and action tied to His will and power. The point here then is that the likes of Ibn Hajar are not to be taken as primary sources for aqidah. But what we see practically, is that they are a convenient tool for the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of today, being used as part of a deceptive strategy in trying to give legitimacy to the theological views of the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> schools. This is why the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of today rely heavily upon citations from the likes of Ibn Hajar as the primary step in order to create obfuscation, confusion and the likes. You would do well to read our article on the various levels and types of Ash'aris or those to whom it is ascribed (<a href=index2046.html?cmwje>read it here</a>) where we highlight this practice of today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in some detail.    <P>
Al-Kashmiri proceeds to address this claim of Ibn Hajar in which he took and supported the view of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>.  </blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">I say: This has occurred due his absence of acquaintance with the terminological usages of the very early scholars, for that which is makhluq (created) to them is  the <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a> munfasil (the originated thing separate from Allaah's essence). As for when it [an action] is established with its doer, then it is not said about it that it is created. And this is the very essence of the (Arabic) language. For you say "Zayd stood" and "Amr sat," and you do not say "Zayd created standing (al-qiyaam)" and "Amr created sitting (al-qu'ood)." And this is because standing and sitting, even though they are both recent (events), except that they are not separated from Zayd and Amr. Hence, when a thing is established (as in takes place) with its doer, then it is <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (of recent occurrence) and not makhluq (created).</font></blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote>This is clear and it is the same that he explained in <a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>Part 1</a> of this series. The language distinguishes between an act established with an entity (which we refer to as haadith) and a thing arising from the result of the act of an entity, being separate from that entity (and hence is referred to as <a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>, makhluq). </blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">And it is surprising from al-Haafidh in that this prominent usage (by the earliest scholars) was hidden from him, for between the two words is a large difference. Do you not see that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has applied [the term] al-muhdath to itself, for He, the Exalted said, "<b>Comes not to them a remembrance from their Lord of revelation that is recent (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>)</b>..." (21:2). As for  the makhluq then it is narrated from <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and his two companions [Abu Yusuf and Muhammad bin Hasan] that the one  who spoke with the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has disbelieved. This is how <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> narrated it in the book al-Asmaa wal-Sifaat. So al-muhdath is related regarding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and applying the [term] al-makhluq leads to kufr. And when you grasp the difference between them both, then it will become easier upon you to apply the [term] al-haadith to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, alongside negating that it is makhluq,  and [thus], no contradiction between them remains.</font></blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote>In this paragraph is a nice explanation of what we have previously mentioned in many articles in trying to get into <u>the thick skull</u> of many a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> that since Allaah is the creator, then all His names, attributes and actions are uncreated. Thus, even if Allaah speaks (in the Arabic [the Qur'an], Hebrew [the Torah] or Syrian Aramaic [the Injeel] languages), then whatever arises from Allaah of speech (or action) which is tied to His will and power, then that is never said to be created (or "hawaadith" in  the language of the Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologists). However, these unsophisticated <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> cannot understand that if Allaah speaks, then what He speaks with is not created, no matter what language it is in (since Allaah is the knower of all things and He knows what His servants speak with, and He is one who speaks, and He is able to speak with whatever He wishes) and if we speak in whatever language, then our speech is created, because all of our attributes and actions take the ruling of <u>our essences</u>, which came to be after non-existence. As for Allaah, His essence has never ceased to be, and He has always been one who does whatever He wills and speaks whatever He wills. Thus nothing of His speech and action is created, even if it can be said to be <a href='tags/haadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haadith</font></a> (of recent occurrence). So here al-Kashmiri is corroborating this exact same meaning.    <P>
Then al-Kashmiri explains the intent of al-Bukhari in saying "<i>My utterance of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>." Al-Bukhari was in fact addressing the flip-side of the matter that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was addressing, and they were both upon the same belief. Al-Bukhari intended to establish that the actions of the servants are all created, which includes their actions of uttering, pronouncing the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. This is so that the people do not believe that the actions of the servants are uncreated. And <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> intended to establish that what is conveyed through the actions of the servants of the actual words, then those words originated with Allaah, and are uncreated and no matter how they are conveyed, the words, as in what is pronounced, not the act of pronunciation, what is recited, not the act of recitation, what is written, not the act of writing (or the ink or  paper), what is memorized, not the act of memorization, then it is the uncreated speech of Allaah, the Exalted, or originated with Him (as in He spoke it) and to Him shall it return. </blockquote>    <P>

So one must not think that he is speaking here of a specific faction of "orthodox" Muhaddithoon. Indeed, we see that even Hanbali Muhaddithoon like al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> (d. 453H) were affected by <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> due to taking knowledge from <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and they spoke with Kullaabi principles as it relates to Allaah's <a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a>, and al-Qaadee <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> left that later in life, even though the influence remained with him. <b>As for the Muhaddithoon from the Righteous Salaf in the first three centuries</b>, those whose aqidah and whose way is <i>a'lam</i> (most erudite), <i>ahkam</i> (most precise), and <i>aslam</i> (most safe), then all of them affirmed Allaah's chosen actions (<i><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></i>) which to the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> are referred to as "qiyaam <a href='tags/al-hawaadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hawaadith</font></a> billaah", meaning events, occurrences being established in Allaah's essence.

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This is false and rejected speech, rather the madhhab of the Salaf is nothing but the plain manifest truth, it is <i>a'lam</i> (most erudite), <i>ahkam</i> (most precise), and <i>aslam</i> (most safe), and none of the  Salaf knew the terminology of Ahl al-Bid'ah such as "qiyaam al-hawaadith" and "hulul al-hawaadith" and the likes. That only arose when the likes of al-Ja'd and al-Jahm brough the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> into the Ummah and then it became the language of theology for the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidah, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah. And the Salaf came into contact with different civiliations, creeds and orientations, indeed the Companions and Taabi'een conquered many lands and came across Jews, Christians, <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, Magians, Mandeans and others and none of this type of language in theology arose from them, rather it came from those who had little connection to the Companions and Taabi'een. And when this language started spreading, then the Imaams in the second century such as <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Abu Yusuf, Imaam Maalik and al-Shaafi'ee rejected it severely. So the saying of al-Kashmiri is mardood (rejected) and thrown against the wall becuase it is false speech that does not accord with the reality. However, al-Kashmiri is commended in that he did justice in explaining the view of the Salaf and he is miles apart from the likes of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari and the swindlers and shysters of his ilk. From this we come to known the reality of al-Kashmiri in that he acknowledges the actual way of the Salaf, except that he thinks the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> were greater in knowledge, erudition and understanding than Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, the Muhajireen, the Ansar, the Companions as a whole, the Taabi'een, <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, Malik, al-Shaafi'ee, al-Bukhari, Ahmad and the generality of the Salaf, and indeed this is <u>the reality</u> of the saying of any person who says that the Mutakallimeen are upon a way that is aslam (safer) and ahkam (more precise).</blockquote>    <P>
Finally, al-Kashmiri says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font style="font-size:19px;line-height:26px;">That which can be summarized from the madhhab of the author (al-Bukhari) is that the essence (dhaat) and his seven attributes and takween, all of them are qadeem (eternal). There remain the subsidiary af'aal (actions), such as al-nuzul (descent) al-dahak (laughter) and their likes. These (to al-Bukhari) are established with [the essence] of the Creator, the Exalted, and are of recent occurrence with Him. And to the Maturidiyyah they are separate (munfasilah) from Him.</font></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>And there are a number of points here:    <P>
<b>First</b>, al-Kashmiri tries to present al-Bukhari with a Maturidi perspective here, in speaking of "the essence, seven attributes and takwin" and stating al-Bukhari affirms this. Yes, but that is not all al-Bukhari affirms. When one reads al-Bukhari's Kitab al-Tawhid, we can see that al-Bukhari affirms  the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah which are denied by the Maturidis, and he affirms <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> for Allaah. Further, al-Bukhari affirms that Allaah's speech and action is tied to His will and power.     <P>
<b>Second</b>, al-Kashmiri acknowledges that al-Bukhari affirms the attributes tied to Allaah's will and power such as al-nuzul, al-dahak and that they are haadithah (of recent occurrence) [as in not eternal permanent attributes], yet not created.    <P>
<b>Third</b>, his acknowledgement that the Maturidis have an approach towards what he refers to as <u>al-sifaat al-hawaadith</u> (which are other than what they include within al-takwin) whereby they make these actions not matters established with Allaah's essence, but things outside of Allaah's essence, as in created things. We explained this matter in detail in <a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>Part 1</a> where it was stated that the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had certain approaches in explaining away the attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and from them was that the attributes are not established with Allah, but external to His essence, and are simply what is found in His creation of attributes, what He creates in others, and He can be said to possess them, just like we say about created entities like, "Allaah's She-Camel" and "Allaah's House." Thus, we have "Allaah's speech" and "Allaah's mercy" and so on, which are really just the speech and mercy found in the creation. So the Ash'aris and Maturidis borrowed this approach to deal with the <i><a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a></i> (to the Ash'arites) and the <i>sifaat hawaadith</i> (to the Maturidiyyah). Except that there is a difference between them on this matter and this should have become clear to you by reading <a href=indexc4a9.html?wfiba>Part 1</a>. Despite that difference, the actual goal and objective of them all (Ash'aris, Maturidis) is the same, they just simply took different approaches to deal with the same problem, and then argued over whose approach is more sound.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Kashmiris Comment on Another Chapter</font>    <P>
There is another very short comment that al-Kashmiri makes on another chapter in which al-Bukhari is every explicit in affirming recency (hadath) in Allaah's speech and action, which to us, means that Allaah's speech and action is tied to His will and power. So here is the full section, note the one sentence comment right at the end:    <P>

<b>Commentary:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Al-Kashmiri indicates al-Bukhari's intent, however, he uses the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> to characterize al-Bukhari's view and uses the phrase qiyaam <a href='tags/al-hawaadith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-hawaadith</font></a>. As for the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and the Salaf then it is to say that Allaah speaks with what He wills as He wills, that Allaah judges with what He wills as He wills, that Allaah commands with what He wills as He wills,  that Allaah acts as and when He wills and all of that is through His mashee'ah (will) and qudrah (power) and this is because He is an ever-living Lord that is neither dumb nor mute, rather He returns speech, and He is able to plot if His enemies plot, and His able to show enmity if His enemies show enmity, and He is able to love if His servants deserve that and He becomes angry and pleased if He so wishes. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots attempt to flee from all of this, using different types of fleeing, from them is saying actions are not established with Allaah but are merely what is in the creation, and from them is saying that actions are all one eternal attribute called al-takwin, and from them is saying Allaah is "outside of time" and so on.    <P>
As for Ahl al-Bid'ah, who operate upon the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology whose foundations they took from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>), then they have their own innovated language through which they characterize the truth, so as to make it subservient and subjugated to their own conceptions of what Allaah should and should not be described with.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
We can bring this to a close now, and there are some important lessons we can take from what has preceded  in this series:    <P>
<blockquote><b>One:</b> The difference between gutter-press swindlers and shysters like Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari and between those who have the decency and honesty through which they characterize correctly the views of the Salaf and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, albeit upon their own particular theological language. <a href='tags/muhammad-anwar-shah-al-kashmiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri</font></a> has demonstrated this and likewise, Abu al-Barakaat Nu'maan bin Mahmud al-Alusi (d. 1317H) was from those just and honest Hanafi Maturidis (who demonstrated this in his book <i>Jalaa' al-Aynayn Bi Muhaakamah al-Ahmadayn</i>).    <P>
<b>Two:</b> The presence of a group of people with few brain cells between their ears who upon <u>compound ignorance</u> or <u>pretence of ignorance</u> and the use of <u>gutter press methods</u> have no goal except to confuse, lie, distort, twist, fabricate and so on as it relates to the views of the Salaf and those who followed them like <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. These are the people who are unfortunately dominant today in the polemics against the followers of the Salafi aqidah in forums,  blogs, websites and so on. Aspiring Ash'aris and Maturidis should be astute and smart enough to realize this and act accordingly. Though, if they just simply abandoned aspiring for the dung, blood and puss which is with <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and simply went for the pure milk that is with the Salaf, they would feel refreshed, satiated and not have the problem of dealing with bad breath, as in, the horrible innovated language not known to any of the Salaf (and you would do real well to read <a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>this article on this matter</a>).    <P>
<b>Three:</b> Seeing through and above and beyond the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> in the characterization of the view of the Salaf, for what <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> refer to as "hulul al-hawaadith" or "qiyaam al-hawaadith" are nothing but Allaah's chosen actions, which are pure perfection, and which all factions are obligated to accept through overwhelming undeniable evidence in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Sunnah and ijmaa' of the Salaf of the first three centuries.    <P>
<b>Four:</b> By taking everything that has preceded which relates to Allaah's chosen actions (<b><a href='tags/afaal-ikhtiyaariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Af'aal Ikhtiyaariyyah</font></a></b>) which are not created (makhluq) - as al-Kashmiri has explained - and putting that alongside the issue of the <b>sifaat khabariyyah</b> (like face, hands, eyes) which the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> affirmed and the issue of <b><a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a></b>, which the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a> affirmed (both these matters are documented <u>extensively</u> on this site), the hujjah is now established upon the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and it is now <u>a criminal offence</u> to pretend to be ignorant of all of this, or to mischaracterize the aqidah of the Salaf and to slander the followers of that aqidah as being <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. We urge all followers of the Sunnah to watch out for these fraudsters and criminals and report them to us and bring them to us for corrective punishment. Because what they are really saying is that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> was a Mujassim Kaafir, and likewise his students were Mujassim Kafirs, and likewise al-Bukhari was a Mujassim Kaafir, and likewise the entirety of the Salaf, and likewise anyone who follows them and shuns the dung, blood and puss of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, they are all Mujassim Kafirs because they affirm "hawaadith," as they claim, for Allaah the Exalted. This is the reality of what they are saying through the tongue of disposition but dare not express through the tongue of flesh, out of pure cowardice, and where are these shysters compared to the insaaf (justice) of al-Kashmiri and al-Alusi, both Hanafi Maturidis?     <P>
<b>Five:</b> In spite of acknowledging the reality of the view of the Salaf, al-Kashmiri, being a Maturidi, deems the view of the Mutakallimin to be safer (aslam) and wiser (ahkam) than the way of the Salaf, and this is rejected from him. This is just a manifestation of the truth found in the speech of the Salaf, that once a person <u>enters kalaam</u>, he will find it extremely difficult to cleanse himself of it and see outside of it and beyond it.   </blockquote>    <P>
