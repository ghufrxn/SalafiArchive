<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
We were requested recently to comment on statement of creed issued by a person named <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> of Birmingham, who is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> / Maturidi in creed (the word "<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a>" is an umbrella term that includes the Maturidis, that's how most Maturidis themselves see it). A scan of a statement of creed written by this individual was sent to us on 5th April 2011. <u>We have  no idea when it was written</u>, but we commenced responding to it on 14th April 2011. In the commentary upon this statement, we will come to realize how today's Ash'aris do not really differentiate between the early Kullabi Ash'aris (who were much closer to Ahl al-Sunnah) and the <a href='tags/later-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Later Ash'aris</font></a> who reverted to many of the positions of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>, and left the way of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. At the same time, these contemporaries deceive themselves into thinking that what they are upon is the way of the Salaf, when the reality is that they are not even upon the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and his early students (the Kullaabi Ash'aris), let alone the way of the Salaf. Further, when they present their creed, it is presented in a deceptive manner using generalizations and vagueness, and the avoidance of any specificity and detail so as to allow a false ascription to the Salaf to be made in front of the audience.      <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The reader is advised to get a good solid grasp on the reality behind the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis and this can be done by studying the following two sets of very important articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> Is the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah</b> - <b><a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>Read Series Here</a></b>    <P>
<li> <b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> Against Ahl al-Sunnah - A Complete Historical Background and Context to <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and Its People</b> - <b><a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>Read Series Here</a> </b>  </ul>    <P>
Whilst there are lots of other articles on this site that are also important and beneficial, these two sets of articles will give you the best comprehension of the entire subject matter and give you an good overview of the deen of the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> and their various offshoots. With this background information, you will better comprehend this series of articles.     <P>
<b><u>Note:</u> It is not our intent to bring extensive quotations and discuss particular issues in detail, because all of the background knowledge and detailed discussions have already been covered in other articles. Equipped with that knowledge, it becomes very easy to identify Tajahhum and its practitioners and see their errors, mistakes and deceptions in their speech and writings. So all we will be doing in these articles is to make pointers.</b>   </div>    <P>
Before we start commenting on his statement, we should clarify that <b>all of those we have addressed previously on this site</b> have been proven to be dishonest, conniving, calculated people, whose lies are plain and manifest to see to anyone with even an ounce of sincerity and the desire for seeking truth.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These are people like Zubair (<a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>see here</a>), <a href='tags/abu-adam-naruiji.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Adam <a href="tags/naruiji.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Naruiji</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>see here</a>), the <a href='tags/philadelphian-jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philadelphian <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexa274.html?zrchw>see here</a>), the Ma'rifah blind-followers (<a href=indexeca4.html?inevm>see here</a>), the pretender Abu Layth (<a href=indexf4b8.html?qotsn>see here</a>), the deceiver <a href='tags/abdullah-ali-al-amin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Ali al-Amin</font></a> (<a href=index488d.html?gvutg>see here</a>), GF Haddaad and his babies, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a> et. al. (<a href=index4297.html?jwmpt>see here</a>, and <a href=indexc0a0.html?fmima>also here</a>), Nuh  Keller (<a href=index44f8.html?kwhwm>see here</a> and <a href=index03bc.html?mkboc>also here</a>), also Hamza Yusuf (<a href=index63a2.html?bnhcx>see here</a>) and others.</div>    <P>
So Allaah knows best about <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> how he will behave after the hujjah is established upon him that his orientation in creed (coming from the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidi schools) is founded originally upon a matter that the Salaf condemned and vilified, namely the blameworthy <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is the language of <i>al-ajsaam</i> and <i>al-a'raad</i> which he is trying so desperately to hide. What we find in practice is that as it becomes increasingly clear that the later As'haris had little to do with Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself and lost connection with him and that the Maturidis, from the very outset, were closer to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in creed than they were to the early <a href='tags/kullaabi-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabi Ash'aris</font></a>, <u>these people became more shrewd and more adept</u> in the way they formulate and present their creed to the masses so as to conceal many things (by ommission) and to give the false picture that they are following the Salaf by maintaining policy of speaking in generalizations devoid of tafseelaat (details).     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Asrar Rashid's Statement of Creed</font>    <P>
This is a scan of a hand written copy sent to us, and inshaa'Allaah we will translate the relevant excerpts and comment upon them:    <P>

<p><font class='titleHeadline'>A Piece of Advice to Contemporary Neo-Jahmites Posing as Followers of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and Abu al-Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a></font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In the previous five articles we made brief notes and remarks on a one-page statement of creed issued by <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a>. The crux of the matter is that <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> made a glittering display of his apparent (spurious) claim of following the way of the Salaf, <b>and by the time we go to the end of his one-page statement</b>, this deluded neo-Jahmite had already passed judgement upon the entirety of the Salaf and their followers that they have committed Shirk for saying that Allaah, the Exalted is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1593;&#1585;&#1588;&#1607;</span>), upon His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, which is in fact the consensus of the Salaf and  their ijmaa' is  reported by numerous authorities, from them Imaam al-Awzaa'ee (d. 157H), Qutaybah bin Sa'eed (d. 270H), the two Razis, Abu Zur'ah (d. 264H) and Abu Haatim (d. 277H), Zakariyyaa al-Saji (d. 307H), <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H), Abu Umar al-Talamankee (d. 429H), Abu Nasr al-Sijzi (d. 444H) and Abu Uthman al-Sabuni (d. 449H).</div>    <P>
<blockquote><b>Clearly, we have a problem here. <b>It is a problem of languages</b>. Asrar is trying to speak his foreign, alien language to us and we have to disappoint him here and tell him that we, like the Salaf, did not learn the language of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, that of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. The reason why these unsophisticated and unseasoned neo-Jahmites make unjust oppressive, slanderous accusations against what the Salaf and their followers are upon is because <u>they are trying to project their language onto ours</u>, and the two do not mix, they are trying to project the necessities (lawaazim) they see arising from their particular language (al-ajsaam wal-a'raaad) onto our language of the Book and the Sunnah. So we need to investigate this issue here briefly and concisely so as to establish the hujjah upon them further, and at the same time offer them some advice, perhaps that they may repent, and let go of that dung and blood they took from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>do yourself a huge favour and read this series of articles first</a>).</b></blockquote>    <P>
So here we go:    <P>
<blockquote>You should know dear reader, that just because there is <u>agreement in wording</u> between <u>a)</u> what is affirmed by the Salaf, their followers (and likewise, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their very early followers) with respect to Allaah's <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> (attributes) and <u>b)</u> what has been said by the people of falsehood from the people of <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>, who are the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, from the Raafidee <a href='tags/hishaamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hishaamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, it does not necessitate that one can impute to the Salaf and their followers the falsehood and misguidance of the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> and the Hanafi Mujaassimah from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, <b>because agreement in wording does not mean agreement in intent</b>.    <P>
The Salaf, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> say that Allaah has a face, hands, eyes as attributes of the essence, and then they differ. The Salaf simply say "<b>without asking how</b>" and this the methodology of the Salaf, the safest, most correct and most sound way, because the Sharee'ah came with <b>specific affirmation (of the sifaat) and general negation (of any likeness)</b>. But <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and the early followers, even though they affirmed these attributes, they errred by making <u>specific negation</u> alongside their specific affirmation, so they said, "<i>Allaah has hands which are not limbs</i>" and "<i>eyes which are not pupils</i>" and what is similar to this. While in meaning this is certainly the truth, <u>it is a methodological departure from the way of the Salaf</u> when it comes to making assertions and coroborrations of one's creed. This is because making <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> in negation opposes the methodology of the Salaf, just as making <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> in affirmation. Thus, there is a difference between saying, "<i>Allaah has hands, without how</i>" and between "<i>Allaah has hands which are not limbs or instruments</i>". In any case, despite this, we see that the Salaf, and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and their very early followers (and al-Bayhaqi) are all united against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this matter of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah, and they refuted the false ta'weels and tahreefs of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in this regard.    <P>
Now, just because the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a> also affirm Allaah has a face, hands and so on, and they treat these attributes to be like the limbs and instruments in the creation, <u>then that falsehood is unique to them</u>, and the agreement in affirmation does not mean the agreement in the realities that either faction posits for these attributes. The Salaf affirm that there are haqaa'iq (realities) for these attributes, but that these realities are unlike those of the creation, and we do not have any knowledge of the realities of these attributes. As for the Raafidee <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, they make the same affirmation, but posit these attributes as limbs and enter into repugnant <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>From here, for anyone to accuse the one who affirms these attributes, the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> khabariyyah dhaatiyyah, for Allaah, the Exalted, without asking how, as being one who affirms limbs and instruments for Allaah is either grossly ignorant or an oppressive lying, treacherous, misguided, wandering strayer, who has done nothing but expose his own resentment towards what the Salaf were upon (and <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and al-Ash'ari) in this subject matter, and has proven that he is diseased with that poison of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that both <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> were opposing,  let alone the Salaf as a whole.</div>    <P>
Likewise, the Salaf said, "<i>Allaah is upon / above His Throne</i>," and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> also say, "<i>Allaah is upon / above His Throne</i>," yet we see the Salaf saying, "<i><u>without how</u></i>" and the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> saying, "<i>He is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (body), and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becomes filled with Him, and He equals <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> in width, or does not extend beyond it</i>..." and so on using a type of language in <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> <u>which actually follows on from the conclusion they reached through their ilm al-kalaam</u>, that of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad which they used to demonstrate their proof of huduth al-ajsaam, and through which they initially concluded that Allaah must be a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a> (upon the particular way they defined it). This falsehood <u>is unique to them</u>, and the Salaf and their followers are free of it, and it is an oppressive, criminal judgement that one equates between the two sayings in terms of what is intended by them. This is because <b>the Hanafi Karraamiyyaah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> are operating within the jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (<i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>) and the Salaf are outside of that  jurisdiction</b>, they never entered it and saw it as utter misguidance.     <P>
The point here is that when people like <a href='tags/asrar-rasheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rasheed</font></a> and the plethora of other deluded, misguided wanderers who live in cloud-cuckoo land thinking they are following the creed of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> make statements like the following:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever claimed that Allaah, the Exalted is in something, or from something, or upon something, then he has committed shirk, since if He was upon something, He would be carried (mahmool), and if He was in something, He would be surrounded (mahsoor) and if he  was from something, He would be originated (<a href='tags/muhdath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhdath</font></a>).</blockquote>    <P>
Then they should realize that <b>the people they are really addressing are their own cousins, brethren in that blameworthy ilm al-kalaam</b> which the Salaf condemned, meaning here, the Hanafi Karraamiyah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. This is because these parties have agreed between themselves that it is permissible to use the language of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> in speech about Allaah and the associated necessities (lawaazim), and thus, <b>it is only they who are bound by the jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and whatever necessities are required by it</b>. It was the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'araad</i> (bodies and their incidental attributes) and the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (origination of bodies), on the basis of which:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The Jahmiyyah</b> denied names, attributes and actions for Allaah (because they amounted to <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i>, incidental attributes and would render Allaah a body, and thus clash with the proof),     <P>
<li> <b>The Mu'tazilah</b> denied the attributes and actions (because they amounted to <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>, incidental attributes and would render Allaah a body, and thus clash with the proof),     <P>
<li> And in the other direction, <b>the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</b> concluded Allaah must be a body otherwise attributes cannot be affirmed for Him, so they went in a different direction in trying to adhere to <u>the core premises</u> of the  proof of huduth al-ajsaam. However, they argued that Allaah is a body yet unlike other bodies (<i>jism laa kal-ajsaam</i>), and whilst they were mostly free of the gross <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> of the Raafidee Mutakallimeen, they entered into a type of <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> when they spoke of Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, and this <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a> followed on from the conclusion they had already reached through that condemned <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, that Allaah is a <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>.</ul>    <P>
So all of this speech of "...<i>if He was upon something, <u>He would be</u> such and such and if He was in something, <u>He would be</u> such and such and if He was from something, <u>He would be</u> such and such</i>...." this is really an <u>inter-kalaam polemical discourse</u> and it has nothing to do with Ahl al-Sunnah because Ahl al-Sunnah do not subscribe to that <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> in their creed such that these types of necessities should be made binding upon them. <b>This is not the language of Ahl al-Sunnah</b>, it is the language of those who opted for the disease and sickness of previous nations, like the Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> who thought that the greatest philosophy of the day (the conceptual tools of the Greeks, and Aristotle's <i>al-jawhar wal-'arad</i> in particular) could assist them in theological matters. It is here we strongly recommend that if you have not already done so, <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>you need to read these five articles</a> that deal with this subject matter in detail.   </blockquote>    <P>
In short, the message is that we, as the followers of the Salaf, are not deceived by that pretence of piety displayed by the likes of <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> and ignoramuses like him who claim that their particular theological language in describing Allaah and speaking about Him is more superior than what Allaah Himself said, and what His Messenger said and what the Salaf said - because when Asrar implies that to say Allaah is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1593;&#1585;&#1588;&#1607;</span>) is tantamount to shirk, because "it means this and it means that" and so on, he has just proven to the audience that his aql left him a long time ago, and fell by the wayside somwhere in Syria, and he needs to get a grip on reality and the abc's of history, and he needs to realize that this language and these necessities he speaks of are the very ones for which the Salaf condemned, scorned and vilified the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> factions who were present in their time, be they Mu'attilah or <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, even though the Mu'attilah were the most dangerous to the Ummah.     <P>
Hence, we are not in need of your language, just like the Salaf were not in need of your language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> in theological matters, and <u>you were the very people</u> that the Salaf attacked for entering into this misguidance and using it to speak about Allaah and His attributes, and all of the statements of the Salaf in condemnation of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> are referring to this particular <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>, and not the genus of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, so don't try to deceive us with that worn out tactic of using the term "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" in a broader sense to refer to the genus of speech in theological matters. We are speaking of the specific <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> which is what the Salaf condemned, the language of al-ajsaam wa-a'raad which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Raafidah, <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah founded their creed upon. So alhamdulillaah, the spurious claim of <a href='tags/asrar-rashid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asrar Rashid</font></a> in ascribing to the Salaf, when the Salaf are in one land, and Asrar is on an altogether different planet, is so plain to see.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>The Salaf have a particular language</b>, it is simply a language of affirmation of what is in the revealed texts with a general negation of any likeness. They do not see any conflict between reason and revelation, revelation guides and reason submits and follows and sound, uncorrupted reason has no objection to what comes in revelation pertaining to the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>. Ahl al-Sunnah believe that there is absolutely no likeness unto Allaah, as a result, no false analogies can be made for Allaah, and hence, as Allaah's essence is unlike all other essences, the necessities (lawaazim) that are said of all created things and bodies do not and cannot apply to Him. As a result, there is absolutely no caution in affirming what Allaah affirmed for Himself with a general negation of <a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>. This creed is completely outside of the jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>, because the Messenger (alayhis salaam) came to do away with all false speech concerning Allaah, the Exalted, from which is the speech of the Hellenized Jews, Christian and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>. This is what is alluded to by Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) who said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "<i>Dhamm ul-Kalaam</i>":    <P>

<blockquote>The Tawheed of the people of knowledge and the jamaa'ah of the Muslims is "<i>I testify none is worthy of worship except Allaah (alone) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah</i>". And the Tawheed of the people of falsehood is disputing about al-a'raad (incidental attributes) and al-ajsaam (bodies) and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent with the rejection of that.</blockquote>    <P>
And as for the Innovators, strayers, <b>the factions of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, have another language</b>, which operates on the presumption of conflict between reason and revelation, and this language they operate upon is what they took from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> of the <a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> those nations had already indulged in and which led them to the same "negative theology" that the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> of Islaam adopted in speech about Allaah (meaning, making use of specific negations in describing Allaah as a prominent feature of their theological speech). And the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> try to <u>qualify the speech of Allaah and His Messenger</u> with this particular language of theirs. These were the people referred to as "<b>people of desires</b>" when they were doing this in the time of the Salaf. They were looked down upon, scorned, despised, abased, humiliated and considered as diseased, who also disease the hearts of others.    <P>
So we have <u>two different languages</u> and the necessities required by the language of <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> <b>do not apply</b> to the people of the Sunnah and Aathaar, for the simple reason than dung and blood (ilm al-kalaam which is the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad) do not mix with pure milk (the revealed texts). Thus when a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> mu'attil says "<i>if you say Allaah is this, it  <u>necessitates</u> He is this</i>," his whole speech is around trying to negate the  <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) belonging to ajsaam (bodies) and operating upon the lawaazim (necessities) that apply with respect to them in what is observed in this creation. Given this, his speech is contextually restricted and <u>can only apply</u> to the other set of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> loonies that entered into this matter, and they happen to be the Hanafi Karraaamiyyah <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>. None of this applies to Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the Righteous Salaf because they did not subscribe to this language and agree to speak about Allaah upon its rules and necessities.    <P>
This is similar to when a person walks by a supermarket and then an employee from that supermarket - who has subscribed to the dress code, rules, regulations, ethics and  language required by the employer - tries to impose the way he is required to act and behave and speak upon the one who is not an employee and has not agreed upon such code, ethics, language or behaviour. While two employees may dispute as to what is right and wrong about any particular matter, based upon the underlying rules, regulations, culture, ethics etc. of the employer, this discussion is foreign and alien to the one who is not an employee and nothing is binding upon him and no necessities can be imposed upon him.    <P>
And this is how it is, so when a <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> Mu'attil says, "<i>If you say Allaah is above, <u>it necessitates</u> He must be a body</i>", then that is a dispute between them and the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> from <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>, like the Hanafi <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> - because they all agreed to make the language of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i> to be the foundation of their creed. It has nothing to do with Ahl al-Sunnah, and Ahl al-Sunnah are not obliged to incorporate these necessities which they see as false in the first place, because they are founded and rely upon <u>false analogies</u> being made for Allaah (<i>qiyas al-shumool, qiyas al-ghaa'ib alaa ash-shaahid, qiyas al-tamtheel</i>).    <P>
It is with this understanding that you will realize why the Salaf never debated these diseased individuals and it was not from their methodology to speak or debate with them, it was only refutation, warning, and vilification of them in front of the people, because once you agree to speak to them and debate with them, <b>there is an implied understanding that you have agreed to enter and come under their <u>jurisdiction</u> of kalaam</b>, because all their speech with you will be founded upon the requirements and the necessities of the language of al-ajsaam wal-a'raad.So when you engage them, this is what they want you to enter into. And this is what happens to many people when they attempt to refute the Ash'aris and Maturidis, but without being properly equipped and not having the tact in knowing how to deal with them, they get caught up and the end result is that the innovator succeeds in causing at least some element of confusion and doubt, if not actually convincing anyone with his baatil outright - and we see this frequently on the forums, blogs etc. So you have to really understand this issue of "<b>jurisdiction</b>," the language and necessities of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> do not apply to us, and we are outside of its jurisdiction. If you go back and read the accounts of the debates of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, you will see <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> not entering into their jurisdiction of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and they failed to bait <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> in this regard, he was too smart and clever for them, walhamdulillaah, and he debased and humiliated those slimey, conniving <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> walhamdulillaah. You will also see this observation of ours with respect to Abdul Azeez al-Kinaani al-Makki's (d. 240H) account of his debate with that diseased Bishr al-Mareesee al-Hanafi al-Jahmee, in the book <i>al-Haydah</i>. So a Sunni, Salafi, Athari has to be wise with these things and not be stung by these heretics, and he ought to know how they should be addressed, (<u>from a position of authority</u>), subsequently subdued, tied up with their hands behind their backs, their necks to their knees, disciplined with the leafless branches of palm trees (as per the advice of Imaam al-Shaafi'ee) and then rolled into a nearby ditch for good measure - and this is simply a metaphor for educational purposes - and it is being used to illustrate how a Sunni Muthabbit ought to manifest his superiority in argument over the Jahmee Mu'attil, such that it is as if he has physically subdued him and owned him.</blockquote></div>    <P>
So the advice here to Asrar and his likes is to go and get a grip on reality and go and learn some objective history about your ancestors from the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> <u>and how they were treated by the Salaf between 100-300H</u>, and we will be so kind and generous so as to point you in the right direction to help you lift the blindness:    <P>
