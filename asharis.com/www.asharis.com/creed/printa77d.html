<div class='sidebar'>Some of the neo-Jahmiyyah posing as followers of Abu al-Hasan <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/al-ashari.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/ashari.cfm" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> [or perhaps they are Maturidis] have tried to fabricate lies upon the Imaam and Mufassir, <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/ibn-jarir-al-tabari.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jarir al-Tabari</font></a> (d. 310H) by presenting <u>clipped, incomplete, decontextualized quotations</u> from his works with a view to deceiving the audience. As you will realize from these articles, <b>this action is very blatant and calculated</b>. The shyster behind this activity, called Zubair, has only testified against his own self, and proved nothing except his own dishonesty as we will see in what follows. In this series we will provide the aqidah of Imaam al-Tabari and exonerate him from the lies of these dishonest people, by Allaah's permission.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
When a <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/jahmite.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> is bold enough to lie against Allaah that He is not above His <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/throne.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and does not have the attributes of face,  hands and eyes (<u>all as attributes of His essence</u>) despite Allah having affirmed that for Himself and the entirety of the Salaf (<u>and the very early Kullaabis and Ash'aris</u>) having taken all of that with acceptance (with negation of <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/tamtheel.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a> and without any <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/taweel.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and tafweed), and similarly when a <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/jahmite.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> belies the Messenger (alayhis salaam) in these matters, then it is of no surprise that this <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/jahmite.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> will think anything of lying upon the Salafi scholars and attributing to them what they are free of or twisting their words upon other than what they meant or decontextualizing their statements in order deceive the unsuspecting audience. <u>This is not surprising to say the least</u>. So we have one of these such <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/jahmites.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who tried it on with the following:    <P>
<img src=../../snn/www.asharis.comm/assets/images/tabari-aqidah-gems.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
First of all note how there are not any references given, as in page numbers and editions, which is common practice with these people when it comes to these particular types of citations. But it makes sense, if you want to commit a crime, you've got to make sure you make it as difficult as possible to unravel, so you can't really fault the Jahmee for this. They need to make it as difficult as possible for people to go and verify for themselves and to see what is <u>actually</u> being said. They drop a few quotations, the audience who does not know any better, laps it up like milk, and the shyster will even receive a few pats on the back through the comments section, "Hey, well done, I am learning so much!" So this is the type of operational scam that is going on here.     <P>
<img src=../../snn/www.asharis.comm/assets/images/clown.gif align=right border=0>Further, many of these people themselves <u>are complete ignoramuses</u>, they don't even have a clue about <u>their own theology</u>, but they think they know it. And with this flawed, deficient understanding of their own theology, they then approach the sayings of the Salafi scholars, only to completely misunderstand and misapply them. So this is the type of clown we are dealing with here. For an in-depth illustration of what has just been mentioned in this paragraph, please study <a href=indexde2c.html?cdaws>the antics of this clown</a> which we covered in detail. That will give you a standard benchmark with which to judge the circus performances that these <a href='http://snn/www.asharis.comm/tags/jahmites.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are doing these days.    <P>
Now this shyster has brought five or so matters in the above post and we will try to address them one by one inshaa'Allaah.   <P>




<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Jarir al-Tabari Discussing Allaah's Place (Makaan) and Tanaqqul, Taghayyur</font>    <P>
In <a href=indexb5ff.html?zrfjw>Part 3</a> we addressed a quote ascribed to al-Tabari by this very dishonest individual which is as follows:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>-He says in his tafsir, "Indeed Allah ta'ala negated regarding Himself through it (the following): change (Taghayur), movement (tanaqqul) from one place to another, occurrence of change which occurs in humans and other creation,"</blockquote>    <P>
We have now been informed of the quote and checking it in a print version, it is in volume 3, page 194 of the Dar Ihyaa al-Turath, Beirut, 2001 print of  Jaami al-Bayaan, at the beginning of the tafseer of the Surah Aali Imraan. As we said, <u>never, ever, ever trust a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> in citation</u>. Let's look at the full quote and compare it to what is above:    <P>
The discussion is about the meaning of "al-Qayyum" and al-Tabari has cited the views of Mujaahid and Rabee' who say that it means (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1600;&#1609; &#1603;&#1604; &#1588;&#1610;&#1569;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1600;&#1610;&#1600;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1600;&#1609; &#1603;&#1604; &#1588;&#1610;&#1569; &#1610;&#1603;&#1604;&#1572;&#1607; &#1608;&#1610;&#1581;&#1601;&#1592;&#1607; &#1608;&#1610;&#1585;&#1586;&#1602;&#1607;</span>) which basically mean, the one who maintains everything, the one who preserves, safeguards and provides for everything.    <P>
After bringing these sayings, he then says:    <P>

Here is the translation with comments (and you will soon realize what this Jahmee Kadhaab tried to hide):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And others said: ...</blockquote>    <P>
So this is not the saying of al-Tabari but he is citing the views of others! So here the great lie is exposed, and al-Tabari is free of the fabrication against him.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And others said: The meaning of that is <i>al-qiyaam alaa makaanihi</i> (established in His place), and His angles in [having] permanent establishment alongside which there is no cessation (zawaal) and no transformation (intiqaal). And that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, negated from Himself through it [i.e. al-Qayyum],  taghayyur (change) and tanaqqul (movement) from a place to another, and the occurrence of transformation which occurs in humans, and in all of His creation besides them (humans). </blockquote>    <P>
A number of things here.     <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> In this view, there is affirmation of makaan (place) for Allaah. This is considered kufr to all Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologists, since in this view Allah does not move from His place (makaan), which means He has a "place" according to this view al-Tabari is citing.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> As we explained in the article on the term "<i>hulul al-hawaadith</i>" (<a href=index6d7d.html?ynxqc>see here</a>), that there are certain things denied for Allaah, such as the change which occurs in created things (meaning deterioration and what is similar to this) and likewise that Allaah does not acquire attributes He never had before and likewise Allaah does not create anything in His own essence. No doubt all of this is denied for Allaah. However, Allaah having speech and action tied to His will and power does not come under that type of deficient change, rather it is pure perfection. This is what the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> aim to deny by labelling it as "hawaadith" and "taghayyur" and the likes, and this is to remain consistent with their proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>, and they claim that it means Allaah must be "creating" in His own essence, and this is pure baatil (falsehood) and we will address this more fully in a separate article. </blockquote>    <P>
However, as we will see, al-Tabari does not consider this explanation to be correct. In any case, he mentions the one who held this view:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>A mention of who said that: Ibn Humayd narrated to me, he said: Salamah, from Umar bin Ishaq, from Muhammad bin Ja'far bin al-Zubayr, [who said: Al-Qayyum, the one who is established in His place (makaan) with His authority over His creation, never ceasing. And <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> had ceased (to be) in their saying, meaning the saying of the Ahbaar (learned sages) who debated with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) from the people of Najraan regarding <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a>, that he ceased from the place he was and went to other than it.</blockquote>    <P>
So the argument here (in what al-Tabari is presenting) is that since <a href='tags/eesaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eesaa</font></a> was not permanently established in a place (makaan) but rather ceased and went away from it, then he cannot be divine, as in cannot be al-Qayyum. Again, nothing in this for the Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologists, in fact, this view too is plain manifest kufr to them.    <P>
Then al-Tabari explains:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>But the more worthy of the two explanations of being correct is what is said by Mujaahid and Rabee' and that it is a description from Allaah, exalted be His remembrance, of His self that He is the one who maintains the affair of every single thing in its sustenance, and repelling (harm) from it, and preserving it, regulating it, managing it with His power,  [as is] the saying of the Arabs, "So and so is qaa'im over the affair of this city" meaning by that: The one holding authority over the regulation of its affair.</blockquote>    <P>
So al-Tabari holds on to this view and maintains that the meaning of al-Qayyum is "<i>the one who maintains the affair of every single thing in its sustenance, and repelling (harm) from it, and preserving it, regulating it, managing it with His power</i>." Allaahu Akbar! What more needs to be said.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes</font>    <P>
First thing is, always remember, <u>never, ever, ever</u> trust a Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theologist in his citation of Salafi scholars. He has an operative motive to justify his baatil and to gain legitimacy through it. Second, as you can see this is an exemplification of <u>great treachery</u> on behalf of this individual called Zubair, and there are multiple crimes involved here. We hope that this individual hastily repents to Allaah, and puts up a repentance and exonerates al-Tabari from the fabrications he tried to impute to him. For al-Tabari is <b>a Salafi, Sunni, Athari</b> imaam who afffirms Allaah's <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascent), nuzul (descent), majee' (coming) and <a href='tags/ityaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ityaan</font></a> (arrival) - without how - and he is innocent of the Jahmee filth this individual tried to malign him with! Instead, this individual should write an article containing al-Tabari's tafseer of the verses mentioning <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, majee' and nuzul as part of his repentance, and also post the parts from <i>al-Tabseer Fee Ma'aalim al-Deen</i> which contain a refutation of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who deny the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a> Khabariyyah (these were listed in <a href=index4606.html?nlpdj>Part 1</a>), and in particular, al-Tabaris' lengthy refutation of those who denied al-nuzul using the standard Jahmee argument.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Finally, it should be noted that it is these types of unscrupulous people who create more problems than need be between Muslims. That's why we are very harsh against these types of people and use <u>appropriate and befitting</u> language for them. These people need to be wiped out from the scene completely. They add to the great confusion there already is by combining between their own meagre, poor understanding and between lying upon scholars, fabricating upon them and twisting their words and statements. But not all of them are like this, there are people out there who are sincere and  wish for truth. Unfortunately, (for us), it is mostly these types of shysters that happen to come our way and  hence we have to deal with them in a particular way to make an example of them. It would otherwise be possible to have meaningful dialogues and discussions with honest truth-seeking <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and Maturidis in the absence of this species of dishonest <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> and this layer of deception that is taking place on a very big and wide scale by these types of people. They find no way to support their Hellenized <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> theology except throught this type of activity where they try to justify their own <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> doctrines by inventing lies upon Salafi Imaams, twisting their sayings and imputing to them, that which they are free of.</div>    <P>
