<p>In his lecture on the biography of <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> one amongst the <a href='tags/jahmite-asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite Ash'aris</font></a> of Philadelphia said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In those foundations of the religion Ahl us-Sunnah have three madhhabs there are three madhhabs in the usool ud-deen ...</blockquote>    <P>
And this is a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> fabrication - there was only one madhhab in creed during the time of the Sahaabah and the Taabi'een until the Imaam of the Mu'attilah - Jahm ibn Safwan - founded the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, part of which was negation of the Attributes, and <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>the historical background of that is covered here</a> - and (there was only one madhhab) until he was followed in that by his <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> followers   and then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who took <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> from the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>.    <P>
However, this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari wants to confuse the people and make them think that there are three valid approaches to Allaah's Attributes, one which is that of the Salaf - and the others being the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools - which are really extensions of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'tazilites - all their usool are the same.    <P>
And when the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> arose the rejection of the Salaf against them was severe. However this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> wants to deceive and to confuse ...     <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> ... there is one, the madhhab of Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar, the People of the Hadeeth and Narrations. Their madhhab is a very simplistic madhhab. We believe in whatever came in <a href='tags/the-quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Quran</font></a></font></a> and the Sunnah, as it came without divulging into how, or what it means or giving a tafseer or talking in detail. We don't do all of that. But when Allaah describes himself we know there is nothing like Allaah subhaanah wa ta'aalaa.</blockquote>    <P>
What the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari is insinuating here is that the early Salaf just had a simplistic approach - and in saying this, these words include a belittlement of the Salaf - because what they are saying in essence (and this is their real intent) is that all the Salaf did was to acknowledge the text, pass it on, and didn't really fathom things and the truth wasn't really made manifest and codified until <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and al-Maturidi came along. This is what the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> means to say, or what he is leading towards, so the way of the Salaf is "safer (aslam)", but the way of the khalaf (i.e. the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a>, the theologians) is "wiser, more precise" (ahkam).     <P>
They hold that from the time of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) for three centuries up until the likes of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'ari</font></a> and al-Maturidi and al-Baqillani and their likes came along - no one really grasped or explained the aqeedah and they cannot ascribe ignorance to the Salaf directly - hence they say, that the way of the Salaf is  "safer" but their way is "wiser", and they say there are "three" schools of thought. The intent is to ascribe ignorance to the Salaf and knowledge and erudition to the khalaf.    <P>
And likewise, avoiding ascribing ignorance to the Salaf, they say, "there are three schools of thought", and by saying this they want to legitimize their own <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> creed, whose Imaam and founder is Jahm Ibn Safwan - and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> acquired <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> acquired much of the usool (foundations) of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and they are all upon <a href='tags/tateel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'teel</font></a> because what they made to be the fundamental part of their religion, which is proving the createdness of the universe through "<a href="tags/substance.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">substance</font></a>" (<a href='tags/jawhar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jawhar</font></a>) and "<a href="tags/accident.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">accident</font></a>" (<a href='tags/arad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>'arad</font></a>) and the indivisible particle (<a href='tags/al-jawhar-al-fard.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jawhar al-Fard</font></a>), it required them to deny Allaah's Attributes, otherwise they would have been made a laughing stock in front of those whom they were debating (the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and their likes), since their proof would have been falsified on account of what is found in the Book and the Sunnah of affirmation of Attributes for Allaah.    <P>
Thus, you see them describing the way of the Salaf in this manner, "a simplistic approach". The reality is that the way of the Salaf is to affirm the texts, affirm that they have meanings, and to pass on the texts exactly as they have come without likening the reality of those attributes to the creation (<a href='tags/tamtheel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamtheel</font></a>), and without devising and ascribing other meanings to these texts (<a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a>), and this is what some of the Salaf meant when they said, "bilaa kayf wa laa ma'naa" (without specifying how and without any meaning). And this refutes both the Mukayyifah, those specifying a "how" which are the <a href='tags/mushabbihah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mushabbihah</font></a>, and also it refutes the Mu'awwilah, those who devise new meanings and interpretations, intending by that to negate the attribute - But this is  a subject for another article. You should simply note at this point that there are two schools of thought amongst the Ash'aris - those who adhere to <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> and those who adhere to tafweed. But those who make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> refute those who make tafweed claiming that it is an affront to say that texts came devoid of meanings. So they have differences amongst themselves and in fact in most of their usool, they have many differences, and that is a subject for another article.    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So if a person says "Allaah's Hand is over their hands" [a verse in the Qur'aan] and he puts his own hand up to say like ... over, his hand should be cut off, see this was their madhhab. They were very strict on that, so a person ... and the Imaam of this madhhab was <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> Ibn Hanbal rahimahullaah. </blockquote>    <P>
The Salaf showed rejection against the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> and the rejection they showed against the Mu'attilah was multiple times more - and this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> feigns ignorance of that. For what we find of the works of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, and from what has been narrated from him regarding the corruption of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and the Mu'attilah in general, is abundantly more so than his speech on the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a> - alongside the repugnance of <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a>. So why is he saying or implying that the Imaam of this madhhab (of rejecting <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> and tajseem) was <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>, when we find that what <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> has written and spoken in regard to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and Mu'attilah is multiple times more than what he spoke regarding the <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>.     <P>
So this is deception from this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari. Rather, it should be truthfully said that <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was an Imaam in standing up to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the Ahl ul-Kalaam and <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> refuted Jahm Ibn Safwaan who is the Imaam of the Mu'attilah and who is the root of much of what the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> are upon.    <P>
And what about the Salaf's rejection of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in general - who are the Imaams of the Mu'attilah - how many books did they write entitled "ar-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah" - until Nu'aym bin Hammaad (d. 228H) alone <u>wrote thirteen books against the Jahmites</u>, as Imaam <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> says about him in as-Siyar. So what happened to Imaam Ahmad's annihilation of the Mu'attilah - those who negated Allaah's <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a> and who negated His Attributes?    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So if a person tries to say <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> rahimahullaah tabaaraka wa ta'aalaa believed Allaah ta'aalaa was a physical body or was a huge figure sitting on a <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and tries to ascribe that to his madhhab, that person has no understanding whatsoever of the madhhab of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal or the Ahl ul-Hadeeth. </blockquote>    <P>
Look at this talbees (deception), and look at this revilement upon the Book and the Sunnah and the creed of the Salaf. What they mean to say is that saying "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>" exactly as Allaah said, necessitates that He is a "body" - to understand why they say this, <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>you need to read this article</a>. Their denial of the attributes is in order to avoid falsifying what they made to be the foundation of their entire religion which is demonstrating the createdness of the universe through a rational argument called "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", the createdness of bodies - which is the foundation of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> - but this forces them to negate the Attributes, because affirming the Attributes would falsify their rational argument.    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Their methodology was that we believe in it as it came and we don't divulge into the kayf, so Allaah ta'aalaa,  "ar-Rahmaan alal <a href='tags/arsh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arsh</font></a> istiwaa" bilaa kayf, so Allaah ta'aalaa made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, Ar-Rahmaan did <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> upon <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> without how, without howness. meaning we don't add any other word, no descriptive word is added to that right there and we leave it just as it is.     <P>
We don't say "bi dhaatihi", we dont' say "bi hadd" we don't say "imtala'a minhu al-arsh", I'm going to translate, we don't say He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over his <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> in his essence or in himself, that He himself went over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, we don't say that because Allaah did not say that, if Allaah wanted to say that it would have been in the aayah right, Allaah would have said that if He wanted it to be said, but he didn't say that so we stop where the revelation stops, that's it.    <P>
So this was their methdology, we don't say Allaah made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> on <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> "bi hadd", with a limit, with a boundary, with a barrier. So he made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and then there is a barrier between him and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, that's the <a href='tags/takyeef.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takyeef</font></a>, thats giving it a kaifiyyah that's, a modality and they did not used to say that. They didn't say that He made <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> became full of Him and He descends to the first  heaven without <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a> becoming empty of him. They did not say nothing like that ...some people who came later who were Hanbalees said some of that stuff [with a snug smile on his face] .... OK Ibn Taymiyah used to say that [laughter from audience] he is the one who used to say that... this was not the methodology of the early Hanbalee scholars and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaahu ta'aalaa) himself. So this needs to be kept in mind.     <P>
So I'm saying, I'm mentioning it like this because <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (rahimahullaahu ta'aalaa) was the first, he was the first of this madhhab and he was the first from whom it was popularized. And these scholars, these were the Ahl ul-Hadeeth, the People of the Hadeeth, and that name says it all. If anybody in Philly, says that they are from Ahl ul-Hadeeth, yet they add to the hadeeth what is not from the  hadeeth, you tell them akhee, you cannot be from Ahl ul-Hadeeth if your are adding to the hadeeth what the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) didn't say in the hadeeth. Stick to that name, if you want to take that name for yourself (i.e. Ahl ul-Hadeeth), stick to that name and don't go outside of it. Say what the hadeeth says and be silent. Don't say, "bi hadd", with a bound... don't say with a boundary, because it did not come in a hadeeth or in an athar. It did not come from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) ... </blockquote>    <P>
So he claims that the Ahl ul-Hadeeth were simply silent in transmitting and narrating the texts, and that they never - in relation to any of these texts used any additional phrases. So they did not say "bi haddin", or to say "bi dhaatihi" (and this would include other phrases such as "baa'inun min khalqihi") and that these are the additions of the later people - whom he pours his abuse upon - such as the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and so on.     <P>
And we need to address the claims of this <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari, his claim that the the simplistic madhhab of the Ahl ul-Hadeeth (of which he says <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was the main representative) did not speak with anything more that is in the Hadeeth (on in the Aayaat, Verses).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Clarification of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari's Assertion that the Ahl ul-Hadeeth Did Not Know The Meanings of What Has Come in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah in Relation to Allaah's Attributes</font>    <P>
He said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We believe in whatever came in <a href='tags/the-quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Quran</font></a></font></a> and the Sunnah, as it came without divulging into how, <b>or what it means</b> or giving a tafseer or talking in detail. We don't do all of that. But when Allaah descirbes himself we know there is nothing like Alaah subhaanah wa ta'aalaa.</blockquote>    <P>
This will be dealt with in a separate article inshaa'Allaah    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Clarification of the Issue: Bi Dhaatihi (With His Essence)</font>    <P>
In the very early times, it is certainly true that the Scholars, the people of hadeeth, narrated the akhbaar (narrations) and passed them on - since there was no dispute and there was no confusion as to the meanings of the narrations. Thus, everyone understood, knew and believed that Allaah is above the heavens, above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a>, and that Allaah is described with Attributes such as Hearing, Seeing, and other such as Hands, Face, Anger, Pleasure and so on. So they passed on these narrations, negating there is any likeness for Allaah or for His Attributes and that these Attributes are in a manner that befit His Majesty. They never distinguished between Attributes mentioned in the Qu'raan or attributes mentioned in the Sunnah (which was a later innovation), and they did not distinguish between the Attributes either - they affirmed all of them and negating any likeness from them and nor did they explain them away with the ta'weels of the later people.    <P>
Then there arose the likes of Ja'd bin Dirham and Jahm Ibn Safwaan in the early part of the second century, and they began to cast doubt about Allah being above His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and about His Names and Attributes. And the reason they did this was because they devised a rational argument to prove the universe has a creator, through which they debated the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> of other nations and religions. However, this rational argument necessitated that Allaah too is created, unless all His attributes are negated in order to remain consistent with this proof. So they began to reject the narrations, and start making <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> of the texts and so on. <a href=indexa66c.html?dhpom>The historical background of that is covered here</a>.    <P>
So when they (and their subsequent followers and offshoots, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Mu'tazilah) began to cast aspersions and make false ta'weels (interpolations) and started saying that Allaah has no attributes,  is everywhere, and that <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a> (ascending over the Throne) means "conquering", and that it is not Allaah that descends, but his "mercy" or his and that it is not Allaah that will arrive or come on the Day of Judgement (as occurs in Surah al-Fajr) but His "mercy" or His "command" and that His "Hand" means His Power and that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not Allaah's speech but it is something created and so on - then the Scholars of Ahl ul-Hadeeth stood to rebut them and to expose their falsehood because these people did not stop where the narrations stopped, rather they exceeded the limits and brought meanings from themselves, and so they distorted and played with the texts and violated the sanctity of these texts.    <P>
So the first of those to use expressions other than those of the Book and the Sunnah were the straying <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and all those who followed something of their legacy (which includes the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Ash'ariyyah), and those who suffered from Hellenistic (Greek) philosophical influences.      <P>
And using the issue of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> (Allaah's highness above the creation) as an example, when the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> began to say: "Istiwaa is metaphorical (majaaz)", the Ahl ul-Hadeeth made the matter clear that Allaah is ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> with His Essence (dhaat) and that Allaah is above the creation with His Essence (dhaat). And we see this reported in abundance about the early Salaf, the people of hadeeth.    <P>
Imaam al-Awzaa'ee (d. 157H) said as reported by al-Bayhaqee in al-Asmaa was-Sifaat (p.408) and Fath ul-Baaree (13/406):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We while the Taabi'een were many used to say: Verily, Allaah the Exalted is upon (alaa) His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> and we have faith in what has been reported in the authentic Sunnah of His Attributes.</blockquote>     <P>
Shaikh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said as occurs in Majmoo al-Fataawaa (5/39):     <P>

So after this time, the Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar spoke and clarified the truth from falsehood and they explained that when Allaah says "Allaah ascended above the Throne", that it indeed is Allaah Himself who ascended above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, as that is manifestly and perfectly clear - no one denying this except one blind in vision and insight. So the scholars spoke until their clarifications and expressions became well known ...    <P>
Abu Nasr as-Sijzee (d.444) said in al-Ibaanah of as-Sijzee as quoted from Mukhtasar <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a> of <a href='tags/adh-dhahabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>adh-Dhahabee</font></a> (pg. 266):     <P>

And upon this poem is written, in the handwriting of al-Allaamah Taqee ad-Deen bin Salaah, "This is the belief of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah". And likewise this phrase was used by Ahmad bin Thaabit at-Turkee, the haafidh. And Shaykh Abdul Qaadir al-Jeelee (or Jeelaanee), and the muftee Abd al-Azeez al-Qaheetee and a group (of scholars)... And what Ibn Abee Zayd and the others meant (by this) was to distinguish between His being with us and His Being above <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>.

And Ibn Abee Zayd al-Qayrawaanee (d. 386H), known as Imaam Maalik as-Sagheer, said in his risaalah:    <P>

And Abu 'Umar at-Talamankee (d. 429H) said, as occurs in Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah of Ibn al-Qayyim (p.142):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the Muslims are united, those from Ahl us-Sunnah, that the meaning of "<b>And He is with you wherever you may be</b>" (Hadeed 57:4) and what is similar to that from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is [referring] to his knowledge and that Allaah is above the heavens <u>with His Essence (bi dhaatihi)</u>, ascended over His <a href='tags/throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Throne</font></a> however He wills ...</blockquote>    <P>
And this is just a small sample to illustrate that the Ahl ul-Hadeeth indeed used explanatory phrases <b>in response</b> to what was initiated by the people of falsehood - those who are the ancestors of the likes of this Philadelphian <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Ash'ari whose words we have quoted above.    <P>
And thus we see in other subjects, in the subject of Imaan (faith) the Ahl ul-Hadeeth saying, "<i>Imaan is speech and action</i>", or "<i>Imaan is belief, speech and action</i>", or "<i>Imaan is speech, action and intention</i>" - whereas the likes of this is not found anywhere in the Book or the Sunnah, in terms of the wording - however the Ahl ul-Hadeeth clarified the precise meanings of what was in the Book and the Sunnah - in response to the Murji'ah who opposed the Book and the Sunnah and raised the controversy.    <P>
And likewise, we see the Ahl ul-Hadeeth saying in relation to the Qur'aan, "<i>The Qur'aan is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated</i>" - and we do not see the likes of this phrase anywhere in the Book or the Sunnah and they said this in response to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who were the first to raise this controversy, so Ahl ul-Hadeeth used these explantory phrases <b>in response</b> to these deviants.    <P>
So the Salaf never remained silent, they clarified and explained the meaning that is abundantly clear in the texts. All of this took place <b>before</b> <a href='tags/abu-hasan-al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hasan <a href="tags/al-ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi were even born - and continued <b>after</b> them. So the Ahl ul-Hadeeth indeed - they used words, and they added to what is in the Book and the Sunnah, <b>out of necessity</b>, explanatory phrases to distinguish and separate the truth from the falsehood.    <P>

Abdullaah Ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181H) said as reported in ar-Raddu alal-Jahmiyyah of ad-Daarimee (p.67): <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We know our Lord to be above (fawqa) His seven heavens, <u>He ascended over <a href='tags/the-throne.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/throne.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Throne</font></a></font></a>, is separate and distinct (baa'in) from His creation</u> and we do not say as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> say.</blockquote>    <P>
