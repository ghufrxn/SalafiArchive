<div class='sidebar'><blockquote> <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is upon the theology of <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>, those who adopted the conceptual tools and baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and used them to distort the Book of Allaah and deny (aspects of) the Prophetic Sunnah. This faction appeared in the early first century hijrah when al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought in the use of Aristotelian and neo-Platonic language to speak about theology. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took it from them, and then a series of sects appeared who took this same path, including the <u>Raafidee Hishaamiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u> and others. Amongst them were <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b> and amongst them were <b>Mu'attilah</b> and both (errant) ways are founded upon the same <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> which is a term that represents the philosophical baggage of the Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) who incorporated the metaphysical language and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in theological discussion and debate. Before reading this series of articles you must do some background research to be able to follow along. The recommended articles for study are <a href=index17f5.html?lxtuo>this article</a> (provides good historical background and context), <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a> (<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>), <a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>this series</a> (<b>Destroying the Allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and Tashbih Against Ahl al-Sunnah</b>) and <a href=index1d7c.html?qcsxk>Part 4</a>  and <a href=indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5</a> of a series dealing with the creation or eternity of the universe between the Mutakallimeen (Ahl al-Kalaam, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots) and the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (al-Farabi, Ibn Sina). The reader is also encouraged to study articles on this site through which it will become clear that todays Ash'aris do not follow Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah), but those later ones (<u><a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a></u>, <u>al-Qushayree</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u>, <u>al-Raazee</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a></u>) who came after him and, through their own input and influence, took <b>the early Kullaabi-Ash'ari creed</b> in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Soofiyyah, Gnostic illuminists, eventually merging <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> as was done by the later ones. The evidence for that is overwhelming and can be found in articles on this site.     <P>
<b>What is known as "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" today is not what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> died upon. Many of the smart and shrewd ones amongst todays <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (posing as Ash'aris) know this very well and hence, they describe "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" as a "<u>dynamic approach in theology</u>" and not necessarily a fixed set of doctrines (because of the presence of much conflict, contradiction and inconsistency that is inherent in the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school). This is just one example of the many frauds they perpetrate against innocent Muslims who simply want to know the creed brougth by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and believed by the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), which is in accord with the <i>fitrah</i> and which is devoid of the conceptual baggage of that heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (a cover label for "<i>philosophy</i>") which they entered into the Ummah, split the Muslims and brought trials and calamities upon them.</b>    <P>
As for <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>, an online biographical account states:    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/ibrahim-osi-efa.gif style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" align="right" border="1" border=0>Shaykh Ibrahim was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He was blessed with the opportunity to study several classical disciplines at the hands of some of the holders of the tradition such as Murabit al-Haj, al-Habib Umar b. Hafiz and Shaikh Hassan al-Hindi. Initially studying for three years in Syria and Mauritania, Ustaz Ibrahim was then blessed with the opportunity to spend over six years in the illuminated city of Tarim, Hadramaut where he studied under the qualified hands of teachers such as al-Habib Kazim al-Saqqaf, al-Habib Ali al-Jifri and al-Shaikh Umar Husain al-Khatib. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> was one of the founders of several Islamic initiatives including the Ibn Abbas Institute, Starlatch Press, Badr Language Institute and the Greensville Trust. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> currently resides in Liverpool, England with his wife and two children.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that the teachers of this man are <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, gnostic-illuminists, mystics and those calling to saint-worship - matters which <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was free and innocent of.     <P>
In this series of articles we are going to deconstruct the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> which is taught through his course entitled <b><a href='tags/micro-madrasa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Micro Madrasa</font></a></b>. Our aim in these articles is to allow the reader to see the clear difference between what the Righteous Salaf were upon and between what the Ash'aris and Maturidis inherited from <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. In the course of these articles many of the historical and academic frauds of those posing as "Ash'aris" today and the Maturidis will become clear by Allaah's permission.     <P>
Throughout this series we will refer to <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> and his theological family as <b>the Jahmiyyah</b>, since <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (and al-Ja'd bin Dirham) are the primary origin points for their theology, and the term "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" is really an umbrella term for all those factions who built their theology upon the conceptual baggage and terminology brought into the Ummah by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the first century hijrah.   </blockquote></div> <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>01. </b> From <a href=index7b25.html?moitybx>Part 1</a> and <a href=index9bff.html?dglhpiw>Part 2</a> in this series it should be clear that the conceptual baggage taken from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> by the Mutakallimeen (<a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a>) lead them to a theology characterized and defined through <a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a> (<i>jawhar, <a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>, arad, hawaadith</i>). They used this conceptual baggage for their polemics in trying to prove the universe has an originator through the argument of <i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i>. As a result, they erred in the matter of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> by making the issue of proving an originated universe (through pure reason) to be the basis of faith and the greatest foundation of the religion, despite the fact that this is a matter ingrained in the <i>fitrah</i> and was not the primary call of the Messengers. [This is alongside the fact that their alleged proof is flawed in the first place and does not prove or establish an actual "<i>act</i>" of creation took place. <i>The very nature of the argument makes that impossible</i>, otherwise it renders the very creator they are trying to prove to be a body like the rest of the created bodies.] Consequently, their discussion of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> centres only around the <u>ruboobiyyah</u> of Allaah and they are forced to speak about Allaah based largely around the same Aristotelian conceptual baggage and terminology they used to prove his existence. In turn, they also erred in the meaning of <i>ilaah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1604;&#1607;</span>), and <i>uloohiyyah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1604;&#1608;&#1607;&#1610;&#1577;</span>), reducing its meaning to "<i>one with the ability to create, invent</i>" an error <u>linguistically</u> and also <u>legislatively</u>.    <P>
<b>02. </b> Ibrahim Osi Efa states, "<i>When synonymous with the science of theology</i>..." he is referring here to <i><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></i>, when this is treated the same a "<i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>" or "<i>usool al-deen</i>" then it refers to "<i><u>a science</u> that <u>enables a person to affirm religious creed</u> on the basis of <u>absolute proofs</u></i>." There are three or four issues here (which have been underlined), <u>a)</u> a science <u>b)</u> enabling a person to affirm <u>c)</u> religious creed and <u>d)</u> absolute proofs. We will take up each of these issues.    <P>
<b>03. </b> As for the alleged <b>science</b> that Ibrahim Osi Efa is going to peddle for the rest of his course, then it is the science that was condemned by the Imaams of the Salaf from the second century onwards. It is the science founded on the conceptual baggage of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> bin Nichomachus which had been adopted by the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>) before it came to the Mutakallimeen in Islaam. It is on the basis of this conceptual baggage that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> began to deny <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions. And the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> groups which came afterwards (Raafidi <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a>, the Maturidiyyah) they took the basic foundations of this "science" but they all had different ways and approaches in trying to validate the basic elements of the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> (proving the bodies that make up the universe are originated and hence have a creator). It is here where their differences lie as to what degree they are prepared to deny <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions in order validate this proof and to what degree they are prepared to distort the Book and the Sunnah in the nameof <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i>, so that the revealed texts can be reconciled with their flawed corrupt proof. This science is known as "<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>" or "<i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>" Anyone who spoke about <a href='tags/allaahs-names.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Names</font></a>, attributes and actions on the basis of this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> was deemed a heretic by the Imaams of the Salaf including the four Imaams and their immediate followers. This is a matter of <b>unanimous agreement</b> and is narrated from the Salaf through <b>tawaatur</b> (large-scale transmission). No one denies this except an ignoramus or person of desires or an arrogant bigot and the historical record can be used to prove him as such.    <P>
<b>04. </b> <b>Im&#257;m al-Shafi&#703;&#299; (d. 204H)</b> "<i>The people did not become ignorant and nor differ (with each other) except due to their abandonment of the language of the Arabs and their inclination to the language of Aristotle</i>." Al-Suyuti in &#7778;awn al-Man&#7789;iq (1/47-48). &#703;Abd All&#257;h bin Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad narrates from Mu&#7717;ammad bin D&#257;w&#363;d who said, "<i>It is not preserved during the era of ash-Shafi&#703;&#299; that he spoke of any of the desires (innovated matters), nor was it ascribed to him, and nor was he known for it, (this is) alongside his hatred for the people of kal&#257;m and bida&#703; (innovations)</i>." Dhamm ul-Kal&#257;m wa Ahlih&#299; of Abu Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l al-Haraw&#299; (4/282). And in famous statement, al-Shafi'i said, "<i>My ruling regarding Ahl ul-Kal&#257;m is that they are to be beaten with palm-branches and shoes, carried upon camels and paraded amongst the kinsfolk, it being announced about them, 'This is the recompense of the one who abandoned the Book and the Sunnah and turned to kal&#257;m'.</i>" Siyar A&#703;l&#257;m an-Nubul&#257; of al-Dhahab&#299;, (10/29) and &#7778;awn al-Man&#7789;iq of al-Suy&#363;t&#299;, (no. 65). <b>Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad bin &#7716;anbal (d. 241H)</b> said, "<i>I am not a person of kal&#257;m, and nor do I hold [the permissibility] of kal&#257;m in anything of this [matter], except what is from the Book of All&#257;h, or is in a &#7717;ad&#299;th of All&#257;h's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), as for what is besides that, then indulging in kal&#257;m with respect to it is not praiseworthy</i>." al-A&#7779;bah&#257;n&#299; in  al-Hujjah F&#299; Bay&#257;n al-Mahajjah (1/130). And Abu Bakr al-Marwaz&#299; reports that he heard Ab&#363; &#703;Abd All&#257;h [Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad] saying, "<i>Whoever takes to kal&#257;m will  never prosper and whoever takes to kal&#257;m will not escape from tajahhum (adopting the &#363;s&#363;l of the Jahmiyyah)</i>." Ibn Ba&#7789;&#7789;&#257;h in Kit&#257;b al-Ib&#257;nah, Kit&#257;b al-&#298;m&#257;n (2/537).  With respect to <b>Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fah (d. 150H)</b>, Muhammad bin al-&#7716;asan (al-Shayb&#257;n&#299;) , the companion of Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fah said,  "<i>Ab&#363; Han&#299;fah said: 'May All&#257;h curse &#703;Amr bin &#703;Ubayd, for he opened the door to speech (kal&#257;m) regarding that which does not concern them of speech.' And Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fah used to encourage us to gain fiqh (jurisprudence) and would prohibit us from kal&#257;m'</i>." and Nu&#7717; al-J&#257;mi&#703; said: I said to Ab&#363; Han&#299;fah: What do you say about what the people have innovated of speech regarding al-a&#703;r&#257;d and al-ajs&#257;m? He said, "<i>(Nothing but) the sayings of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>.  Upon you is (to follow) the narrations and the path of the Salaf, and beware of every newly-invented matter, for it is an innovation</i>." Dhamm ul-Kal&#257;m wa Ahlih&#299; of Abu Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l al-Haraw&#299; (4/213-214) and also Dhamm al-Ta&#702;w&#299;l of Ibn Qud&#257;mah (1/32/33). <u>Ab&#363; Y&#363;suf</u>  (d. 182H) the companion  of Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fah, said, "<i>Whoever sought his religion through kal&#257;m will fall into heresy</i>." Dhamm ul-Kal&#257;m wa Ahlih&#299; of Abu Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l al-Haraw&#299; (4/210). Note that Abu Yusuf here is speaking of Ibrahim Osi Efa and whoever is unfortunate enough (through al-qadaa wal-qadar) to end up on his course. <b>Im&#257;m M&#257;lik (d.  179H)</b> said, "<i>May All&#257;h curse &#703;Amr [bin &#703;Ubayd], for he innovated these innovations of kal&#257;m. If kal&#257;m had been knowledge, the Companions and Successors would have spoken regarding it, just as they spoke about the rulings and legislative matters. However it is falsehood that directs to falsehood</i>." Sharh al-Sunnah of al-Baghaw&#299; (1/217).  And Ibn Surayj al-Sh&#257;fi&#703;&#299; (d. 306H) stated, "<i>The Tawh&#299;d of the people of knowledge and the Jam&#257;&#703;ah of the Muslims is 'I testify none is worthy of worship except All&#257;h (alone) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of All&#257;h'. And the Tawh&#299;d of the people of falsehood is disputing about al-a&#703;r&#257;d (incidental attributes) and al-ajs&#257;m (bodies) and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent with the rejection of that.</i>" Dhamm ul-Kal&#257;m of al-Harawi (4/385-386).     <P>

The Salaf did not condemn the genus of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (as in any speech) but something very specific, it was the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. This <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is <u>the very kalaam</u> that forms <u>the core foundation</u> for the theology of the Ash'aris and Maturidis. It is here that we make note of <b>three academic and intellectual frauds</b> that Ibrahim Osi Efa  will convey through his course. <u><b>The first</b></u> is their claim that many of the Imaams of the Salaf indulged in "<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>" and what they mean by this is that these Imaams simply "<i>spoke on matters of belief</i>" they treat this to be "<i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i>" but this is not the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> condemned by the Salaf, they intended something very specific. They intended the conceptual baggage of <i>al-ajsaam wal-a'raad</i>. This is what they condemned not the genus of  <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. Hence, to treat Ibn Abbaas's discussion with the Khawaarij, for example, or any other such type of discussion where truth is affirmed by citing evidence from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or Sunnah as being "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" and treating that the same as the innovated kalam derived from the language of the <a href='tags/metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Metaphysics</font></a> of a star-worshipping idolator a gross error. This is academic dishonesty. The <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> the Salaf condemned is very specific. The <u><b>second fraud</b></u> is the pretence of the Ash'aris and Maturidis that they differ with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on foundational issues when the reality of the  matter is that <u>they agree on foundational issues</u> whilst disputing only on subsidiary issues. They are united upon <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> being the basis for theology and all their books start off with the issue of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> because the Ash'aris and Maturidis took it from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to begin with. <b>They just differ on some of the finer elements of this proof they use to prove the universe is originated and the lawaazim (binding necessities) that follow on from such an argument</b>. However, the very nature of this proof is such that it forces them to deny Allaah's attributes and actions, otherwise the proof would demonstrate that Allaah too is a created body. Their differences lie in what can be affirmed for Allaah without negating the underlying proof used to establish His existence. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> negate everything, treating attributse to be <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> (incidental attributes). The As'haris, following the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, distinguished between <i><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></i> and found a way to distinguish between the attributes of Allaah (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>) and the attributes of the created beings (which they labelled as <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> because as they claim, they undergo continuous re-creation and are never permanent), so the Ash'aris, Maturidis affirm some attributes whilst negating the actions altogether. This partial negation led them to contradiction and inconsistency. The rest of their theology is then centred around inventing new principles and explanations to patch up the contradictions and inconstencies.  Hence, the "<i>kalam nafsee</i>" doctrine and "<i>Allaah will be seen but not in a direction</i>" doctrine, and the false principle of <i>al-fi'l huw al-maf'ul</i> and likewise the principle of <i>al-takween</i> of the Maturidis and so on.     <P>
<b>06. </b> The <b>third fraud</b> requires a separate treatment because of its crucial importance in having <u>a birds-eye view</u> of how these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> operate out there in the field. This is understood by the following: It is known and accepted by all factions that just because a person ascribes to the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) it does not mean he is a follower of him in all matters, rather, he can be an opposer, a strayer, a disputant in many affairs. We see the <u>Qaraamitah</u>, <u>Baatiniyyah</u>, <u><a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a></u> ascribe to the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) when he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is free and innocent of them. And likewise, the various sects, from the <u>Khawarij</u>, <u>Qadariyyah</u>, <u>Murji'ah</u>, <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u> and others. They also ascribe to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and atribute to the deen he brought many matters that are not from it at all. <b>So when this is the case</b>, and when this is a matter accepted by all factions and parties, <u>then it is not difficult</u> to also accept that those who ascribe to the four Imaams (Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad), then many of the later ones who affiliated themselves to them (Hanafis, Malikiees, Shafi'is, Hanbalis), they opposed the way of those Imaams and ascribed to those Imaams what they were free and innocent of. Hence, the Maturidis tried to ascribe their kalam theology to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, and the Ash'aris ascribe to al-Shafi'i what he is free of and some of the later <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> (such as <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a> and the al-Timimi family of the fifth century and Ibn Aqeel and Ibn al-Jawzee), they also tried to ascribe things to <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> he was free of, and likewise with the Malikis. <b>The closest and earliest associates and followers of these Imaams were free of <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and its people</b>. But many of the later ones entered into it and were affected by it and some of them tried to ascribe it to the Imaams, and some of them tried to qualify and characterize the creed of those Imaams through this <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> language. In reality, not a single Imaam delved into this <i><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></i> of <i>al-ajsaam and al-a'raad</i> and whoever claims so is a liar and fabricator against them. This brings us to our point which is that from the academic fraud of these contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> is that when they wish to justify their heretical kalam theology, they will draw upon some of the writings and statements of those later ones who came and were affected by something of this <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> or its associated language or its binding approach of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> or <i>tafweed</i>. Hence, the appeal to <u><a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a></u> (he was affected by <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> and Abu Mansur al-Bagdhadi though his attachment to al-Ash'aris book <i>al-Ibaanah</i> saved him from from denying the <i>sifaat khabariyyah</i>), and also the appeal to <u><a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a></u> (who was affected by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, having studied with some of them), and likewise to <u>Ibn Aqeel</u> (affected by the Mu'tazilah) and <u>Ibn al-Jawzee</u> (outcast by the rest of the <a href='tags/hanbalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanbalis</font></a> of his time due to his deviation in the Sifaat), and then later scholars such as <u><a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a></u> and <u>Ibn Hajar</u>, who though they never delved fundamentally into the core of <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i>, they were affected by its conclusions and associated language and fell into something of <i>ta'wee</i>l or <i>tafweed</i> that was necessitated by it. The reader will find the following articles useful for further elaboration on this matter, "<b>The Levels and Ranks of Ash'arism or Those To Whom It is Ascribed</b>"  (<a href=index2046.html?cmwje>see here</a>) and the appropriate section in "<b>Destroying the Slander of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> (<a href='tags/anthropomorphism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anthropomorphism</font></a>) Against Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah: Part 1</b>" (<a href=index01b6.html?wlodz>see here</a>) that makes mention of <a href='tags/abu-yalaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Ya'laa</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-qurtubi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qurtubi</font></a> and Ibn Hajar.    <P>
<b>07. </b> Undeniable proof that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Ash'aris can be seen in <a href=index27ca.html?mrgly>this article</a> (<b>Aristotelians Anonymous: Admitting Your Creed Is Built Around Aristotle's Maqoolaat Is the First Step to Recovery</b>) which documents only a fraction of the evidence. The Ash&#703;arites inherited this proof from the Mu&#703;tazilah  and it was used as the foundation for the madhhab  starting with al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; (d. 324H) in <i>al-Luma&#703; Fi al-Radd &#703;al&#257; Ahl al-Zaygh</i>, then al-B&#257;qill&#257;n&#299; (d. 403H), in <i>al-Tamh&#299;d al-Aw&#257;'il</i>,  then &#703;Abd al-Qahir al-Baghd&#257;d&#299; (d. 429H) in <i>Kit&#257;b U&#7779;&#363;l al-D&#299;n</i>, then al-Isfar&#257;y&#299;n&#299; (d. 471H) in <i>al-Tab&#7779;&#299;r Fil-D&#299;n</i>, then al-Juwayn&#299; (d. 478H) in <i>Kit&#257;b al-Irsh&#257;d</i> and also <i>al-Sh&#257;mil F&#299; U&#7779;&#363;l al-Din</i>, then al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (d. 505H) in <i>al-Iqtis&#257;d F&#299; al-I&#703;tiq&#257;d</i>, and also <i>Tah&#257;fut al-Fal&#257;sifah</i>, then al-Shahrast&#257;n&#299; (d. 548H) in <i>Nih&#257;yah al-Aqd&#257;m</i>, then al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. 606H) in <i>Mu&#7717;a&#7779;&#7779;al Afk&#257;r al-Mutaqaddim&#299;n wal-Muta'akhkhir&#299;n</i> and also <i>Kit&#257;b al-Arba&#703;&#299;n F&#299; U&#7779;&#363;l al-D&#299;n</i>, then al-&#298;j&#299; (d. 756H) in <i>al-Maw&#257;qif F&#299; &#703;Ilm al-Kal&#257;m</i>. This is undeniable proof also that the condemnation of the Salaf in the second and third centuries against the <u>Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Kullaabiyyah</u> extends to the <u>Ash'aris and Maturidis</u>, since their theology is an extension of the theology of those earlier groups. Their foundations are undeniably the same. These historical facts are often deliberately concealed by <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and Maturidi teachers and instructors who misguide the common-folk upon knowledge and on account of bigoted partisanship. So everything which has preceded relates to the "<b>science</b>" that Ibrahim Osi Efa is speaking of, it is a corrupt science taken from the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, originating in the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> bin Nicomachus (<a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>see this series</a>) and that is why you will see their language gravitating towards an Aristotelian deity, expressed through the language of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a>, and also why you will be shocked to learn that though the Mutakallimeen fought against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> on matters such as the origination and eternity of the universe, they actually concurred and agreed about the description of the "first cause" or "deity" they affirmed Just compare between <a href='tags/ibn-sina.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Sina</font></a> (<a href=indexc0cf.html?mrsit>see here</a>) and <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (<a href=indexa348.html?ykoxo>see here</a>), for example.    <P>
<b>08. </b> As for Ibrahim Osi Efa's statements "<b>that enables a person to affirm</b>..." then the reality of this matter is that when a person takes their arguments through to their full logical conclusions and applies sound reason to them, their science does not actually affirm <u>a created universe</u>, <u>nor a prophet sent</u> and <u>nor a resurrection</u>. This is why they got tangled in centuries of debate with the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> because the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> saw the clear flaws in the proof (of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i>) they were using through which it is impossible to prove that an actual "<u>act</u>" of creation took place. <b>The very nature of this proof makes this impossible</b>. This then gave the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> a chance to prove that their view (of matter being eternal and necessitated by Allaah's essence, if it exists, matter exists) is true and correct through the argument that the proof of the Mutakallimeen is flawed. But this is a false argument from the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, just because the Mutakallimeen are using a flawed corrupt proof, does not mean that the view of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> is correct. It is here that many of the leading figureheads of the Ash'aris got utterly confused, often passing through numerous (contradictory) stages in their lives, and finally expressing utter bewilderment when they reached the end of their lives as is related from <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>. In the 8th century hijrah, <b>Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</b> came and wrote extensively on these matters, and gave a helping hand to the Mutakallimeen against the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a>, whilst also refuting much of the falsehood useed by the Mutakallimeen that got them in trouble in the first place. So the point here is that they Mutakallimeen in their alleged rational arguments have not provided satisfactory evidence for the universe beign originated, nor for establishing the prophethood of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and nor for the resurrection. And these three matters are raised further in this course and we will address them at the relevant point.     <P>
<b>09. </b> Then Ibrahim Osi Efa says, "... <b>to affirm religious creed</b>..." this is referring to Allaah's existence, His oneness, the Messengership of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Resurrection. The <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> indulged in argumentation in these three areas, deviating from simpler, more profound methods in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and resorting to blameworthy <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>. To prove Allaah's existence they used the proof of <i>huduth al-ajsaam</i> which does not prove any "<u>act of creation</u>" took place to explain the matter and bodies making up the universe. They spoke about the Prophethood of Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) limiting the proof to the issue of miracles without satisfactorily distinguishing the signs and evidences of the Prophets from what is done by magicians and swindlers. They spoke about resurrection based upon the <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> they took from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and opposed <i>hiss</i> (sensory perception) and <i>aql</i> (reason) and did not actually prove any resurrection. It is for this reason that Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> remarked, "<i>And likewise the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of those who preceded him (<a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>), from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their followers from the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and others, from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, for you will not find in their <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> which they innovated, not the affirmation of ruboobiyyah, nor prophethood and nor the resurrection</i>" (al-Nubuwwaat 2/629). These matters will be addressed at the relevant parts in this series inshaa'Allaah. The point here is that the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of the Mutakallimeen leads to doubt, uncertainty, bewilderment and confusion.     <P>
<b>10. </b> Then Ibrahim Osi Efa says, "... <b>on the basis of absolute proofs</b>" and they do not have any "<i>absolute proofs</i>" what they have are flawed, corrupt, long-winded arguments, often based upon incorrect premises, that do not achieve the desired objective. These "<i>absolute proofs</i>" they claim will be analyzed at the appropriate place.    <P>
<b>11. </b> In summary, what Ibrahim Osi Efa is drawing you into is what the Salaf unanimously condemned in the 2nd and 3rd centuries hijrah, it is <u>the conceptual baggage</u> of <b><a href='tags/aristotelian-metaphysics.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotelian <a href="tags/metaphysics.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Metaphysics</font></a></font></a></b> that came through the <u>Hellenized Jews, Christians and Sabeans</u> to the "<b>Kalam Dynasty</b>" in this Ummah, the <u>Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Rafidee Mujassimah</u> in the 2nd century, and the <u>Kullaabiyyah and <a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a> Mujassimah</u> in the 3rd century and the <u>Ash'ariyyah, <a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a> and Maturidiyyah</u> in the 4th century. It is <i>pseudo-intellectualism</i> and <i>pseudo-rationalism</i> that become apparent when you analyze the corrupt arguments they bring. The absurdity of it all is rounded up when you still see them clinging to a particular outdated notion of <a href='tags/atomism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Atomism</font></a> outlined in their books which is falsified by contemporary knowledge - a matter we shall take up at the appropriate place inshaa'Allaah.     <P>
