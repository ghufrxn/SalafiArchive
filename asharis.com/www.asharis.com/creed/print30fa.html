<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanation of the Six Stages in the Evolution of the Doctrines of the <a href='tags/quran-creationists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an Creationists</font></a> Diagram </font>    <P>
All praise is due to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may prayers and salutations be upon His Messenger, to proceed:    <P>
This is a diagram that shows <u>the flow</u> of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> usool (foundations) on the subject of Allaah's Speech and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>  through the factions of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> (Jahmiyyah, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>,  <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah), as well as the evolution of their variant sayings - all of which have the same root and foundation. All of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> are "<u>going with the flow</u>", but differing with each other on subsidiary issues. The "<u>flow</u>" is to keep in conformity, in their sayings and formulated doctrines, with <u>the Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-Arad</u> that is based upon the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" which the bulk of their creed is based upon. This Tawheed of theirs is essentially to deny for Allaah <u>attributes (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sifaat</font></a>)</u>, and those matters affirmed for Allaah in the revealed texts that they consider to be <u>incidental attributes (<a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a>)</u>, <u>events, occurrences (hawaadith)</u> - (<i>alongside the differences between the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> in this regard as to what can and cannot be affirmed or negated from Allaah</i>) - all of this so as to not to render Him a body (ajsaam). <u>And this is the limit of their Tawheed</u> and it is not the Tawheed of the Messengers, the people of knowledge or the Jamaa'ah of the Muslims.    <P>
Ibn Suraij as-Shafi'ee (d. 306H) said, as narrated from him by Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in "Dhamm ul-Kalaam" and as mentioned by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<a href="tags/bayaan-talbees-al-jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bayaan Talbees al-<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font></a>":    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'> &#1578;&#1608;&#1581;&#1610;&#1583; &#1575;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605; &#1608;&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1606; &#1571;&#1588;&#1607;&#1583; &#1571;&#1606; &#1604;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583;&#1575; &#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1578;&#1608;&#1581;&#1610;&#1583; &#1575;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1575;&#1591;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1608;&#1590; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1593;&#1585;&#1575;&#1590; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1580;&#1587;&#1575;&#1605; &#1608;&#1575;&#1606;&#1605;&#1575; &#1576;&#1593;&#1579; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610; &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; &#1576;&#1575;&#1606;&#1603;&#1575;&#1585; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Tawheed of the people of knowledge and the jamaa'ah of the Muslims is "<i>I testify none is worthy of worship except Allaah (alone) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah</i>". And the Tawheed of the people of falsehood is disputing about al-a'raad (incidental attributes) and al-ajsaam (bodies) and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was sent with the rejection of that.</blockquote>    <P>
So their Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad is not what the Books were revealed with and nor what the Messengers were sent with.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nu-1.gif align=left border=0><font class='titleHeadline'><u>ONE:</u> The Saying of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> That Allaah Does Not Have Speech</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> negated all attributes for Allaah, since to them affirmation of a description of any kind would have rendered Allaah a body (<a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a>), and it would oppose and invalidate the proof that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were using of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>" (the presence of qualities in bodies proving they are brought about, created) against the atheists they were debating with.    <P>
So they denied all attributes amongst which is "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" speech. And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> did not deny that speech "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is correctly defined as both meaning (ma'naa) and word (lafdh) and that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is with voice and is heard, this was never disputed by any faction amongst the various factions until <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) appeared. The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> simply said, "<i>Allaah does not have speech</i>" and as for the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> then it is something that Allaah created, just like other created things. And so the Salaf refuted them through the textual evidences that are abundant in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and likewise in the Sunnah such as his (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) saying, "<b>There is not one of you except that His Lord will speak to Him, without there being any translator between him and Him</b>." (Bukhari and Muslim).    <P>
So to these people, the Salaf said that Allaah does speak and that:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah.</b></blockquote>    <P>
Affirming that Allaah has the attribute of speech, and what is said below regarding the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> was also said to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> as they were both agreed that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nu-2.gif align=left border=0><font class='titleHeadline'><u>TWO:</u> The Saying of the <a href="tags/mutazilah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mu'tazilah</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, going with the flow, also debating the atheists and holding onto the proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"  - with their own additions and refinements to it - said that Allaah does have speech, but it is something Allaah creates outside of Himself, and Allaah can be said to have "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" even though He creates it and it is established in other than Himself, such as Jibreel or the tree. And this is just like it can be said, "the House of Allaah", "the She-Camel of Allaah", "the Mosques of Allaah" and so on. So they agreed with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created, although they said it can be considered the "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" of Allaah from the angle mentioned. With this saying, they avoided invalidating their Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad, and they managed to affirm "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" for Allaah as something created, separate from Him whilst maintaining their credo of "<i>Allaah is not a jism</i>" (i.e. cannot have sifat, <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> or hawaadith) - whereas the creed of the Muslims is "<i>There is none worthy of worship except Allaah alone</i>" as has preceded from Ibn Suraij ash-Shaafi'ee.    <P>
To both the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the Salaf said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated.</b></blockquote>    <P>
And this became the saying of all of the Muslims, at the head of them, the Imaams of the Salaf, and they declared a kafir, anyone who said otherwise. Al-Laalikaa'ee reports in his "Sharh Usool I'tiqaad Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah", (2/275-277):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>From Ahmad bin Abdillaah bin al-Khidr al-Muqree - [chain of narration] - that Abu Muhammad Yahyaa bin Khalf al-Muqree said:     <P>
<blockquote>I was with Maalik bin Anas in the year 168 H. and a man came to him and said: "O Abu Abdullaah what do you say about the one who says: The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created?" He said: "<u>A kaafir, heretic (zindeeq), kill him</u>". The man then said: "I am just quoting these words which I heard". Then he (Maalik) said: "I have not heard them from anyone else, I have heard them from you".     <P>
Abu Muhammad said: Then that was a bit tough on me so I went to Misr and I met al-Layth bin Sa'd and said: "O Abu al-Haarith, what do you say about the one who says: The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created?" And then I narrated to him the words said to Maalik, and then he said: "<u>[Such a one is] a kaafir</u>". Then I met Ibn Luhay'ah and I said to him the equivalent of what I said to al-Layth bin Sa'd and I narrated to him the words. He said: "<u>A kaafir</u>."</blockquote>    <P>
And in another narration from 'Abbaas al-Azhar there continues:     <P>
<blockquote>And then I came to Makkah and met Sufyaan bin 'Uyainah and narrated to him the words of the man (who came to Maalik bin Anas) and he said: "<u>A kaafir</u>". Then I went to Koofah and I met Abu Bakr bin Ayyaash and I said to him: "What do you say about the one who says the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created?" And I narrated to him the words of the man. He said: "<u>He is a kaafir and whoever does not say he is a disbeliver is himself a kaafir</u>". Then I met Alee bin Aasim and Hushaym and I said the same to them both and narrated to them the words of the man and they both said: "<u>A kaafir</u>". Then I met Abdullaah bin Idrees, Abu Usaamah, Ubdah bin Sulaimaan al-Kallaabee, Yahyaa bin Zakariyyaa and Wakee' and I narrated to them and they said: "<u>A kaafir</u>". Then I met Ibn al-Mubaarak, Abu Ishaaq al-Fazaaree and al-Waleed bin Muslim, so I narrated to them the words and they said, all of them: "<u>A kaafir</u>."</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
And this was the situation in the last quarter of the second century hijrah. But the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> gained strength politically and managed to influence certain leaders on this issue, and it was here that they put the Ummah to trial with their innovation.     <P>
The Salaf continued to stand against their innovation, refuting it by pen and word, many of them being killed, and their opposition culminated in the fitnah (tribulation) of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (d. 241H) and through <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> did Allaah aid the deen against the Nasty <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Heretics.     <P>
The entire dispute at this point was regarding this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> we have present with us, in letter and word, for there was no Muslim that believed in "two Qur'ans", or that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was a "quotation" or "expression" of another unrevealed <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and it was agreed upon by all factions up to this point that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is both meaning (ma'naa) and word (lafdh) together, and it is with voice, and is something heard - this being manifest and evident in the revealed texts.    <P>
When the Imaams of the Salaf had stated that "The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah, uncreated", a new faction emerged who would only say "the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah" and then remain silent. They were labelled as the "<b>Waaqifah</b>", those who pause and do not clarify. They were declared as misguided and astray and were considered a faction of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, since there was absolutely no reason or excuse for choosing to remain ambiguous after thousands of the leading Imaams of the Salaf had agreed upon the statement that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah, uncreated.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nu-3.gif align=left border=0><font class='titleHeadline'><u>THREE:</u> The Saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href="tags/lafdhiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Lafdhiyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
When these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were subdued and humiliated, due to the stance of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> through Allaah's aid and support, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> were in hiding and did not dare to utter their kufr so brazenly and openly any more. From here, we'll let <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387, rahimahullaah, take over. <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H) said regarding the emergence of what would later became the view of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> from its Jahmee roots, in his "Ibaanat ul-Kubraa" in the book "ar-Radd 'alal-Jahmiyyah" (1/317-318):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibn-battah-quran-created-lafdhiyyah.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: Mention of the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> and Warning From their Opinion and Their Sayings</b>    <P>
Know, may Allaah have mercy upon you that a faction amongst the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, out of the conniving of their hearts, and the vileness of their opinions and the repugnance of their desires believed that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And they alluded to that with an innovation they invented out of deception and misleading of the common folk, [all] in order to conceal their kufr, seeking to obscure their deviation from the one whose knowledge was little and whose disposition was weak. So they said:     <P>
<blockquote>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah spoke with and said, that is the speech of Allaah, not created, and as for that which we recite and read with our tongues and which we write in our copies [of the Qur'an] is not the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is the <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> of Allaah. This is only a hikaayah (quotation, narrative) of that. <u>So what we read is a hikaayah (quotation, narrative) of that <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with our own words (alfaadh), and our verbal expression (with our words) is created</u>.</blockquote>    <P>
So they became subtle in their kufr and they used deceitful means in order to enter kufr upon the common folk with the most obscure way, and the most minute [in detail] of madhhab, and the most hidden aspect.    <P>
But that was not hidden, by the praise of Allaah, and from Him, and the goodness of his tawfeeq (granting of success) upon the great Scholars, the intelligent critics, until they [the Scholars] rejected as false what they [the Jahmites] fabricated and they unveiled the cover from the repugnance of what they concealed.    <P>
So their kufr and deviance became apparent to both the distinguished and the common folk. And the one who who was wise to that and knew where the repugnance lay in  [the saying of the Jahmites] was the Shaykh, the Saalih (righteous), and the Imaam, the Scholar, the intelligent one, Abu Abdullaah Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal - may Allaah have mercy upon him. And the clarification of their kufr was manifest and clear in the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).</blockquote>    <P>
And the Scholars at the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (d. 241H) and after his death were wise to these conniving <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who wished to conceal their innovation in a time when the affair had become difficult upon them. Thus we see Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee (d. 258H), and he is the Shaykh of <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> and Muslim, outing these <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> Zindeeqs from their secret hiding places.     <P>
In "<i>Iktisaas ul-Quran bi Awdihi Ilaa ar-Raheem ar-Rahmaan</i>" of Diyaa ud-Deen al-Maqdisi (d. 634H) - a book bringing together the ahaadeeth and narrations pertaining to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being erased from this Earth and returning to Allaah, he brings - with an authentic (saheeh) chain of narration - the statement of Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/diyaa-maqdisi-ikhtisaas-ul-quraan-no-16.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><u>Whoever claims that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is two things, or that the Qur'aan is a hikaayah (quotation), then he is, by Allaah, besides whom there is none worthy of worship, a zindeeq (heretic), kaafir (disbeliever) in Allaah</u>.  This <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the [very] <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah revealed upon the tongue of Jibreel, upon Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). It it is not changed or altered. "<b>Falsehood cannot reach it from in front nor from behind, it is a revelation (tanzeel) [sent down] from the all-Wise, all-Praiseworthy</b>" [41:42], as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said: "<b>Say: If [the whole of ] mankind and the jinn gathered together to bring a like of this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they would not be able to bring a like of it, even if they were helpers to one another</b>." (al-Israa 17:88)    <P>
And if a man swore an oath that he will not speak today, then he recited the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or prayed, reciting the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (therein), or made salutation in the prayer, he would not have broken his oath. Nothing is to be analogised with the Speech of Allaah. The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, it began with Him (i.e. He spoke it), and to Him will it return. Nothing from Allaah is created, neither and nor are His Attributes, nor His Names, nor His Knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
This species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> was the root of the emergence of the Kullaabi-Ash'ari doctrines on the issue of Allaah's <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
It was during this time that both <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> and Imaam Bukhaaree subdued this tribulation and arrived at the truth in the matter, making it the followed, beaten track of Ahl us-Sunnah.    <P>
So <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> said, as is famous and well-documented from him:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever says '<i>My pronuncation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created</i>' is a Jahmee and whoever says '<i>My proncunciation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not created</i>' is an Innovator.</blockquote>    <P>
This because the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were using the fact that the actions of the servants are no doubt created, meaning that when a servant recites the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, his act of reciting, his voice is no doubt created. So as this was an accepted matter, they concealed their kufr behind this statement to use it as a means to invite others to their kufr, without alerting anyone to what they were really up to. So <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> was wise to these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and declared anyone who said this to be a Jahmee. At the same time, he also closed the other door and prevented people from saying that their recitation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was not created, as this saying was too an innovation that might lead people to believe their voices and their actions are uncreated.     <P>
And Imaam <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a>, he wrote the book "Khalq Af'aal il-Ibaad" to establish that the actions of the servants when they recite the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> are created. And he clarified this because some people had wrongly believed that the actual voices of the servants are not created or that when they hear a recitation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, they are hearing Allaah's speech directly and other such innovated repugnant sayings. So he wrote on this subject affirming that the actions of the servants are created, whilst distinguishing between the act (qiraa'ah, tilaawah) and the actual words being recited (maqroo', matluww), whilst noting that the words qiraa'ah and tilaawah can signify both the act of recitation, or the contents of recitation, and so you will see statements of others from the Salaf who prohibit the distinction between "maqroo', matluww" and "qiraa'ah, tilaawah", upon the understanding that "qiraa'ah, tilaawah" refers to the content of these acts (i.e. that being recited). But the intent of all of them was the same nevertheless, and they were all wise to the deception and trickery of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a>, the precursors to the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> on this issue.    <P>
So the truth became established and it was the saying of the Salaf:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>That which is malfoodh, maqroo', maktoob (the words being recited, pronounced, or conveyed through the voice or writing) is uncreated and the talaffudh, qiraa'ah, kitaabah (acts of pronunciation, reciting, writing) are all created.</b></blockquote>    <P>
Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) was also wise to the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> who were discontent with the truth that had been manifest and they were simply wallowing around in the pits of the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a>, discontent with the truth that had become manifest, and for this reason <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> used to scorn and speak ill of the Kullaabites, for they were Ahl ul-Kalaam and had an interest in not letting this issue die, and this matter is explained in what follows.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nu-4.gif align=left border=0><font class='titleHeadline'><u>FOUR:</u> The Saying of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> of the Doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>"</font>    <P>
There are three stages with the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> a) The innovation of the doctrine of <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> b) their rejection that Allaah speaks with letter and voice and c) their rejection that Allaah speaks when and however He wills. These doctrines emanated through the failed attempt of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> to tread a middle ground between Ahl us-Sunnah and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - they ended up agreeing with the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality, whilst feigning to agree with Ahl us-Sunnah through mere play with words, phrases and definitions.    <P>
The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> submitted to the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word, recited, heard, memorized and written is created. This was due to their ignorance and incomplete knowledge of the usool of the religion and also because <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> were also Ahl ul-Kalaam, and were upon that same flawed, false, corrupt intellectual  proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>", demonstrating the createdness of the universe through the presence of <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> (incidental attributes) and hawaadith (events, occurrences) in bodies. However, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> was the first of the <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> to affirm the attributes of the essence (sifaat dhaatiyyah). And he became known as the "Imaam of the Sifaatiyyah", and you will see that the early <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> really praise <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> a lot in their books and treat him as "amongst their associates" as <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a> (d. 478H) writes in "al-Irshaad", and <a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a> (d. 406H) refers to him as "Imaam" on many occasions. What distinguished the Kullaabi creed was their rejection of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> - meaning the actions of Allaah that are tied to His will and power, and this is the middle ground they took between Ahl us-Sunnah and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
The <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> had a problem on account of the particular doctrine they settled upon regarding Allaah's Attributes (one that the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> plagiarized and upon which the creed of the "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" was built).     <P>
The problem was <u>how can the attribute of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" be affirmed for Allaah without at the same time invalidating that (flawed, corrupt) proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>"</u> which they had wrongly submitted was a truth that could not be challenged or disputed, and through which they submitted to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that Allaah could not be described with what amounted to hawaadith (events, occurrences) - meaning, actions tied to His will and power. It was here that the "<u><a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a></u>" doctrine was born and innovated and it derived directly from the saying of some of those conniving, scheming <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> mentioned earlier by Ahmad bin Sinaan al-Waasitee (d. 258H) and as documented by <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a> (d. 387H).    <P>
Whereas it was known that the definition of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs <u>is both meaning (ma'naa) and wording (lafdh) combined</u>, <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> found a way to affirm <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> but negate from it any notion of multiplicity (multiple specific instances of kalaam) tied to will and choice (speaking as and when one wils). Now that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is <u>only the meaning present in the self</u>, and not the actual speech that is stated and heard and which one speaks as and one when one wills (this being a sign of perfection), the problem is solved. We've just affirmed "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" and at the same time kept in conformity with our rational proof by not affirming "<a href="tags/araad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">a'raad</font></a>" and "hawaadith" for Allaah. So we're happy, the atheists are forced to be happy because now they can't criticize us for contradicting the proof we used against them to prove a creator, and we just have to watch our backs now against the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> whom we are pretending to oppose. So to iron out any other problems, and to prevent the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> from attacking us, we're also going to claim that this "kalaam  nafsee" is just a singular, indivisible meaning, there is just one meaning, not two, three, or seventy million, and that this meaning is indivisible, thus multiplicity is negated, and thus we've also silenced those nasty Mu'azilah, and thus, just by playing and fooling with definitions and hoodwinking the people through these terms and definitions, we've become the champions of Islaam!    <P>
So they started bending over backwards to pretend to be in agreement with Ahl us-Sunnah, covering their backs, whilst hiding their agreement with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> - though the truth can be found, readily admitted, in some of their books.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> <b>The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> Are United That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> We Have With Us is Created - There Real Difference is Only About Definitions</b>    <P>
The view of the Ash'aris and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is EXACTLY the same with the only difference being that what the Ash'aris call "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" is what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> call knowledge and will (ilm, iraadah).

To argue for their doctrine, they could find nothing in the heritage of poetry that defined the meanings and usages of words except a line of poetry of dubious origin from a Trinitarian Christian called al-Akhtal. Further, they used verses from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that referred to speech with taqyeed (restriction), and likewise from the Sunnah, in order to claim that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is just the meaning in the self. These proofs they used all make reference to "speech" in a restricted sense, like when a person says, "I said to myself..." meaning thinking inside myself, however these types of statements are all examples restricted (muqayyad) usage. As for when "speech" (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) is used unrestrictedly, it means nothing but letter, word and voice. This is the bulk of what the deen of the Ash'arite heretics is built upon, playing with definitions and innovating new ones which they use to conceal and protect their doctrines which are those of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality, and using these definitions to make it look as if they in agreement with Ahl us-Sunnah. Thus, now they can say, "Hey! We affirm the attribute of kalaam! Don't lie upon us", whereas in reality they affirm  no such thing. They affirm an innovated attribute that Allaah did not affirm for Himself (kalaam  nafsee) and negated from Him the actual attribute that He did affirm for Himself (kalaam, as properly understood in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs).    <P>
When these heretics abandoned sanity and threw it into the wells, ditches and oceans to come out with this nonsense, the Salaf stood against them and refuted their falsehood, and so they said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated. He spoke it in reality.</b></blockquote>    <P>
And this was to affirm that "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is not just the meaning in the self without actual speech that is heard, as that would make Allaah no different to the dumb and mute, and Allaah in  many verses in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qu'ran</font></a> argues against the Mushrikeen in their worship of things that are not able to speak, or return any speech, such as in the story of Ibrahim smashing the idols, or the calf worshipped by Banee Israa'eel.    <P>

Thus, Allaah established that speech is from the characteristics of Ilaahiyyah, alongside causing benefit and harm, and He falsified the claim of as-Saamiree of Ilaahiyyah for the calf. With this and many other proofs the Salaf rendered the sayings of the Kullaabites as utter falsehood.    <P>

This was the innovation of <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (and he was followed in that by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari), so his doctrine became <u>more evil</u> than that of the <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> who at least stated that <u>there is a <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that Allaah did speak that is uncreated, but it is not this one we have with us</u>. Whereas the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> said the uncreated <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is only a meaning (ma'naa) present with Allaah's Self, and Allaah never "spoke" any <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in reality (upon the proper meaning of "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>"), and that which we have with us is  just a "quotation" or "expression" of that meaning present with Allaah's Self from eternity.    <P>
Ahl us-Sunnah stood to refute these Kullaabites and <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> whose saying was in reality worse than the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a> that appeared after the tribulation of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a> (rahimahullaah), and they stood to established that Allaah speaks with a voice, unlike the voices of the creation.    <P>
The evidences that Allaah speaks with a voice that is heard are numerous and abundant in the Book and the Sunnah, and perhaps a separate article can be dedicated to it. However briefly, Allaah in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> affirms for Himself "<b>qawl</b>" and "<b><a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a></b>" and "<b>munaadaah</b>" and "<b>munaajaah</b>" and "<b>hadeeth</b>", and He ordered Moses to "<u>istami'</u>" (listen) to what was to be revealed to him (Taha 20:13), and this collectively cannot be dismissed as being just "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" (inward silent speech) as is claimed by the Heretical Innovators. Then there are many proofs in the Sunnah likewise, and <a href='tags/al-bukhaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bukhaaree</font></a> has brought some ahaadeeth in what has been quoted from him further below. Further, it was the ijmaa of the Salaf, and there was no dispute concerning this until <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> (d. 240H) came along and innovated this "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" doctrine that was later taken up by the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>.    <P>

Finally, we can close this section with a little gift. Shaykh Abdul-Qadir al-Jeelaanee (rahimahullaah) said in Ghunyat it-Taalibeen (Dar ul-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1997CE, 1/131) regarding this issue, after mentioning many proofs for Allaah having a voice:    <P>

For Allaah, the Sublime, has never ceased to be mutakallim (one who speaks), and His Speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) comprises all of the meanings of command (amr), prohibition (nahy) and al-istikhbaar (inquiry).</blockquote>    <P>
And this is a statement of truth from the pen of a wali from the awliyaa of Allaah - Allaah speaks with a voice that is unlike the voices of the creation and tabdee' and tadleel of the Ash'arites! And is it possible for one to be considered a wali from the awliyaa of Allaah, and at the same time be possible for him to utter what is in the view of the Ash'arite <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/lafdhiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lafdhiyyah</font></a>, plain manifest kufr?!    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nu-6.gif align=left border=0><font class='titleHeadline'><u>SIX:</u> The Saying of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> That Allaah Spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Just Once In Eternity</font>    <P>
This saying of theirs is again based around their doctrine of "<a href="tags/kalaam-nafsee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam Nafsee</font></a>" which was innovated to avoid ascribing what the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> deem as "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) to Allaah. And so they rejected that Allaah speaks <u>as and when he wills</u>. Therefore their saying was that Allaah's "<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a>" is a singular, indivisible meaning, that is present with Allaah from eternity, and his speaking of that <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> is understood in the sense that it is present with His Self from eternity and as such it is "spoken only once", or "it is continuously being spoken", from the angle that it is only a single meaning established with His Self from eternity, that does not divide, renew or reecur. In other words it is only ever spoken with once, with that one instance of speaking (of that singular indivisible meaning) being spoken for eternity (without this being tied to Allaah's will) - this is generally what their saying reduces to.    <P>
The reason for this doctrine of theirs was that since the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> were debating with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> held that affirming what they call <u><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></u> (incidental attributes) and <u>hawaadith</u> (events) cannot be reconciled with the intellectual prooof of <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a> for demonstrating the universe is created that all factions were agreed upon, then they had to be rejected. And what the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> meant by <u><a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a></u>, were not just attributes which are temporarily in a thing, such as a headache in a person, but they meant attributes such as hearing, seeing, knowing and so on. And by <u>hawaadith</u> they did not just mean events that occur in a place, but they meant the actions being performed <u>by a living entity</u> out of its <u>choice and will</u>.     <P>
So the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> did not agree with them on the <a href='tags/araad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>a'raad</font></a> and found a way to <u>rationally justify</u> the affirmation of the attributes of hearing, seeing, life, knowledge, will, power, speech without at the same time invalidating the intellectual proof of "<a href="tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">hudooth ul-ajsaam</font></a>". However, they were unable to rebut the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on the other issue and so they submitted to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> regarding the issue of "hawaadith" (events) and believing that Allaah having actions tied to His will and power, could not be reconciled with their intellectual proof, they rejected that Allaah speaks as and when He wills, and the <a href='tags/kalaam-nafsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam Nafsee</font></a> doctrine was devised with this in mind.    <P>
So the Salaf responded to these people, who were <a href='tags/ibn-kullaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullaab</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee, Abu al-Abbaas al-Qalaanisee, Ibn Mahdee at-Tabaree, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-asharee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ash'aree</font></a> and they said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated. He spoke it in reality, with letter and voice. He speaks with whatever He wills and whenever He wills</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
And the proof that Allaah speaks with what He wills whenever He wills is manifest and clear in the revealed texts, it is not possible to oppose or reject it with the type tahreef and <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a> that these <a href='tags/mutakallimoon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutakallimoon</font></a> try to get away with. And and to see proofs of that, <a href=index5bb7.html?ramab>refer to this article in particular</a> which documents some of those proofs just from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.    <P>
However, the doctrine of negating "hawaadith" from Allaah is what the deen of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> was built upon and it is the deen of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, having taken it from the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, and this creed also affected  many of the scholars associated with the four schools of jurisprudence (Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is Hanbalis) and from the Hanbalis the likes of Abu Ya'laa and Ibn az-Zaaghuni were affected by this Kullaabi doctrine.    <P>
