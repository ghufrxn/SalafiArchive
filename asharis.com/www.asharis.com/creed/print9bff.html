<div class='sidebar'><blockquote> <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> is upon the theology of <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>, those who adopted the conceptual tools and baggage of the Hellenized Jews, Christians and <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a> and used them to distort the Book of Allaah and deny (aspects of) the Prophetic Sunnah. This faction appeared in the early first century hijrah when al-Ja'd bin Dirham and <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> brought in the use of Aristotelian and neo-Platonic language to speak about theology. The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> took it from them, and then a series of sects appeared who took this same path, including the <u>Raafidee Hishaamiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/karraamiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karraamiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Maturidiyyah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/saalimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saalimiyyah</font></a></u> and others. Amongst them were <b><a href='tags/mujassimah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mujassimah</font></a></b> and amongst them were <b>Mu'attilah</b> and both (errant) ways are founded upon the same <i><a href='tags/ilm-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ilm al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></i> which is a term that represents the philosophical baggage of the Hellenized nations (Jews, Christians, Sabeans) who incorporated the metaphysical language and terminology of <a href='tags/aristotle.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aristotle</font></a> in theological discussion and debate. Before reading this series of articles you must do some background research to be able to follow along. The recommended articles for study are <a href=index17f5.html?lxtuo>this article</a> (provides good historical background and context), <a href=series/aristotle-philo-judaeus-augustine--the-sabeans-the-mutazilites--and-the-asharites.html>this series</a> (<b>Aristotle, <a href='tags/philo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philo</font></a> Judaeus, <a href='tags/augustine.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Augustine</font></a>, the <a href='tags/sabeans.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sabeans</font></a>, the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites</b>), <a href=series/destroying-the-allegation-of-tajsim-and-tashbih-against-ahl-al-sunnah.html>this series</a> (<b>Destroying the Allegation of <a href='tags/tajsim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tajsim</font></a> and Tashbih Against Ahl al-Sunnah</b>) and <a href=index1d7c.html?qcsxk>Part 4</a>  and <a href=indexdc8f.html?sudai>Part 5</a> of a series dealing with the creation or eternity of the universe between the Mutakallimeen (Ahl al-Kalaam, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots) and the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mutafalsifah</font></a> (al-Farabi, Ibn Sina). The reader is also encouraged to study articles on this site through which it will become clear that todays Ash'aris do not follow Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah), but those later ones (<u><a href='tags/ibn-fawrak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Fawrak</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi</font></a></u>, <u>al-Qushayree</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a></u>, <u>al-Raazee</u>, <u><a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/al-taftazani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Taftazani</font></a></u>) who came after him and, through their own input and influence, took <b>the early Kullaabi-Ash'ari creed</b> in the direction of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Soofiyyah, Gnostic illuminists, eventually merging <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> with <a href='tags/falsafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Falsafah</font></a> as was done by the later ones. The evidence for that is overwhelming and can be found in articles on this site.     <P>
<b>What is known as "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" today is not what Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> died upon. Many of the smart and shrewd ones amongst todays <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> (posing as Ash'aris) know this very well and hence, they describe "<a href="tags/ashariyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ariyyah</font></a>" as a "<u>dynamic approach in theology</u>" and not necessarily a fixed set of doctrines (because of the presence of much conflict, contradiction and inconsistency that is inherent in the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> school). This is just one example of the many frauds they perpetrate against innocent Muslims who simply want to know the creed brougth by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and believed by the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), which is in accord with the <i>fitrah</i> and which is devoid of the conceptual baggage of that heretical <a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a> (a cover label for "<i>philosophy</i>") which they entered into the Ummah, split the Muslims and brought trials and calamities upon them.</b>    <P>
As for <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a>, an online biographical account states:    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/ibrahim-osi-efa.gif style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" align="right" border="1" border=0>Shaykh Ibrahim was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He was blessed with the opportunity to study several classical disciplines at the hands of some of the holders of the tradition such as Murabit al-Haj, al-Habib Umar b. Hafiz and Shaikh Hassan al-Hindi. Initially studying for three years in Syria and Mauritania, Ustaz Ibrahim was then blessed with the opportunity to spend over six years in the illuminated city of Tarim, Hadramaut where he studied under the qualified hands of teachers such as al-Habib Kazim al-Saqqaf, al-Habib Ali al-Jifri and al-Shaikh Umar Husain al-Khatib. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> was one of the founders of several Islamic initiatives including the Ibn Abbas Institute, Starlatch Press, Badr Language Institute and the Greensville Trust. Shaykh <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> currently resides in Liverpool, England with his wife and two children.</blockquote>    <P>
It is clear that the teachers of this man are <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, gnostic-illuminists, mystics and those calling to saint-worship - matters which <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> was free and innocent of.     <P>
In this series of articles we are going to deconstruct the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> which is taught through his course entitled <b><a href='tags/micro-madrasa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Micro Madrasa</font></a></b>. Our aim in these articles is to allow the reader to see the clear difference between what the Righteous Salaf were upon and between what the Ash'aris and Maturidis inherited from <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. In the course of these articles many of the historical and academic frauds of those posing as "Ash'aris" today and the Maturidis will become clear by Allaah's permission.     <P>
Throughout this series we will refer to <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> and his theological family as <b>the Jahmiyyah</b>, since <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a> (and al-Ja'd bin Dirham) are the primary origin points for their theology, and the term "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" is really an umbrella term for all those factions who built their theology upon the conceptual baggage and terminology brought into the Ummah by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the first century hijrah.   </blockquote></div> <P>




<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Definition of <a href="tags/tawhid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tawhid</font></a></font>    <P>
<blockquote>  In  <b>Introducing Theology</b>, <u>the Ten Principles</u> (Year 1, Session 1), <a href='tags/ibrahim-osi-efa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibrahim Osi-Efa</font></a> provides a definition for <i><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></i>:    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>01.</b> When the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (an umbrella term also  incorporating the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Maturidiyyah) wrongly thought that proving Allaah's existence was the core foundation of the deen of Islaam - [and they did so using a corrupt, flawed proof which, when analyzed and taken through to it's actual logical outcome,  proves the opposite, that there was no "act" of creation that took place] - they claimed <u>the first obligatio</u>n is to investigate and prove belief in a creator (<i>al-nadhar wal-istidlaal</i>). <b>The claim of this being the first obligation is written textually by the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> such as al-Qaadee Abd al-Jabbaar, Ibrahim al-Nadhaam, al-Zamakhsharee, and the Asha'ris such as <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, al-Baghdadi, <a href='tags/al-juwaynee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Juwaynee</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-aamidee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Aamidee</font></a>, and likewise the Maturidis, Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, and Abu al-Mu'een al-Nasafi and others</b>. As a result of this fundamental error (see <a href=index7b25.html?moitybx>Part 1</a>), they also erred in understanding the reality of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> the Messengers were sent with, and hence in their definitions, they restricted the meaning of this <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to be centred around the qualities and descriptions for the "cause" (behind the universe) they had identified through their kalam argument. This is what Ibrahim Osi Efa does next, where he lays the foundations for his audience through incorrect, deficient definitions of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> that will corrupt their understanding and leave them vulnerable (over time) to falling into the greatest of that which Allaah forbade, setting up partners with Him in worship (<i>shirk</i>), thinking, through incorrect definitions, that they are not committing shirk.     <P>
<b>02.</b> The Ash'aris make mistakes in defining and understanding the terms (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1608;&#1581;&#1610;&#1583;</span>) "<i><b><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></b></i>", (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1604;&#1607;</span>) "<i><b>ilah</b></i>", (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) "<i><b>ibaadah</b></i>" and they also restrict the matter of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to knowledge (<i>ilm</i>) and statement (<i>qawl</i>) and they largely neglect intent (<i>qasd</i>), pursuit (<i>talab</i>) and action (<i>amal</i>), the consequence of which is that so long as a person affirms Allaah as the sole creator, sustainer and provider, then whatever he does in his pursuits and actions will never cause him to enter into shirk.  And thus, where they make mention of "<i>worshipping Allaah alone</i>" then it is upon the understanding that a person only commits shirk if he worships others <u>whilst believing</u> they have power and control over creation, life, death, benefit and harm. In other words, worship is only worship, when it is accompanied with the belief that the thing being worshipped has the qualities or attributes (ruboobiyyah) belonging only to Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
<b>03.</b> He defines <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, linguistically as, "<i>to know that something is one</i>" and this is then developed into the three aspects that define the (deficient) <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Ash'aris and Maturidis: <b><u>a)</u> Allaah is one in His <u>essence</u>, accepting no division.</b> By which they mean Allaah is not a <i><a href='tags/jism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jism</font></a></i> (body), not <a href='tags/composite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>composite</font></a>, and this is based upon Aristotle's "<i>immaterial, unembodied, immmutable</i>" first cause from which the Aristotle's  "<u>Ten Categories</u>" are denied, this comprising the bulk of their language of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>. <b><u>b)</u> Allaah is one in His <u>attributes</u>, there being none to resemble Him.</b> This is affirmation of the attributes without resemblance but it is not upon what has come in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and what Companions and the Salaf were upon, rather it comprises negating much of what Allaah affirmed for himself, because it entails "<i><a href='tags/jismiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jismiyyah</font></a></i>" and "<i>hawaadith</i>" upon their Aristotelian conceptual baggage, and thus, the mechanisms of <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ta'weel</font></a></i> and <i>tafweed</i> to deal with the apparent <a href='tags/tajseem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajseem</font></a> and <a href='tags/tashbeeh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tashbeeh</font></a> in the revealed texts. <b><u>c)</u> Allaah is one in His <u>actions</u>, there being no partner to Him.</b> By which they mean the belief that only Allaah creates, provides and sustains, something that the Mushriks affirm and do not deny, and which does not enter a person into <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>. <u>In reality</u>, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> do not actually affirm "actions" for Allaah, as in actions that are ascribed to His essence, as this would mean "hawaadith" (events) taking place in his essence, and hence to avoid this, they implement the principle (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1604; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1601;&#1593;&#1608;&#1604;</span>) to deny actions for Allaah (refer to <a href=index1d7c.html?qcsxk>this article</a> on this site for an elaboration of this).  The point here is that collectively, these three affairs (and in each one there are flaws), they do not constitute the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers and this is a deficient, rather, false definition of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (even if it contains elements which are true). The <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> the Messengers came with is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1601;&#1585;&#1575;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) "<b>to single out Allaah with (all forms) of worship</b>" and this message is very apparent in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and through the disputes between the Messengers and the people to whom they were sent.     <P>
<b>04.</b> In classical dictionaries, the word <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> is the masdar (verbal noun) of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1614;&#1581;&#1614;&#1617;&#1583; &#1610;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614;&#1581;&#1616;&#1617;&#1583;&#1615;</span>), which means "<i><u>to ascribe </u>oneness</i> to something" and is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1580;&#1593;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;&#1575;</span>), "making something one" (ascribing oneness to something) as explained in al-Fayrozabaadee's <i>al-Qamus al-Muheet</i>. And ascribing oneness (as it relates to Allaah) <b>legislatively</b> is in knowledge (<i><b>ilm</b></i>), belief (<i><b>i'tiqaad</b></i>), speech (<i><b>qawl</b></i>) (<u>as it relates to Allaah</u>) and intent (<i><b>iraadah</b></i>) and action (<i><b>amal</b></i>) (<u>as it relates to the servant</u>), in terms of his <i>ibaadah</i> (worship) of His Lord, to make that for no one and make it only for Allaah alone. In the definition of Ibrahim Osi Efa, which is the standard definition of the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a>, he has restricted it to only knowledge, as in to merely affirm in belief and speech that Allaah is one in His essence, attributes and actions. Whereas the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is in two matters, <u>a)</u> the Tawheed that relates to affirmation (<i><a href='tags/ithbaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ithbaat</font></a></i>) and knowledge (<i>ma'rifah</i>) believed by the hearts and affirmed with the tongue and <u>b)</u> the Tawheed that relates to intent (<i>qasd</i>) and pursuit (<i>talab</i>), meaning, the actions (worship) of the heart and limbs being directed only to Allaah alone. <u>Tawhid  in knowledge</u> is what is comprised in Surah al-Ikhlaas (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1602;&#1615;&#1604;&#1618; &#1607;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1571;&#1614;&#1581;&#1614;&#1583;&#1612;</span>) and <u>Tawhid in action</u> in what is comprised in Surah al-Kaafiroon (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1614;&#1575; &#1571;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1576;&#1615;&#1583;&#1615; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1576;&#1615;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span>).     <P>
<b>05.</b> As for the meaning of <i>ilaah</i> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1604;&#1607;</span>), <u>Ibn Mandhur</u> says in <i>Lisan al-Arab</i> (13/467), "<b>al-Ilaah is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and everything that is taken as a deity (ma'bood) besides Him is an ilah (deity) to the one taking it as such</b>." <u>Al-Zajaaj</u> says in <i>Tafseer <a href='tags/asmaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asmaa</font></a> Allaah al-Husnaa</i> (p.26), "<b>And the meaning of our saying "ilaah" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1573;&#1604;&#1575;&#1607;</span>) then it is the one deserving of worship, and it is Allaah the Exalted, the one deserving of it as opposed to those besides Him</b>."

This is something that has not been found till now except the dualists, those who believe in two gods, one of them gentle (wise), who does good and the other one foolish, that does evil. But as for taking a deity (ma'bood) besides Allaah, the Exalted, then those who enter into that are many</i>..." He also explains a little later that no one has ever believed that what he is worshipping besides Allaah is his creator, sustainer and provider: "<i>The knowledge (of a person) that this sculptured stone (idol) at this hour is not the one that created me and created the heavens and the earth is necessary knowledge. Thus it is impossible for a large multitude to come to agreement over [such a false religion]. Hence, it is necessary that the worshippers of idols have some other objective besides that. And the Scholars have mentioned a number of angles in this regard...</i>" Then he explains six reasons why people worship others besides Allaah (<u>without affirming ruboobiyyah for them</u>) and five of them are: <b>(1)</b> those who worship Angels thinking they will bring them closer to Allaah <b>(2)</b> those who worship the stars thinking they affect events on Earth <b>(3)</b> those who took talismans at specified times thinking them to have influence <b>(5)</b> those who believe Allaah indwells in their statues and thus worshipped them <b>(6)</b> those who, over the passing of time, took places where worship took place, such as mihrabs and the likes, as things to be worshipped, out of veneration of them. And as for the remaining one (the fourth), he says about it, "<i>And the fourth of them, that when a senior man died amongst them, and they believed that his supplication is answered and his <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> is accepted with Allaah, the Exalted, they took an idol in his form, and worshipped it upon the belief that that man will be an intercessor for them with Allaah on the Day of Judgement, upon what Allaah, the Exalted, has informed abuot them in this statement in His saying, "<b>[They say], these are our intercessors with Allaah</b>" (10:18)</i>." Whilst noting that they are not worshipping the idol, as they do not believe it will benefit them, but they took it as a focal point in order to direct worship to the righteous dead, that is their real intent, as <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a> makes clear a little earlier and elsewhere. In another place in his tafsir (17/63), when discussing the saying of Allaah (about the pagans), "<b>these are our intercessors with Allaah</b>" (10:18): "<i>And the fourth of them: That they made these idols and statues upon the form and shape of their Prophets and senior [righteous] ones (al-akaabir), and they claimed that when they occupied themselves with the worship of these statues, then those senior [righteous] ones (al-akaabir) will be intercessors for them with Allaah. <b>And the equivalent of this in our time is the occupation of many of the creation with the veneration of the graves of the senior [righteous] ones, upon the belief that when they venerate their graves, then they (the deceased) will become intercessors for them with Allaah</b></i>." From all of this we understand the nature of the shirk which appeared was that people began to flock to the tombs and graves of the righteous dead, and they began to dedicate worship (invocation) and the likes, and their intent was not the tombs and graves in and of themselves, but those whom they represent, the righteous dead, to seek their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>. Because the righteous dead are out of sight, then whatever is in sight (tombs and graves) becomes an alternative representation, a replacement, and thus worship that is intended to those righteous dead is channelled through what is taken as a visual representation or replacement - and this is the reality of the shirk of those who worship idols. No one ever believed in ruboobiyyah for his idol, but the idol was a focal point for worship intended for the one represented by the idol. However, just because this is a particular manifestation of shirk, it does not mean that an idol (statues and their likes) has to be involved for something to be shirk. Since, the definition of shirk is much broader as evidenced in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, it is simply to direct worship (in its forms and types) that is due to Allaah alone, to others besides Him and believing in the ruboobiyyah of those others <b><u>is not</u></b> a condition for it to be shirk.     <P>
<b>13.</b> All of the above indicates that no nation in history has claimed two creators, or a partner for Allaah in creating, and even the dualists mentioned by <a href='tags/al-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Razi</font></a>, they believe the god of light is the good god, who created everything, even if they claim that the god of darkness, is responsible for evil. So when no nation has believed in a creator besides Allaah, then the dispute with all nations who departed from the teachings of the Books and Messengers was in relation to directing worship to other than Allaah, alongside them believing that only Allaah creates, provide and sustains - and thus we see the argument of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> against them, as has preceded, that if you affirm all of this (the various aspects of ruboobiyyah only for Allaah), what has made you invoke others and worship others for aid, assistance, <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> and so on, be they idols, angels, jinn, prophets , the righteous?    <P>
<b>14.</b> Contrasting what has preceded to the understanding of <i><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></i> and <i>ibaadah</i> with the <b><a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a></b>, then they claim that <i>ibaadah</i> is only such when it is coupled with the belief in something that it has <i>uloohiyyah</i> and <i>ruboobiyyah</i>. In other words, something is only "worshipped" when the act of worship is founded upon belief that that thing has <i>ruboobiyyah</i> (has control over creation, sustenance) and they also treat uloohiyyah to be synonymous with ruboobiyyah. This is the generality of what is found with the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> and this can be exemplified through a few citations from Ahmad Zaynee Dahlaan who says in his <i>Durar al-Sanniyah</i> (p. 24), when defining du'aa (supplication), "<i>The invocation which becomes ibaadah (worship) is the invocation of the one who believes in His uloohiyyah and His right to worship, and thus they aspire to Him and humble themselves in front of him (with du'a)</i>" - and what he has done here is to tie and restrict worship with the presence of belief, which means that shirk can only take place in the presence of the belief that the entity worshipped besides Allaah has control over life, death, benefit and harm. This is made more clear in Dahlan's statement (p.34), "<i>That which causes one to fall into shirk (ishraak) is the belief in the uloohiyyah of other than Allaah, the Sublime, or the belief in (someone) besides Allaah having effect (ta'theer) [over things]</i>." And on the same page he also says, "<i>For <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Ruboobiyyah is <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Uloohiyyah</i>" - and this is false and clashes directly with the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and what all the Messengers brought. For the whole argument of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> against the Mushriks is that if you affirm Allaah's <i>ruboobiyyah</i> how then do you associate partners with Him in His <i>uloohiyyah</i>, and Allaah the Exalted said (&#1608;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1610;&#1615;&#1572;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1615; &#1571;&#1614;&#1603;&#1618;&#1579;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607;&#1616; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1575;&#1614;&#1617; &#1608;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605; &#1605;&#1615;&#1617;&#1588;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616;&#1603;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;), "<b>Most of them do not believe in Allaah except that they associate partners with Him (in worship</b>)" (12:106). Dahlan also says (p. 34), "<i>No one from the Muslims believes in the uloohiyyah of other than Allaah, and nor anyone having any (controlling effect) except Allaah, the Exalted</i>" This means that if any Muslim falls into any of those actions of shirk that resemble the actions of shirk of the people of Jaahiliyyah, this is not considered shirk for him because he did not accompany it with the belief that anyone besides Allaah creates, or has power and control over life, death, benefit and harm. This false understanding of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Ibaadah is found in the writings of all contemporary Ash'aris and Maturidis.    <P>
<b>15.</b> Upon all of this, the definitions laid down here by Ibrahim Osi Efa are deficient, false definitions of terms whose realities are clear in the language and in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and these grave and serious errors regarding these definitions from the very outset will lead a person down a path whereby he thinks that he can invoke others besides Allaah, seek rescue from them, seek refuge in them, ask them for benefit and repelling of harm and so on and so long as he does not believe that they have control over life, death, benefit and harm, he has not opposed what the Messengers called to. And so long as he believes only Allaah has control and power over things and believes Allaah is to be worshipped, then he is free to supplicate to the dead, seek rescue from them and solicit them for benefit and repelling of harm and <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> and the likes and because he does not believe they have power over life and death, benefit and harm, he is not "worshipping" them. This clashes directly with what we find in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and it shows great deviation from what is very clear and apparent in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> without ambiguity.     <P>

<div style="text-align:justify;">Allaah created mankind upon the fitrah (innate recognition of the existence of a creator and His right to be worshipped), so recognition of the creator is fitriyy, dhurooriyy and does not require reason for it to be established. However, in order to establish the hujjah, Allaah made reward and punishment based upon revealing Books and sending Messengers, and did not make it upon the fitrah (or reason) alone. So the Messengers, when they came, they appealed to the fitrah of the people, ordering them to worship Allaah alone, and where there was corruption in fitrah, an appeal to reason (aql) was made (that reason being indicated in the revealed texts itself). As for proving Allaah's existence, then this was never disputed by any nation (except very rarely), and hence, this is hardly addressed in the revealed Books. Therefore, the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers, is <b>to single out Allaah in Uloohiyyah (right to be worshipped)</b> (upon its correct meaning) and upon what is already established in the fitrah that there is no deity worthy of worship besides Allaah. Thus, acknowledgement of a creator, owner, provider (which is fitriyy, dhurooriyy), leads necessarily to directing worship only to Him alone, and the Messengers were sent to complete and perfect the fitrah. Hence, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> affirms Allaah's ruboobiyyah, affirms His names and attributes through which the hearts know, love and yearn for Him and calls for worship (in all its forms and types) to be directed only to Him alone and not to others.</div>  </td>    <P>

<b>17.</b> Thus, the reader should be aware as to exactly what Ibrahim Osi Efa means when he defines <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> as "<i>to devote oneself to God through worship, with absolute conviction that His divine essence, attributes and actions are one</i>", how do they define worship (<i>ibaadah</i>) and what is  their <i><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></i>? He does not mean the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers, but he means the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of those who opposed the Messengers by making something obligatory upon the mukallafeen (legally responsible after reaching maturity) which is <u>already established in the fitrah</u> to begin with, and making that the foundation of the religion (proving the existence of a creator), and then defining Allaah through Aristotelian conceptual baggage, and this forms the greater part of their <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> whilst neglecting the actual <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> that the Messengers were sent with. This definition given by Ibrahim Osi Efa should now be clear. You have to understand what is meant by "<i>worship</i>" in his definition and the qualification he adds to it, "<i>with absolute conviction that His divine essence, attributes and actions are one.</i>" Keeping in mind the sample statements from Ahmad Dahlaan a little ealier, essentially, it means that if you were to invoke a rock from a thousand miles away asking for relief from hardship, but without believing it is a creator alongside Allaah, and without believing it has power over life, death, benefit and harm, then you have not committed shirk. Likewise, if you invoked an angel, or a jinn for the same. Likewise, if you invoked, "<i>Yaa Alee madad</i>" (O Alee, help, come to my rescue), but you do not believe Alee (radiallaahu anhu) has ruboobiyyah, rather you believe only Allaah has ruboobiyyah, you have not committed shirk. And the same with invoking the saints and righteous dead. This is the shirk understood by these people and as you can see from what has preceded, the Mushriks of Makkah were more knowledgeable of their own shirk and the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> they denied, and they recognized the Qur'anic argument against them, which is that though you call only upon Allaah in times of dire need and calamity, knowing only He can help you in that situation, when you reach the shores safely, you invoke others besides Him, whilst acknowledging still that only He has ruboobiyyah, control over life, death, benefit and harm. Allaah, the Exalted says, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1601;&#1614;&#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1585;&#1614;&#1603;&#1616;&#1576;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1601;&#1615;&#1604;&#1618;&#1603;&#1616; &#1583;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1608;&#1615;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1614; &#1605;&#1615;&#1582;&#1618;&#1604;&#1616;&#1589;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1617;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1601;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1605;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575; &#1606;&#1614;&#1580;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1585;&#1617;&#1616; &#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1610;&#1615;&#1588;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616;&#1603;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span>), "<b>And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah (alone), making their deen (worship, devotion) purely for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others</b>" (29:65).    <P>
<b>18.</b> In the next slide Ibrahim Osi Efa states that the term "<a href="tags/tawhid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tawhid</font></a>" when synonymous with the science of theology refers to a "<i>science that enables a person to affirm religious creed on the basis of absolute proofs.</i>" We shall contend with this in the next part in this series inshaa'Allaah and explain what the <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-<a href="tags/kalaam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kalaam</font></a></font></a> mean by this and show that what they claim to be <u>absolute proofs</u> are mere mirages that do not prove what they assert to prove, namely <u>a creator</u>, <u>prophethood</u> and <u>resurrection</u>, and they sought to prove these things by abandoning the method of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and using what they claim is "<i>reason</i>" when it in fact opposes both reason and revelation together.    <P>
