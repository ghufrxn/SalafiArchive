<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with. The three ignorants in question, <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href='tags/muhammad-fahmi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Fahmi</font></a>, have tried to deceive their readers by giving a pretence of authority and evidence in trying to discredit al-Ibaanah. They have tried to mimic the format taken here on <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Asharis</font></a>.Com and have even resorted to stealing our translations of quotes from <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a>,[al-Shahrastani] and then reusing them for their own falsehood.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>The Use of Narrations Pertaining to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and the Creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to Cast Doubts About al-Ibaanah</font>     <P>
In the previous article (<a href=index44b6.html?tagwt >Part 8</a>), the likelihood of Hanafi tampering with <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> was strongly possible, however this tampering was in order to defend <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, and not to play about with al-Ash'ari's creed itself. This is unlike the tampering of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> that was done by Ash'aris (<a href=index0ab5.html?ypttf >see examples</a> of <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> tampering of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> here) - and so in a way, whilst you could excuse the Hanafi madhhabist, you certainly cannot excuse the <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> bigot in working his evil hand into <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>.    <P>
Coming to the issue now, in al-Ibaanah, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> cited some  narrations about <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> which contain severe speech. The Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who are the subject of these series of articles provided screen shots of these quotes, but they deliberately chose the printed version of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> by Bashir 'Uyun and NOT the version by al-Aseemi. The reason is quite obvious. It was because al-Aseemi, in his footnote to the relevant section he provides such information that would have exposed these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> in an instant.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Tafsil of the Talbis of the Naughty Jahmites:</b> To understand this, there are four sources that the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> alluded to, <b>a)</b> <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> (d. 571H) in al-Tabyin, <b>b)</b> Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fawqiyyah</font></a>, <b>c)</b> Bashir Uyun and <b>d)</b> Salih al-Aseemi. In the first one, <a href='tags/ibn-asakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Asakir</font></a> simply cited opening passages from <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> within his book al-Tabyin. As for the other three, they published al-Ibaanah in the contemporary period, using manuscripts, or a review of what has already been published.    <P>
In order to  show a contradiction on the subject of al-ayn (eye) being mentioned in the singular or dual, they chose to compare between Ibn Asakir's citation from <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> (one eye) and al-Aseemi (two eyes). They did not use Bashir Uyun's (one eye) which would have exposed them and showed that there is consistency. Then when it came to the issue of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, they compared Dr. Fawqiyah's (in which the Hanafi insertion is found), with Bashir Uyun's and NOT Salih al-Aseemi's for the reason that is outlined below. This selective comparison is how these people thought they could deceive the people.</div>    <P>
Let us now look at what al-Aseemi explained at the relevant point about this issue of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (pp. 402-403):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-aseemi-abu-hanifah-1.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
The narration is quoted with its isnaad:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sufyan al-Thawree said: Hammaad bin Abi Salamah said: "Convey to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> the Mushrik that I am free of him" Sulayman said: Then Sufyan said: Because he used to say that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created.</blockquote>    <P>
In the footnote al-Aseemi indicates that this narration regarding <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> is weak (da'eef). He states those who have reported it include <b>Imam al-Bukhari</b> in Tarikh al-Kabeer (which is 70 years before al-Ash'ari) at least. Here it is:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-bukhari-abu-hanifah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
So <b>al-Bukhari</b> also cited the narration. Does that mean al-Tarikh al-Kabir is tampered with? Of course not. The verifer points out in the footnote that the narration is weak.    <P>
Then al-Aseemi also points out that this narration is also mentioned by <b>al-Khatib</b> in Tarikh Baghdad, <b><a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a></b> in al-Ibaanah, <b>al-Laalika'ee</b> in Sharh Usool al-I'tiqaad, and <b>Abdullah bin Ahmad</b> in al-Sunnah - that's five other sources altogether besides al-Ibaanah. Does that mean all these works are tampered with because they mentioned this narration? Of course not, there is an explanation behind this narration, which helps to resolve this matter. And al-Aseemi discussed this matter in detail in his introduction.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>This is the real reason</b> why the Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> did not compare between Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> and Salih al-Aseemi and instead chose Bashir 'Uyun's version because he did not make reference to other authorities who also cite this narration about <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>. However, Bashir Uyun did indicate in the footnote that this saying was ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> by his grandson (Umar bin Hammad bin Abi Hanifah) and perhaps some of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu Hanifah and the Saying of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Being Created</font>    <P>
Due to restricted time we are only able to present a summary of the issue (as al-Aseemi discusses it in length and will only summarize the main points):    <P>
<ul><li> <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> cited many reports on the subject of the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and it does not mean that every single one is authentic and free of fault (in its authenticity or content), but since <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not a book of research into matters of isnaad, it does not mean the narration is authentic.    <P>
<li> There is nothing in <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> that indicates <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself considers this narration to be authentic, however <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ashari</font></a> brought a series of narrations to support what is in the previous chapter of the severity of the matter, and to merely indicate the generality of what has come in the narrations in this regard. And often, scholars mention narrations purely for the historical record to indicate what has reached them, and their intent is not that they affirm everything in them.    <P>
<li> Al-Ash'aris use of these narrations is not to establish the aqidah of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> but only to show the rejection of an affair that took place between one of the Imaams and those Imaams contemporary to him. So this from the angle of mention of history, and this is the intent of <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>. (And we see that al-Bukhari mentioned it without comment, and it was also mentioned by al-Laalikaa'ee, <a href='tags/ibn-battah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Battah</font></a>, al-Khatib, and Abdullah bin Imaam Ahmad).    <P>
<li> There is in al-Ash'ari's speech what indicates that he does not ascribe this belief to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> himself, because he mentioned three Imaams, Malik, Ibn al-Mubaarak, and al-Shaafi'ee, that they are all from those who say the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated and that they make takfir of the one who said it is created, then he said, "<i>And we did not find anyone from whom narrations are carried, and reports are transmitted, and who is followed by followers from the people of knowledge, who speaks with the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, but only the common riff-raff from the people, and the ignoramuses have said this, those who have no place.</i>" So this is what <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> said in al-Ibaanah    <P>
<li> Imam al-Laalikaa'ee narrated both the abovementioned report about <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and also other reports that conflict with it, and this is because he had access to those reports and mentioned them all from the angle of historical record, this does not mean that we now reject a part of the book and claim it has been tampered with, and other parts are fine!    <P>
<li> Making the authenticity of the entirety of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> to be based upon this report of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> within it is a very far stretch and it shows desperation on behalf of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> to discredit the book's contents which opposes their <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a> creed of negating <a href='tags/uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>uluww</font></a>, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, the sifat khabariyyah and sifat fi'liyyah.    <P>
<li> Ibn Abi Shaybah included within his musannaf a section refuting <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and he titled it "Refutation of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> in 124 issues", now does this mean that the musannaf is fabricated and tampered with and  the rest of its contents are suspect? Of course not, this shows the spurious reasoning in trying to discredit <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a>.  </ul>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu Hanifah Is Free of This Saying</font>    <P>
As for the issue of whether <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> held this saying or not, then the following points are raised by al-Aseemi:    <P>
<ul><li>A Muslim rejoices in knowing of the sound creed of any person, let alone an Imaam from the Imaams.    <P>
<li> A person's creed is known through what he wrote, what is authentically narrated from him through his students or those who are trustworty and reliable. And from this route we see that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> holds the same view as all others from the Salaf.    <P>
<li> There are many reports that indicate this and because we are short of time, we cannot cite them, but we will simply briefly mention them: From them <b>a)</b> What occurs in al-Fiqh al-Akbar, the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is not created <b>b)</b> <a href='tags/al-khatib-al-baghdadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Khatib al-Baghdadi</font></a> reports in his Tarikh (15/515) that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> used to say <a href='tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm bin Safwan</font></a> is a kafir (which would have been for the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created) <b>c)</b> Also (from al-Khatib) the report of Bishr al-Walid from Abu Yusuf that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> use to censure Jahm and criticize his saying <b>d)</b> Just like al-Khatib also reports that Sufyan al-Thawree and Nu'maan bin Thabit (<a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>) hold <a href='tags/the-quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Quran</font></a></font></a> is the speech of Allaah uncreated  <b>e)</b> All of the followers of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> have reported in their works that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated. Ibn Abdal Barr brings a narration about <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> being asked about this matter and he stated the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah and prohibited disputing about this matter (al-Intiqaa p. 317-318) and he brings other narrations from Abu Yusuf clearly ascribing to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated <b>f)</b> All of the trustworthy ones from his school associates have narrated this, such al-Tahawi in his aqidah <b>g)</b> Imam Ahmad mentions in al-Radd alal-Jahmiyyah that some from the associates of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> followed <a href='tags/al-jahm-bin-safwan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/jahm-bin-safwan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahm bin Safwan</font></a></font></a>  in the issue of the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and this shows that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> himself did not hold this view <b>h)</b> Abu Bakr al-Marwazi reports that Imam Ahmad freed <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> from this belief (Tarikh Baghdad, 15/517) <b>i)</b> Al-Laalikaa'ee in his establishes that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> used to hold the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated and make takfir of the one who said it was created (2/277) <b>j)</b> <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> affirms that the belief of <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is uncreated (Minhaj al-Sunnah 2/106).    <P>
<li> Ibn Hajar explains that Ismaa'eel bin Hammad bin al-Nu'man (<a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>), the grandson, would ascribe this to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a>, and this grandson was a <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, as is reported by Imam al-Tabari (See Lisan al-Mizan 1/517, Tarikh Bagdad 7/216). This claim of Ismaa'eel was rejected by others in the time, such as Bishr bin al-Waleed, who said to Ismaa'il, "It is your view, yes, but  not the view of your forefathers" (Intiqaa of Ibn Abdal Barr p. 318). It appears that the claim that <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> said this statement was spread by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (from his offspring) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, as there from some of his associates who inclined towards the way of Jahm. However, the scholars freed him from that. And as for the debate between <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> and Abu Yusuf on this matter, it was pertaining to whether the one who says the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created is a kaafir or not, and not on the issue of whether the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> itself is created.    <P>
<li> If <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> had said such a saying the rejection would have been overwhelming and it would have been reported in abundance, and this is not the case.    <P>
</ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>From what has preceded, <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> (rahimahullah) is free of the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and it also proves that those who try to revile the contents of the book al-Ibaanah <u>only because it includes a report in this regard</u> is an extremely weak justification especially considering that numerous other authorities  have also cited this report in their works (and some of them without comment, such as al-Bukhaaree). And it becomes clear that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> simply cited purely for the historical record that this is what has been narrated, not that he actually believes in what is narrated, and this practice is found amongst the scholars, when they collate everything in their knowledge regarding a certain subject area.</div>    <P>
In conclusion, using this issue of the mention of this (weak) report pertaining to <a href='tags/abu-hanifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hanifah</font></a> in order to discredit the entire book is <b>a red herring</b> and you can actually perceive the stink in the air, if you just close your eyes, concentrate a little, and breathe. It appears that GF Haddaad forgot to change the nappies of these infants after feeding with them with the rotten leftovers of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> of antiquity.   <P>
