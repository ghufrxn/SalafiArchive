<div class='sidebar'>A faction of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> deceptively associating themselves with and tarnishing the good name of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> have attempted to argue that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is not from the authorship of Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> and that it has been tampered with.

<img src=assets/images/jahmee-doubts-stake.gif align=left border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Thunderous Fireworks To Instill Shock and Awe Into Faint-Hearted, Pusillanimous, Stinking Hypocritical, Intellectual Fraudsters,  <a href='tags/abu-bilal-maliki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bilal Maliki</font></a>, <a href='tags/faqir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faqir</font></a>, and <a href="tags/muhammad-fahmi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhammad Fahmi</font></a></font>    <P>
In order to truly appreciate the significance of this installment of this series, please be sure to read <a href=indexbaa4.html?xoufz>Part 1</a>, <a href=index69b8.html?uqxke>Part 2</a> and <a href=indexb479.html?ohgey>Part 3</a> and get a good grasp as to what is going on, because in this installment there are going to be some loud and illustrious fireworks and you need to make sure you don't miss anything. <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> beware, you better take cover, and head off back to that ditch of Khurasan from where you true and real ancestry reared its ugly countenance.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/pusillanimous.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0>These Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have not had the honesty to address the real issue detailed in <a href=indexb479.html?ohgey>Part 3</a>, which is that there is absolutely zero material significance as to whether al-ayn (eye) is mentioned in the singular or dual, as it is totally irrelevant to the wider issue of the fact that the later Asharites sided with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in denying the Sifat khabariyyah and became disputants to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, al-Ashari, and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (and likewise <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> and even Ibn Fawrak) in this matter. These contemptibly fearful "men" are proven to be deceivers, fraudsters and liars in that they are (attempting) to use a wholly irrelevant issue to blind the audience from the elephant sitting on their nose-ends.    <P>
However, to finish off their deception for good, in this installment we want to carry on where we left off in <a href=index69b8.html?uqxke>Part 2</a>. In that article we pointed out that in all four manuscripts used by Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> it is found that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> used al-ayn (eye) in both singular and dual in a particular chapter dealing specifically with the attributes of face, two hands and two eyes, and that he used "Two eyes" in the chapter heading, but within the body of the text used just the singular "eye" in reference to the genus of eye. So the fact that this variation is established in all the manuscripts, shows that trying to pretend that <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> is unreliable due to this variation is an academic fraud and shows the dumbness, shallowness and lowliness in intellect, besides dishonesty in a wider sense.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Printed Versions Cited by the Pusillanimous <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
Just to lay the background to what follows, in their article they made reference to four source texts as it relates to al-Ibaanah. They are as follows:    <P>
<ol><li> The verification and print of <b>Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Hussain Mahmood</b> (1397H). She used four manuscripts.    <P>
<li> The printed edition of <b>Bashir Uyun</b> (third edition, 1990) and what he did was to take all previously published versions of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> including that of Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> Mahmood, and prepare a consistent version in which there is agreement between all manuscripts and previously printed versions, and to produce a standardized text.    <P>
<li> The verification of <b>Salih al-Aseemi</b>, which was for a PhD doctorate in aqidah, printed in 1429H, and this is by far the best and most thorough. He used six manuscripts and pointed out the flaws in previously published versions, including the above two.    <P>
<li> And sections from <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> quoted by <b>Ibn Asakir</b> (d. 571H) who wrote the book Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari to defend <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> against the claim that he wrote <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> out of deception, and to please the Hanbalis. Ibn Asakir in this work, believe it or not, is actually refuting the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> who are peddling the very claim against which Ibn Asakir wrote the book in the first place! In this book Ibn Asaakir quoted a lengthy section from <b>the opening of the book</b> within which there is the mention of affirmation of face, hands and eye. Pay attention, here Ibn Asaakir did not quote the whole of Ibaanah, just the opening part.   </ol>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Original Inconsistency Pointed Out by the <a href="tags/jahmites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmites</font></a></font>    <P>
Once this is clear, it should be pointed out that in order to show the discrepancy on the matter of the attribute of eyes, the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> compared between the verification of Salih al-Aseemi and what was quoted by Ibn Asakir. And sure enough there is a difference, this is not denied. Let's just put this here for the record:    <P>
The print version verified by Salih al-'Asimi, published in 1429H, here is the scans the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> provided:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana21.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
And also:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana31.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
In both of these texts we see that al-Ash'ari's statement affirming that Allah has two eyes. Then the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> quoted from Ibn Asakir in Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari in which Ibn Asakir (d. 571) quotes from whatever manuscript he was in possession of:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana51.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
And also:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana61.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
Here we see the eye used in the singular not in the dual. So what they have done is to compare al-Aseemi's tahqiq with Ibn Asakir's quote.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Moving From Micro Detail to Macro Picture</font>    <P>
To understand what is going on, what is happening here is that our nose is next to the tree in the forest. We need to get out of the forest and be able to see the whole forest. You know the phrase, "<b>can't see the wood for the trees</b>", and what this means is: "<i>If someone can't see the wood for the trees, they are unable to understand what is important in a situation because they are giving too much attention to details</i>" and also, "<i>If someone can't see the wood for the trees, they get so caught up in small details that they fail to understand the bigger picture</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Another way to put it is that the microscope is zoned in too powerfully in one very specific spot, we need to lift it up a little bit and zoom out, or another way to put it is that we are zoomed into someones back garden on Google maps and we need to zoom out see the whole neighbourhood, or area. So you get the picture now... So what these <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> are doing is that they have grabbed hold of you, and stuck your nose right against the wall, and they won't let go of you so that you are unable to see the entire building. So what we are going to do is to rescue from those <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, and take you 100 yards back from the wall so you can see the house, take you 1000 metres above so you can have a birds-eye view of the neighbourhood - in other words we are going to do a survey of all of what is found in the various manuscripts and published versions of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> as it relates to the mention of the attribute of eye or two eyes. When the Pusillanimous Jahmee realizes you have "got it", it is imperative that he gives up and apologizes for his fraud, so we will be watching these jesters carefully and see how they behave. </div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/fireworks-collection.gif align=right vspace=8 hspace=6 border=0>So lets begin in earnest:    <P>
Firework Key: <b>Roman Candles:</b> they produce flames and bursting effects, accompanied with crackling flashes and loud reports. <b>Rockets:</b> they are like mortar shells with a big bang at the peak of their flight, there is some suspense and anticipation involved, with a trail of sparks and impressive burst. <b>Aerial Shells:</b> These are the kings of fireworks, spectacular visually, and usually the loudest, used by professionals and are launched the same way military mortar shells are launched. We may or may not employ these depending on the brazenness of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, but we think that the basic, kiddy stuff should do the job and quickly have them on their heels.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Fireworks</font>    <P>
<u><b>Roman Candle 1: Dr. Fawqiyyah's Four Manuscript Tahqiq Actually Agrees Perfectly with al-Aseemi's Six Manuscript  Tahqiq in the Mention of Two Eyes and Bashir Uyun's Standardization Agrees with Ibn Asakirs(!!)</b></u>    <P>
So here is al-Aseemi's as provided by the Jahmites::    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana21.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is Dr. Fawqiyyah's equivalent:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-FM-eyes-a.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is Bashir Uyun's equivalent    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-BU-eyes-a.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Compared with Ibn Asakir's:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana51.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>The result of this comparison:</b> The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have to admit that Bashir Uyun's is in agreement with Ibn Asakir's version, and maybe he chose to standardize this passage with Ibn Asakir instead of relying upon the later manuscripts, can't really fault that. At the same time, al-Aseemi' is in agreement with Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> and between them they used six manuscripts. However, as we pointed out in  <a href=index69b8.html?uqxke>Part 2</a> and <a href=indexb479.html?ohgey>Part 3</a> this variation is absolutely immaterial and means absolutely nothing. But the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> want your nose squeezed against the wall so you can't see anything else.    <P>
<b>Deception and Fraud Uncovered:</b> Why did the Pusillanmous, Contemptibly Wretched <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> Compare Al-Aseemi with Ibn Asaakir instead of comparing Bashir Uyun with Ibn Asakir? Answer that question! Or for that matter, instead of comparing Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fawqiyyah</font></a> with al-Aseemi? Same thing.    <P>
<u><b>Roman Candle 2: Dr. Fawqiyyah's Manuscript Tahqiq Actually Agrees Perfectly with al-Aseemi's Manuscript  Tahqiq in the Mention of Two Eyes and Bashir Uyun's Standardization Agrees with Ibn Asakirs(!!)</b></u>    <P>
OK, we liked the last firework and we have an opportunity to repeat it again, because circumstances allow us to. In the second place where the mention of the attribute of eye (singular or dual) is mentioned in all these four sources:    <P>
So here is al-Aseemi's as provided by the Jahmites::    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana31.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is Dr. Fawqiyyah's equivalent:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-FM-eyes-b.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And here is Bashir Uyun's equivalent    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-BU-eyes-b.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Compared with Ibn Asakir's:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibana61.jpg border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>The result of this comparison:</b> Same firework, same noise and same display. The <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> have to admit that Bashir Uyun's is in agreement with Ibn Asakir's version, and maybe he chose to standardize this passage with Ibn Asakir instead of relying upon the later manuscripts, can't really fault that. At the same time, al-Aseemi' is in agreement with Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fawqiyyah</font></a>.

<div class='sidebar'><b>The infants watching are not scared because they are innocent and do not know how to deceive.

<b><u>Rocket 1: Complete Agreement Between All Manuscripts in the Chapter Dealing Specifically With Face, Two Hands and Two Eyes</u></b>    <P>
We are now stepping up a little and we are going to use the rocket! By now, we think that <b>the Pusillanimous <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> should be well on their way at the other end of town, fleeing for shame</b>. But you have to remember that we are dealing with a particular species of <a href='tags/jahmite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmite</font></a>, you must not cut any corners and make sure that the finish is <u>clinical in nature</u>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now recall that Ibn Asakir (d. 571H) quoted only the beginning part of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> (see pages 152 to 163 of Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari) and he did not quote the entire book, since his intent was merely  to show al-Ash'aris creed (which is presented in summary form at the beginning of al-Ibanah) and show his agreement with <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ahmad</font></a>. Therefore, to use what Ibn Asaakir has cited, which is only a small fraction of the entir ebook as the criterion and point of comparison is not really justifiable, and it is not honest. It would have been great if Ibn Asakir quoted it all. So what we are going to do here is to compare between the three published versions (Dr. <a href='tags/fawqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fawqiyyah</font></a>, Al-Aseemi, Bashir Uyun) with each other and see their complete and perfect agreement.</div>    <P>
First, Dr. Fawqiyyah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-FM-eyes-c.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Just to make a quick note here and to let you into an later <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> secret. <b>THEY DO NOT REALLY AFFIRM THE ATTRIBUTES OF HEARING AND SEEING</b>. But you have to be one of the elite, and read their high end books to be in the know. Here was their problem:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>If Allah is hearing and seeing, then his hearing and seeing  must relate to his creation. To illustrate, the words you are going to speak tomorrow, have not been spoken yet, and so Allah has not heard your speech (even if He knows it in knowledge). The same with your three year old baby which you haven't had yet, Allah has not seen it (even if he knows it in knowledge). So this created a big problem for the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> because hearing and seeing that which is heard and seen must imply recency by virtue of the fact that what is seen and heard is originatd and recent (i.e. what takes place in the creation of all things heard and seen). Now, <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>  (followed by Ash'ari) even though they opposed the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in some issues, were not able to refute them on the issue of what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> called "hawadith" (events, occurrences). So they submitted to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> on this issue and this is what really characterized the Kullabi creed, they denied Allah's chosen actions (sifaat fi'liyyah, af'aal ikhtiyaariyah) such as anger, pleasure, <a href='tags/istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>istiwaa</font></a>, majee, <a href='tags/ityaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ityaan</font></a> and likewise speech (<a href='tags/kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalaam</font></a>) which they denied and invented a new doctrine called <a href='tags/kalam-nafsi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kalam Nafsi</font></a> (speech is only the meaning in the self, and cannot be multiple instances of speech). So what the later <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> did was to start making ta'wil of hearing and seeing until they made it synonymous with knowledge ('ilm) in order to flee from the implications (of huduth, recency). Refer to the book Kitaab Lub&#257;b ul-&#703;Uq&#363;l (p. 213-318) of Y&#363;suf bin Muhammad al-Mukal&#257;t&#299; (d. 626H), and this is one of the books of the later Ash&#703;arites The <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> were slowly forced to retreat into al-I'tizal when they began to realize steadily that they could not display consistency and coherence in the face of Mu'tazili arguments pertaining to huduth (origination, recency).</div>    <P>
In reality, upon verification, the <a href='tags/asharites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arites</font></a> only affirm life (hayat) and knowledge (ilm) as attributes. The rest are all problematic for them (speech, hearing, seeing, power, wish) - and you  have to really read into the kalam sophistries they had to invent in order to maintain a straight face to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. But this is a digression and its for another article, back to the topic.    <P>
Then Bashir Uyun's:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-BU-eyes-c.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Then Salih al-Aseemi's:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ibanah-SA-eyes-c.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<b>The result of this comparison:</b> Now, we do not have anything from Ibn Asaakir to compare here, but all these printed versions of al-Ibaanah, together with all the manuscripts used are identical in this chapter. And in this chapter we see that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> used the dual form of eye (aynan) in the chapter heading but used the singular form in the body of the text on two occasions. So this renders spurious the attempt of the PJs that the variation (between singular and dual) is a sign of tampering. If it is proven and established that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a> himself used the singular and dual interchangeably, then it is ridiculous to use this as a sign of tampering in order to discredit the book. But what else can you expect from snotty little kids who were not left with any tissues by G.F. Haddad?    <P>
<b>Deception and Fraud Uncovered:</b> Why did the Pusillanmous,  <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a> not compare altogether different sections of <a href='tags/al-ibanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ibanah</font></a> that relate to, lets say, <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">uluww</font></a></font></a>, or the chapter that specifically deals with the attributes of Face, Hands and Eyes as attributes of Allah's essence, and see if there is any discrepancy therein? Because they would be uncovered and because they are intellectual fraudsters and were simply out to deceive the believers and are trying to call to the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmites</font></a>, opposing and disputing with <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, al-Ashari, <a href='tags/al-qalanisi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qalanisi</font></a>, al-Muhasibi, Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> (and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a>, and even Ibn Fawrak) LET ALONE, the entirety of the Salaf.    <P>
Finally, Sayf al-Din al-Aamidee (d. 631H) wrote in his book Ghayat al-Maraam (p. 135)    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1589;&#1581;&#1575;&#1576; &#1605;&#1606; &#1586;&#1575;&#1583; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1608;&#1571;&#1579;&#1576;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605; &#1576;&#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1583; &#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578; &#1586;&#1575;&#1574;&#1583;&#1577; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1605;&#1575; &#1571;&#1579;&#1576;&#1578;&#1606;&#1575;&#1607; &#1608;&#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1605;&#1579;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1602;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1580;&#1607; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1606;&#1610;&#1606; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606; </div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from the associates (of the madhhab)  are those who added to this, and affirmed knowledge of the existence of attributes additional to what we have mentioned, and this  is the likes of al-baq&#257;' (lasting, remaining), wajh (face), <b>&#703;ayn&#257;n (two eyes)</b>, yad&#257;n (two hands)</blockquote>    <P>
And then we have al-Juwayni (d. 478H) stating in al-Irshad (p. 155):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/juwayni-face-hands-eyes.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Chapter: Two hands, two eyes and face.

These are two texts from two very prominent <a href='tags/ashari-scholars.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ashari Scholars</font></a> who affirm that there are those from their school who affirm two eyes for Allah, and they are referring to <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> amongst others. <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> affirmed two eyes as occurs in his book al-Tamhid, <a href=indexdac3.html?tlyai>you can read that here</a> where he said:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if someone says: Distinguish for us between the attributes of His Essence (dhaat) from the attributes of His Actions, so that I may know that.

Then in al-Maqaalaat (tahqiq Muhammad Muhyi al-Din, Egypt, 1950), al-Ashari affirms two eyes for Allah, whilst quoting the view of Ahl al-Sunnah, which he says that he follows and adheres to:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ashari-maqalat-sifat-khabar.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
So he mentioned here face, two hands and two eyes. After all of this, is is sustainable to deny that <a href='tags/al-ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/ashari.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'ari</font></a></font></a>, like <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a> and Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari and others affirmed two eyes for Allaah?    <P>
<b>You see, these people falsely ascribing themselves to the aqidah of al-Ashari are on the same side of the fence as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> whom <a href='tags/ibn-kullab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Kullab</font></a>, al-Ashari, <a href='tags/al-baqillani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/baqillani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Baqillani</font></a></font></a>, and <a href='tags/al-bayhaqi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Bayhaqi</font></a> all refuted for not affirming these attributes as attributes of the essence without ta'wil and tafwid.</b>    <P>
