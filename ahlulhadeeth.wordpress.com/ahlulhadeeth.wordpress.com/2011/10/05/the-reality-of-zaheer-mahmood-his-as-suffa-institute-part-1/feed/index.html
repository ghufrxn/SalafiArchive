					<description><![CDATA[Masha&#039;allah brother.

If only the Ummah spent as much energy on finding common ground between brothers as they do in encouraging disunity and dissension, perhaps then we wouldn&#039;t be getting slaughtered all over the world like we are today.

It should not be &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; - if only we had a &quot;my brother thinks this, whereas I disagree with my beloved Brother..&quot; approach.

SubhanAllah - what a waste of your time this article was. What an effort to create disunity. Muslims are getting butchered and all you can do is ramble about how wrong and misguided one particular group of Muslims is?? 

My brothers, stick together, stay United. stay as one Ummah - like our beloved messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him wanted).]]></description>
