why people legislate things like this is to me beyond belief how can these learned scholars distort the real islam we have two great things to go along  with and that is quran and sunnah for our beloved prophet pbuh in his last sermon he emphsized this about  holding on to the quran and sunnah ,we all say we are alhus sunnah wal jammah so we should stick to the sunnah.we should avoid the books written by scholars who distort islam. islam was completed and set for us over 1400 years ago]]></description>
