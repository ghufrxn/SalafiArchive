we could not agree more, as you rightly said for us it is just sticking and adopting the Sunnah and where are differences to apply the islamic sciences like usool al-fiqh and mastalah to rectify any apparent contradictions. The peple of innovation have started a new trend that all fiqhee differences are allowed and rectification is deemed an attack. The muqallideen even under the garb of Ahlul Hadeeth should learn the difference and clear distinction between khilaaf and ikhtilaaf because the moment everything to them is iktilaaf.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its really surprising to see that how Ahnaf can commit one sin to rectify another sin. They allow triple talaq in one sitting as three talaq  which is against the sunnah of Rasulullah (SAW) and then to rectify it, do halala which is accursed by Rasulullah (SAW). This is a clear proof that if you leave the sunnah of Rasulullah (SAW), you will be doomed.]]></description>
