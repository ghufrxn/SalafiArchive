Masha-Allah,  You all have done great job.

I have one questions for you ..
That in the Dawah leaflets  “ Introduction to the Salafi Dawah” --- you have mentioned the names of big scholars –
But some you didn’t mentioned like ---

Nasai, Baihaqi, Tirmidhi, Ibne Khuzaima, Ibne Hajar, Ibne Hibban, Hakim, Az-Zuhri, Darqutni, (Rahemahullahu Anhum) and many more…

My question to you is that are they not Salafs Swaleheen ??? 

Please reply also to me..
