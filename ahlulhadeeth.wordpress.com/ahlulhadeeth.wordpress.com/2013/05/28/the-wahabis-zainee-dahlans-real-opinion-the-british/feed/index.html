					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] We intend to show how these DEO-KATS were exactly holding it down and why their is this mad respect for the DEO-KATS. Firstly the stepbrothers of the DEO-KATS, the BAR-DOGS (Barailwi) (We apologise for using the word dog as some people might find this offensive and we apologise again but the fact is the barailwis call themselves the dogs of Madeenah and the dogs of &#8220;Gauth-Pak or Gauth-Azam&#8221; ie of Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee).

					<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s a pitty why the majority of muslims still not adhere to the pure Islamic techings  (QUR&#039;AAN AND SAHEEH AHADEETH) and indulge themselves in blind following (taqleed and worshiping personalities)!.Surah Yusaf: 12:106&#039; And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him [i.e. they are Mushrikun -polytheists - see Verse 6: 121]. Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember.
surah aaraf 7:3. When it is said to them: &quot;Follow what Allah has sent down.&quot; They say: &quot;Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following.&quot; (Would they do that!) Even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided? surah Al baqarah 2:170. O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) and render not vain your deeds. surah Muhammad 47:33. And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah&#039;s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islamic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.surah aale imran 3:103. Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin. sura Annisa 4:48. Verily! Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom he pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away. 4:116. And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah, while he is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers) folk. surah as saff 61:7.On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will say: &quot;Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger (Muhammad SAW).&quot; surah al ahzab 33:66. i think the above aayat are enough to wake us up from the sleep of ignorance and repent and ask Allah subhanahu wa t&#039;aala to forgive and guide us on the straight path of Islamic Monotheism(TOWHEED AND SUNNAH) Aameen.as the Prophet Muhammad Rasulullah (SallAllahu t&#039;aala alaihe wa sallam said: i leave you on 2 things(amrain) i.e (QURAAN AND THE AUTHENTIC SUNNAH) as long as you adhere to them you will never go astray. (o kama qalan Nabiyyu sallAllah alaihe wa aalehe wa ashabehe wa azwajehe wa zurriyatehe wa ahle baytehe wa ittebaehe wa baraka wa sallam).Aameen ya Rabbalaalameen.]]></description>
