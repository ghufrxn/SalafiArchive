May Allah Subh&#039;nahu wa taa&#039;la Have mercy on his sole and forgive his sins.
Aameen Ya RABB.
Definitively, this is a great loss in Ummah for those who are taking &#038; seeking Qur’an wa-Sunnah in their life based upon the methodology of Salaf-us-Saliheen.
May ALLAH give patience to his family upon this major loss.
Aameen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Inna lillahe wa inna ilayhe raajeon (Verily, we are for Allaah (azza wa jal) and to Him (azza wa jal) is the (our) return)

We pray to Allaah (azza wajal) that may He give patience and endurance to the family, students of qur&#039;an wa sunnah of shaykhana (rahimahullah) on this major loss in their family, ameen. As i myself and students of knowledge do consider the shaykh (rahimahullah) as our spiritual father.

Shaykh Haafidh, Zubair ali zay (rahimahullah) was the noblest muhadith after shaykh albaani (rahimahullah). We pray to Allaah (azza wa jal) that may Allaah (azza wajal) pardon and forgive the mistakes of shaykhana (rahimahullah) and may his books and works and statements and speeches of shaykh zubair (rahimahullah) would always be read and studied and bring more and more reward for shaykhana (rahimahullah) and give him (rahimahullah) the noblest place in jannah al-fardous, ameen.

Indeed we should pray to Allaah (azza wa jal) that He (azza wa jal) may take care of our deen and bring more such muhaditheen amongst us who take and honour the flag of Qur&#039;an wa-sunnah upon the methodology of salaf-as-saliheen on based on sahee wa hasan isnaad with what jamhoor has said and did, ameen wa thumma ameen ya rab.]]></description>
