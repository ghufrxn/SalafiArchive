					<description><![CDATA[But Muhammad Zahid Kawthari and his followers ( Faraz Rabbani , Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed , Abu Layth , Faqir ) don&#039;t seem to agree with all those scholars you have listed above. I am sort of confused, these dubious followers of Zahid al-Kawthari and al-Kawthari himself claims to do Taqlid of Madhhab then why don&#039;t they follow their scholars ? These people are the real fitnah mongers. May Allah save us from them.


Below is an example of how these so called traditional scholars with full Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed type ijazas have distorted:



Is it permissible to build structures on graves? 
Answered by Shaykh Amjad Rasheed 
Translated by Sidi Moustafa Elqabbany 


Summary: The Shafi`i point of view is that there is a difference of 
opinion among the Shafi`i scholars

Is it permissible to build on graves? 
Answered by Shaykh Amjad Rasheed 
Translated by Shaykh Hamza Karamali, SunniPath Academy Teacher 
 

Summary: Follow up to previous the response linked to above. 
Summarizes that the relied-upon position in the Shafi`i school is that 
building a building over a grave in a public cemetery is unlawful, 
because it blocks others from burying someone else in that area. 
However, building a building over a grave in a privately-owned area is 
offensive but not unlawful. 
--- 

How can you say that building on graves is permitted? 
Answered by Shaykh Faraz Rabbani 


Summary: Shaykh Faraz Rabbani explains that it is an established 
position in the Hanafi madhhab that building a building over a grave 
is permissible, though that is not the majority position. The majority 
position of the scholars in the Hanafi madhhab is that it is not 
permissible.

Abd al-Ghani al-Nablusi 
by Ustadha Umm Sahl 
In the following article, see the third section, &quot;Domes over the Grave 
of the Awilya and Knowledge from the Preserved Tablet&quot; 


Summary: According to the Hanafi madhhab, as well as the majority of 
scholars, it is makruh (disliked), but not haram (prohibited), to 
build a building over a grave.

The above are just to show the readers how these Asharites and Maturidis have done tahreef.]]></description>
