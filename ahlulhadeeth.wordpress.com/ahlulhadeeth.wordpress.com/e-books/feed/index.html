Assalaamu Alaikum!

To simply give away books that inspire and nourish, crackling parched, hearts and minds of children and their loving families.

					<description><![CDATA[I have no words to aptly describe  my emotions of simultaneous awe,respect, gratitude, humility and relief after having lost all hope of ever finding the answers to the depraved, elusively complicated yet cunningly crafted explanations of the soofies. I had almost no sleep the past few days searching the web  for the truth. And here at last, I rejoice. I feel too small and insignificant to even try to thank you all as the amount of hard work and diligent perseverance you do must be humugous. I can only say that my family and I shall pray to Almighty Allaah T&#039;Aalaa for your your continued success in both lives.]]></description>
