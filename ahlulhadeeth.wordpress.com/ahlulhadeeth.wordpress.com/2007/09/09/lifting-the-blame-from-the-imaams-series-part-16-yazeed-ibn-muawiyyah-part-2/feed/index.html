					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/lifting-the-blame-from-the-imaams-series-part-16-yazeed-ibn-muawiyyah-part-2/#comment-314&quot;&gt;Hammad Raza&lt;/a&gt;.

Firstly How are these scholars proving The Prophets family were wrong

Secondly what did yazid actually do or say that&#039;s authentically proven from him instead of just following the bandwagon

Thirdly the shee&#039;ah themselves martyred Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)

Fourthly Why did Hussains brother, the son of Alee Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah (May Allaah be pleased with them all) say the sheea&#039;ahs killed my family

Fifthly Why did Muslim Ibn Aqeel, a member of the household send a message back to Hussain from Koofah informing him of the treacherous and deceptive promise of the Shee&#039;ahs.

And the list can continue, be open beyond bigotry and staunchness and look at these issues with an open mind and blame the people who were actually responsible instead of shifting blame.]]></description>
