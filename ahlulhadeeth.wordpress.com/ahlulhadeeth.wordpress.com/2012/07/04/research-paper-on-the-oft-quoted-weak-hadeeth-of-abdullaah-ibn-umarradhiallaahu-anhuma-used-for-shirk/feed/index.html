					<description><![CDATA[Salaam Alaikum. I just want to say that regardless of the Hadeeth being weak this hadeeth can easily be summed up in the following. Even if this hadeeth was Authentic it would still not make a difference because all this is, is an issue of Lugha. Take a look at the narration : The foot of Ibn Umar went numb, so a man said to him mention the name of the person that is most beloved to you from amongst the people, so he said, “Yaa Muhammad.”

All the hadeeth is saying is that he remebered Nabi (saw) and he became better. Now in Our asian cultures, specificaly Pakistani, how many times have we heard our elder say Oh My mother, Ai Meree Maa, the whole point is that they saying this is what they say when they want to remember a time when they were in ease. So the narration is merely saying that Ibn Umar remembered the times of Rasool (saW) when they were strong and because of this it gave his a sort of push and he felt better. All this is Lugha, very simple but true explanation. Most people just show how the hadeeth is weak, which is perfectly fine, but just look more carefully at the narration, no where is it mentioned that he said Ya rASOOL HEAL ME OR HEAL MY FOOT.]]></description>
