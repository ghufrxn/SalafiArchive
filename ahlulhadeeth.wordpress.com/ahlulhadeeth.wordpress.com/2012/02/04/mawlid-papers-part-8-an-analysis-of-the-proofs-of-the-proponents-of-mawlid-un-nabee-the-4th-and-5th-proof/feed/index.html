					<description><![CDATA[&quot;....The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) fasted on the day of Ashoora but nothing has been cited from him concerning his own birthday...&quot;
assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu

jazak Allahu khairan akhi, barak Allahu feek! 

I just wanted to bring to your attention, in sha Allah, the above quote, I believe there is a hadith in which a man asks the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam why he fasts on Mondays. To which the Messenger of Allah sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam mentions it is because he was born on Monday and the Quran was revealed on that day (Monday) 

My sincere apologies as I do not have the hadith reference at hand. I&#039;m pretty sure it is authentic though.

However, may Allah bless you, this doesn&#039;t take away from the rest of the answer rather it strengthens the overall argument of not celebrating the birth date, walhamdulillah.

May Allah accept this effort of your in the scales of good and make it heavy for you, aameen,]]></description>
