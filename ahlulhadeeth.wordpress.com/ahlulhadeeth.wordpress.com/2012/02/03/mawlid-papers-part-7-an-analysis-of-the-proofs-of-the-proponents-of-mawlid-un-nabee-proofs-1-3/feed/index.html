Wa Barakallahu Feek, inshaAllah the book maybe provided in PDF or printed format. No Prophetic is fine inshaAllaah and this is what we intended meaning the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu Alayhee Wasallams) way. 

JazakAllahu Khaira for your beneficial feedback.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jazakallahu khayra for the articles. I hope you will provide the book in pdf format too.
