					<description><![CDATA[Allah Hu Akbar!! May Allaah reward u for smashing the nonsense propagated by ahlul bidah into smithereens. 

however, could you please provide the link of the video where asrar rashid calls himself a dog? 

Its astounding how these barelwis can dare mock the beloved scholars of Ahlus Sunnah such as Uthaymeen, Bin Baz and Albaani etc (May Allah have mercy on them) yet they think they can hide behind their so-called lion asrar who has been speared by the brothers of this website! PURE OWNAGE!!]]></description>
