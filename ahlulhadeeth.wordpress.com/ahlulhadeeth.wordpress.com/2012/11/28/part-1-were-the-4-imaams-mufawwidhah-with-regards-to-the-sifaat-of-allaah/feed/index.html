					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/part-1-were-the-4-imaams-mufawwidhah-with-regards-to-the-sifaat-of-allaah/#comment-630&quot;&gt;dawud&lt;/a&gt;.

Actually this is a lie - when Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta&#039;Aaalaa Himself explained His Tawheed in Surah Fatiha in 3 categories and many early scholars of the Salaf explained it in this way too:
Imam al-’Ukb’ari [may Allah have mercy upon him] died 387 A.H wrote, “Thus, the foundations of faith in Allah which are an obligation upon the creation to firmly believe in establishing faith in him are three:

1. That the slave believes in the Lordship of Allah

2. That he believes in Allah’s oneness [in worship]

3. That he affirms that He is described by attributes which only He could be described with such as The All Knowing, The Allah powerful, The All-Wise and the other attributes which He described Himself with.

Imam Tahawi said in the introduction to his aqeedah: “Indeed Allah is the One Unique. There is no partner with Him and there is nothing like Him and nothing can overpower Him.”  Which is the 3 categories clearly]]></description>
