					<description><![CDATA[salamu a3laykum brother in islaam, 

Ma sha Allaah what you are doing is great work and may Allaah azza wa jal do reward you in your work, ameen. Just i wanted to say suppose in this above reference you said &quot;(Fataawa Ridhwiyyah of Ahmad Raza (4/7)&quot; wouldn&#039;t it be better if you do tell if its volume 4 and page 7 or page 7 with volume 4. if you write it completely it would be very beneficial for reader like us. Also brother, it would be more authentic if you give the publisher name with them too with it, Because often mubtada3een may bring same fataawa of another publisher and on that volume and page may or may not be written. This is not only about mubtada3een but also about other references that you bring from great muhaditheen. It wouild be great benefit for us, In sha Allaah.

Other than that ma sha Allaah your team is doing great work translating the work of shayyukh like shaykh abu taahir zubair ali zai (hafidhahullah).
