					<description><![CDATA[Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad &#038; Co are  high caliber jokers , so far all what they did is nothing but made other laugh on their scholarship.
 
They will bring so many unrelated names like zarqani, qastallani and it is not far-fetched  if you see their Dr. Shaykh al-islam Tahir al-Qadri and Mawlana Ahmad Reza Khan Barelwi to be quoted by them to support their stance.

I wonder where is their propaganda PR specialist mr faqir ? under which nick is he posting apart from faqir ?

I saw these people are not even Hanafis, they only hide behind hanafi madhhab to fool unsuspecting innoncent muslims in UK ; These people are different kind , a kind similar to Bishr al-Hanafi and not similar to Tahawi al-Hanafi.]]></description>
