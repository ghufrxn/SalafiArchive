<div class='sidebar'>Belief in the  Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> is from the six pillars of the belief of a Muslim and it impacts <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in a profound way. This is because the issues connected to <a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a> penetrate into almost every aspect of the religion. There is the statement reported from Ibn Abbaas (radiallaahu anhu), "<i>al-Qadr is the nidhaam (arrangement, order) of Tawheed</i>", and <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) said, "<i>And this (pertaining to wisdom in Allaah's actions) is from the most loftiest of the matters of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>  connected to the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, and the command, and the legislation and the decree</i>." (Minhaj al-Sunnah 3/39).  For this reason, it is vital that this serious topic is not spoken of with shallow answers, or words that invalidate al-Qadr itself. A fatwa was given recently by a person named <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> - a speaker who is regularly hosted by Green Lane Mosque in Birmingham, UK - in which he makes affirmation that <u>it is correct</u> to say unrestrictedly that the "Divine Qadar" is "created" - a very irresponsible and shallow response to a serious question about a lofty matter. We write this article out of advice to this brother, to make sure no one is confused by this statement and to establish the truth of the matter, and to protect the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah from tahreef (distortion), whether intentional or otherwise.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Clarification of the Statement of <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> That Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> Was Created</font>    <P>
On his website, the following question and answer appears:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/divine-qadr-created.gif width=533 border=0>    <P>
Here is <a href=assets/images/divine-qadr-created-screen.gif>an actual screenshot of the fatwa</a> given by <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Comments and Observations</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> It is not permissible to give shallow and dangerous answers to great and serious affairs of the religion. It is not permissible for a person to put himself forward as a muftee for the Muslims at large when he is clearly not qualified (as indicated by such a shallow answer) and unable to present and articulate an answer that is clear, unambiguous, makes tafseel (detail) and fulfils the need of the questioner.     <P>
<b>TWO:</b> Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) said in  al-Majmoo' (8/410,413):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The word <i><a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a></i>, can be intended (to mean) <i>al-taqdeer</i> (Allaah's act of determining affairs) or <i>al-muqaddar</i> (that which has been determined). So if you intend that the actions of the servants are the very same as the <i>taqdeer</i> of Allaah which is His knowledge (<i>ilm</i>) and His speech (<i>kalaam</i>) and His will (<i>mashi'ah</i>) and the likes of this from His attributes, then this is an error and falsehood. For the actions of the servants are not from the attributes of Allaah, the Exalted at all. And if you meant that they are decreed (<i>muqaddarah</i>), Allaah the Exalted determined them, then this is the truth... [a little later, refuting the Hulooliyyah] ... it is said to him: His command (amr) and His <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> which is His attribute (sifah), <u>such as His will and His speech, is uncreated</u>. But as for His command (amr) which is the matter decreed, then it is created. Hence, the maqdoor is created, and that which is commanded (ma'moor bihi) is created, even if they are labelled "amr" and "qadar." </blockquote>    <P>
The word <a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a> is one of those such words (just like al-amr, al-khalq etc.) which can be used in one of two ways, one that refers to the actual act or one that refers to the actual entity resulting from the act - thus <i>khalq</i> (<a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>) can refer to Allah's act of creating or it can refer to the entity of the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> that has been created, and <i>amr</i> (command) can refer to Allaah's command (which entails His actual speech, <i>kalaam</i>) or the actual command itself (such as praying for example, which is commanded). Likewise for <i><a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a></i>. Once this is understood, the question posed to <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> was "<i>Is it OK to say that  qadr/divine <a href='tags/predestination.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Predestination</font></a> <u>was</u> created</i>," and so it is clear that "<i>divine predestination</i>" here followed by "<i>was</i>" would make the reader think that we are speaking of the attributes of Allah, the Sublime and Exalted, and likewise His act.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> <b><u>Without such a clarification therefore</u></b>, the ambiguous affirmation that the "<u><a href='tags/divine-decree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Divine Decree</font></a></u>" "<u>was</u>" created is falsehood and comprises <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> (<a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a>) since the <a href='tags/divine-decree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Divine Decree</font></a> includes the <u>knowledge</u> (<i>ilm</i>), the <u>will</u> (<i>mashee'ah</i>) of Allaah, the Mighty and Exalted, and likewise the <u>speech</u> (<i>kalaam</i>) of Allaah, and also Allaah's <u>act</u> of creating and bringing into existence entities and their actions. As for the writing (<i>kitaabah</i>) which is the writing of the pen (<i>qalam</i>) into the tablet (<i>lawh</i>), then that is created, as Allaah created the pen and then ordered it to write and so it wrote into the preserved tablet, so the actual writing is created (meaning the Preserved Tablet is a created entity), though Allah's order and command for the Pen to write is not created. As for the other three levels of <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> which are knowledge, will and creating (and which also include <u>speech</u>, <i>kalaam</i>), then it is a repugnant error to imply by such a shallow answer that they are created. The statement that the <a href='tags/divine-decree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Divine Decree</font></a> was "created" therefore, is an extremely dangerous statement because the <a href='tags/divine-decree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Divine Decree</font></a> refers to many things, <b>it refers to Allaah's attributes and it refers to His actions</b>. The knowledge of Allaah is His <u>attribute</u>. The mashee'ah, or iraadah (will, wish) and <i>kalaam</i> (speech) of Allaah are His <u>attributes</u>. Allaah creating (khalq), creating is His <u>action</u>. Hence, to imply that all of this is created is <i>baatil</i> (falsehood), this is very dangerous, it is a statement that comprises <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, because it means Allaah's attribute of knowledge and will and speech and His action (of creating, khalq and bringing into existence, eejaad) are created.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> So when this statement implies that Allaah's attributes and His actions are created, then this brings us to close to the sayings of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who explain away His attributes as being other than Him, meaning His attributes are in reality just manifestations of attributes in created things. So hence, when it is said Allaah's power, it merely refers to the power Allaah put in created things, but it is said to be His power metaphorically, not that there is an attribute for Allaah's essence called "power," just like it is said, "Allaah's Messenger" or "Allaah's House," these are created things but which are ascribed to Allaah, but they are not attributes of Allaah, so this is how the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> explained away the attributes mentioned for Allaah in the revealed texts. So this statement made by <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> in the context of answering this question, <b>it's implications are that some of the attributes of Allaah are created and His actions are created</b>, and this is huge and repugnant error, because in giving a simple three-letter word answer (by saying "yes") to a very serious question, something of the belief of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> is implied.    <P>
<b>FIVE:</b> Al-Ghazali, Imaam of the Ash'ari Jahmites, made a statement, "<i>Nothing exists except Allaah and His actions</i>" and what he really means by this is that nothing exists except Allaah and <u>His creation</u>, when he says, "actions", he does not mean Allaah's actions, as in actual actions ascribed to Allaah, rather, he means by "actions', the actual created entities. <b>So on the surface, this statement appears to be correct, but what it really means is that Allaah has no actions tied to His will and power and ascribed to His essence through which entities are created by Him and brought into existence</b>. They are operating upon the same principle of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that we just highlighted in the previous point, but the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> use this principle (<i>Allaah's attributes are other than Him</i>) to deny all His attributes, whereas the Ash'aris borrowed this principle from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and used it to say essentially that <i>Allah's actions are other than Him</i> to deny that Allaah has actions tied to His will and power, and has actions which are ascribed to His essence, because they believe that this entails ascribing "<i>hawaadith</i>" (events) to Allaah's essence, which would make him just like all other created bodies. So they speak of a principle (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1604; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1601;&#1593;&#1608;&#1604; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1604;&#1602; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602;</span>), "<i>The act is but the thing brought about and the act of creating is but the created entity itself</i>" - this essentially means that instead of having <u>a)</u> a creator, then <u>b)</u> an action performed by the creator and ascribed to His essence, and then <u>c)</u> the resultant created thing (i.e. three things) we only actually have two, so we make the act of creating and resultant created thing [b) and c)] into one which is just the resultant created thing, and in this way, we have eliminated the act in the middle. This is what the As'haris do and this is a way to deny Allaah has actions by using the principle of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to deny the actions. They have made Allaah's actions to be synonymous with the actual created things, just like the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> made the attributes of Allaah to be synonymous with those same attributes manifested in created things without there being actual attributes for Allaah's essence. Hence, when <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> says that it is correct to say that <b>the Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> was created</b>, and from the Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> is the action of Allaah of khalq and eejaad (creating entities, and bringing them and their actions into existence), then this means Allaah's actions are created - and the only refuge one has in order to provide an explanation for this to avoid its apparent <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> is the saying of the Ash'aris which is something more obscure, which is that Allaah's actions are not real actions but just a symbolic way of referring to His <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, meaning essentially that His actions are His <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> - as was intended by al-Ghazali in support of the Ash'ari Jahmee <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of denying Allaah has actions tied to His will and power. So we can now also add the <a href='tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> of the Ash'ariyyah into the list - and this shows that when one does not take care in speaking about these serious issues and the words one uses, it can have serious implications, and necessitate such falsehood that the person speaking (answering) may not realize.    <P>
<b>SIX:</b> Since the Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> also comprises the attribute of the speech of Allaah (<i>kalaam</i>), since it is by His speech that Allaah creates, since He commands through His speech on account of which the previously determined Divine <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a> is brought into existence, then we also have the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> that the speech of Allaah is created, and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from the speech of Allaah, and therefore the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. Now these are all <u>implications</u> of the answer given by <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> - we are not accusing him of these statements - but we are indicating that when a person does not really give due consideration to great and serious matters of the religion, then he will speak haphazardly and with such shallowness that can lead to confusing other people and expressing statements the realities and implications of which he does not grasp and which can put other people to trial and confusion in their deen.    <P>
<b>SEVEN:</b> In light of the above, this brother needs to make a clarification and to correct this <b>blameworthy conduct</b> of giving <u>shallow, erroneous answers</u> in relation to great and mighty affairs, which in turn (as in this instance) may imply beliefs of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> and also enter into the realm of some of the innovated concepts of the Ahl al-Kalaam from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah. For the sake of clarification, it is not being asserted that <a href='tags/assim-al-hakeem.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Assim al-Hakeem</font></a> believes that Allaah's attributes or actions are created, but only that he has given a shallow and repugnant answer to a great and mighty topic, which can imply beliefs of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>. Essentially, this man is not qualified to answer in such matters, and should resign himself to the Scholars, the people of knowledge and not put the people to trial by presenting himself <u>as an independent muftee</u> through his website as clearly appears to be the case. We ask Allaah for pardon and safety in speech and action.    <P>
