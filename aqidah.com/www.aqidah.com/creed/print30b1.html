The Shaykh, Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir as-Sa`dee (rahimahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...And as for <u>the action of the servant</u>, which [consists of actions of] obedience and disobedience, then it is obligatory to <b>be pleased with the [actions of] obedience</b> that occur from him and from others besides him, and to love them, and <b>to hate the [actions of] disobedience</b> that occur from him and from others besides him. So pleasure and hate in these two types both return back to the action of the servant, and this [in turn] returns back to the agreement of the Lord [in either] His love for the [actions of] obedience, or His hate [for the actions] of disobedience, and his separating between them both in the rulings of the world and the hereafter. So it is upon us to agree with Allaah regarding that.     <P>
And as for the angle of <u>the taqdeer of Allaah</u> of them (those actions of obedience or disobedience), and the action of the Lord (i.e. al-qadaa wal-qadr) from which they emanated, then <b>it is upon us to be pleased with them from this angle</b>, being in agreement with our Lord in that, for He ordained the good and evil and He loved the good and hated the evil that occurs from the servants.     <P>
So by this detail, the difficulty ceases in this great matter which requires a practical criterion. And whoever did not differentiate with this differentiation, he will fall into various types of error and (aspects of) ignorance.</blockquote>    <P>
