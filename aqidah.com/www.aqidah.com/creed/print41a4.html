<div class="articleContent">
<p>He is: <b>Abu Ibraaheem, Ismaa'eel bin Yahyaa, bin Ismaa'eel bin Amr bin Muslim al-Muzanee al-Misree</b>    <P>
He is the most prominent student of <u>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee</u>. His other Shaykhs are <u>Nu'aym bin Hammaad</u>, <u>Alee bin Ma'bad bin Shaddaad al-Basre</u>e, and <u>Asbagh bin Naafi'</u>. The small number of his Shaykhs is explained by the fact that he kept very close attachment to his Shaykh, ash-Shaafi'ee, and he did not travel a great deal to the various lands of <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, but sufficed himself with the Shaykhs of Egypt (Misr).    <P>
Abu Ishaaq ash-Sheeraazee said (as-Siyar of adh-Dhahabi 12/493):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I saw al-Muzanee and I have not seen anyone of greater worship of Allaah than him, and nor more precise in fiqh than him.</blockquote>    <P>
Adh-Dhahabi said (as-Siyar 12/492):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Imaam, the Allaamah, the jurist of the Ummah, the signpost of the ascetics.</blockquote>    <P>
And al-Bayhaqi mentions the saying of ash-Shaafi'ee (Manaaqib ash-Shaafi'ee 2/356):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>If this one - pointing at al-Muzanee - debated with the Shaytaan, he would have cut him off (in argument)</blockquote>    <P>
His students include:    <P>
<ul><li>Abu Bakr bin Khuzaimah (d. 311H),   <li>Abu Ja'far at-Tahawi (d. 321),   <li>Zakariyyaa bin Yahyaa as-Saajee (d. 307H),   <li>Abul-Hasan bin Jawsaa (d. 320H),   <li>Abu Muhammad bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Haatim ar-Raazee (d. 327)</ul>    <P>
He was born in 175H, the year in which al-Layth bin Sa'd died, and he died in 264H. <P>
