<font class='titleHeadline'>The Preservation and Transmission of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> by the Salaf</font>    <P>
The last of the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> lived until the end of the first century, with <b>Anas bin Malik</b> (d. 93H) and <b>Abu Tufayl Amir bin Wathilah</b> (d. 110H) being from the last of <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> to pass away. During this time the Taabi'een (those born after the Prophet and who took knowledge from the Companions) inherited the knowledge from the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> in the issue of belief (<i><a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a></i>, <i><a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a></i>), <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence), <i>hadeeth</i>, <i>tafseer</i> (exegesis of the Qur'an) and they also witnessed the position taken by the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> towards the  sects of the <u>Khawaarij</u>, <u>Raafidah</u>, <u><a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a></u>. They would acquire and narrate knowledge from the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>, seeking the hadeeth of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) and the knowledge of the deen upon the understanding and explanation of the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>.     <P>
From the prominent amongst this generation of Taabi'een include:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Shurayh al-Qaadee (d. 80H), Abu al-Aaliyah (d. 90H), Sa'eed bin al-Musayyab (d. 93H), Ibraaheem an-Nakha'ee (d. 95H),  Umar bin Abdil-Azeez (d. 101H), ash-Sha'bee (d. 103H), Mujaahid (d. 104H), Qataadah (d. 104H), Abu Qilaabah (d. 104H), Tawus (d. 106H), Ibn Shawdhab (d. 107H), al-Hasan al-Basree (d. 110H), Muhammad Ibn Seereen (d. 110H).</b></div>    <P>
It was during this time that the Taabi'een learned the care that began to be taken in accepting and transmitting knowledge. This was because of the tribulations that occurred from the major sects of innovation that appeared, at the head of them the Khawaarij, after the murder of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu), and the removal of trustworthiness and the spread of lying, and seeking of narrations out of support for the innovated sayings (of the Khawarij, Raafidah, <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a> and Murji'ah), and so on. And it is here we understand the sayings of some of the likes of Ibn 'Abbaas and the prominent taabi'een.    <P>
Muslim brings in his Saheeh that Bushayr al-Adawee came to Ibn Abbaas and began to narrate to him, and he did not give permission for that, and when Bushayr enquired as to why, Ibn Abbaas said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When we used to hear a man say: '<i>The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said</i>..', our eyes hastened to him, and we turned our ears to him. But when the people traversed difficulty and humiliation, we did not take from the people except what we already knew (from the Prophet).</blockquote>    <P>
There is the famous statement of Muhammad bin Seereen (d. 110H), brought by Imaam Muslim in the introduction to his Saheeh compilation:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right'>&#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606;&#1608;&#1575; &#1610;&#1587;&#1571;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1593;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1606;&#1575;&#1583; &#1601;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575; &#1608;&#1602;&#1593;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1578;&#1606;&#1577; &#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575; : &#1587;&#1605;&#1608;&#1575; &#1604;&#1606;&#1575; &#1585;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1605; &#1548; &#1601;&#1610;&#1615;&#1606;&#1618;&#1592;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1571;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610;&#1615;&#1572;&#1618;&#1582;&#1584; &#1581;&#1583;&#1610;&#1579;&#1615;&#1607;&#1605; &#1548; &#1608;&#1610;&#1615;&#1606;&#1618;&#1592;&#1614;&#1585; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1571;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1601;&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1572;&#1582;&#1584; &#1581;&#1583;&#1610;&#1579;&#1607;&#1605;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They never used to ask about the isnaad (chain of narration). Then when the fitnah occurred, they said: Name us your men (i.e. narrators). Then it would be look towards Ahl us-Sunnah and their hadeeth would be taken. And it would be look at towards Ahl ul-Bid'ah and their hadeeth would not be taken.</blockquote>    <P>
And ad-Daarimee brings in his Sunan, the saying of Abu al-Aaliyah:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right'>&#1603;&#1606;&#1575; &#1606;&#1587;&#1605;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1608;&#1575;&#1610;&#1577; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1589;&#1585;&#1577; &#1593;&#1606; &#1571;&#1589;&#1581;&#1575;&#1576; &#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; - &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; - &#1601;&#1604;&#1605; &#1606;&#1585;&#1590; &#1581;&#1578;&#1609; &#1585;&#1603;&#1576;&#1606;&#1575; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606;&#1577; &#1601;&#1587;&#1605;&#1593;&#1606;&#1575;&#1607;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606; &#1571;&#1601;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607;&#1607;&#1605;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We used to hear a narration in Basrah (being narrated) from the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and we were not satisfied until we travelled to Madinah and heard it from their mouths (directly).</blockquote>    <P>
So in this period, care was taken in accepting narrations and transmitting narrations.    <P>
It was also in this period (the turn of the century) that the heads of innovation, al-Ja'd bin Dirham (ex. 124H), al-Jahm bin Safwaan (ex. 128H), Waasil bin Ataa (d. 131H), and Amr bin Ubayd (d. 144H) were present, and they were the founders of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u> and <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u> respectively, who adopted some of the usool of the <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> (Khawaarij, <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a>, Murji'ah) and adding their own <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, increasing the tribulation.     <P>
When these factions emerged, it was the Taabi'een, who having inherited that knowledge from the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>, safeguarded the truth, preserved it, transmitted it, and spoke against these heads of innovation.    <P>
So amongst them in this era:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Az-Zuhree (d. 124H), Ayub as-Sakhtiyaanee (d. 131H), Zayd bin Aslam (d. 136H), Rabee'ah (d. 136H), Yunus bin Ubayd (d. 139H), al-A'mash (d. 148H), Abu Haneefah (d. 150H), Abdullah ibn Awn (d. 151H), al-Awzaa'ee (d. 157H), Shu'bah ibn al-Hajjaaj (d. 160H), Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d. 167H), Hammaad bin Salamah (d. 167H), Al-Layth bin Sa'd (d. 175H), Shareek bin Abdullaah (d. 177H), Imaam Maalik (d. 179H), Hammaad bin Zayd (d. 179H), Abdullaah bin al-Mubaarak (d. 181H), Fudayl bin Iyaad (187H), Sufyan bin Uyainah (d. 197H), Wakee' ibn al-Jarraah (d. 197H), Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee (d. 198H), Yahyaa ibn Sa'eed al-Qattaan (198H).</b></div>    <P>
And these Scholars and Imaams of the Muslims spoke against the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the various sects. They transmitted the Prophetic Sunnah and they  preserved the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> from the various falsehoods.    <P>
Then came the third century and from the great Imaams and Scholars of the Sunnah were:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee (d. 204H), Abdur-Razzaaq as-San'aanee (d. 211H), <a href='tags/al-humaydee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Humaydee</font></a> (d. 220H), Abu Ubaid al-Qaasim bin Sallaam (d. 224H), Nu'aym bin Hammaad (d. 228H), Yahyaa bin Ma'een (d. 233H), Ali bin al-Madeenee (d. 234H), Abu Khaythamah (d. 234H), Ibn Abee Shaybah (d. 235), Ishaaq bin Raahooyah (d. 238), Qutaybah bin Sa'eed (d. 240H), Abu Thawr Ibraaheem bin Khaalid (d. 240H), Imaam <a href='tags/ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a> (d. 241), Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d. 256H), <a href='tags/ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad</font></a> bin Sinaan al-Waasitee (d. 256H), Imaam Muslim (d. 261H), Abu Zur'ah ar-Raazee (d. 264H), al-Muzanee (d. 264H), Abu Bakr bin Athram 9d. 272H), Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d. 274H), Imaam Abu Daawud (d. 275H), Ibn Qutaybah (d. 276H), Abu Haatim ar-Raazee (d. 277H), Imaam ad-Daarimee (d. 280H), Ibn Abee Aasim (d. 287H), Abdullaah bin <a href='tags/ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad</font></a> (d. 290H), al-Marwazee (d. 294H).</b></div>    <P>
These were the great scholars who authored works, compilations of ahaadeeth, refutations and had much speech against the sects of innovation and deviation, and thus they preserved and transmitted the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> in their works, much of which was in the form of preserving the Prophetic Sunnah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>There Will Always Be Scholars Upon the Manifest Truth, the Pure Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and the Upright Deen</font>    <P>
In the time when the erosion and the pollution of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> took place, Allaah, the Most High, mobilized the prominent firmly-grounded Scholars from those who came after the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> to refute the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and deviants and to safeguard and preserve His religion, and indeed the Prophet (alayhis salaam) said in the hadeeth that is reported by both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim in their two Saheehs:    <P>

This group is no doubt the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger, for they are the saved group (<i>al-Firqat un-Naajiyah</i>), as has preceded in the hadeeth previously quoted regarding the splitting of the Ummah, and they are also the aided group (<i>at-Taa'ifat ul-Mansoorah</i>) mentioned in the above hadeeth, and they are also the people of hadeeth (<i>As.haab ul-Hadeeth</i>), and they are the people of the prophetic way and the united body (<i>Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah</i>) - all of these terms are synonymous and <u>in their origin</u>, apply to the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger, and thereafter, their successors, then their successors, then their successors <u>and whoever followed them upon the truth</u>, up until the Day of Judgement.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And it is a promise from Allaah, by way of this hadeeth, that there will never cease to be a group from the Ummah manifestly and clearly upon the truth - and they are the Scholars, the carriers of the Prophetic Hadeeth and Sunnah - and this means that the truth is attainable in every age and era, and that the truth will never perish or become totally obscure. And it is precisely upon this pure truth that all true rectification takes place, that to which Allaah gives His aid, support and success.

<font class='titleHeadline'>Compilation and Authoring of the Books of <a href="tags/aqidah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">aqidah</font></a></font>    <P>
During this period of 300 years after hijrah, there were tremendous efforts by the great Imaams mentioned earlier, especially in the field of authorship, compilation of the Hadeeth, preservation of the Sunnah, corroboration of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and refutation of innovation and falsehood. The following list mentions either the names of books that were authored or those about whom it is documented and recorded that they did author books, but which have been lost or have not reached us.

Further, <u>the compilers of the six books of hadeeth</u>, then none of them were upon the usool of any of the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, rather they were the followers of the Sunnah, and took their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> from what they compiled of the Prophetic Sunnah. They included within their works specific books and chapters in refutation of the groups and sects of innovation, such as the Khawaarij, Raafidah, <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a>, Murji'ah, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and others. These Imaams of Hadeeth were: <u>Imaam al-Bukhaaree</u> (d. 256H), <u>Imaam Muslim</u> (d. 261H), <u>at-Tirmidhee</u> (d. 274H), <u>Abu Dawud</u> (d. 275H), <u>Ibn Maajah</u> (d. 273H) and <u>an-Nasaa'ee</u> (d. 303H).    <P>
And the Imaams of the four schools of fiqh, <u>Abu Haneefah</u> (d. 150H), <u>Imaam Maalik</u> (d. 179H), <u>Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee</u> (d. 204H) and <u><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a></u> (d. 241H) were upon the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf. And likewise the author of the tafseer of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>  by way of the Prophetic ahaadeeth, by the mufassir, <u>Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree</u> (d. 310H) was upon the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>It is important to note that <u>before</u> there was ever known a faction by the label of "<i>Ash'ariyyah</i>" which was right at the end of the fourth and early fifth centuries (i.e. around 400H onwards), the People of the Sunnah, the Imaams of the Salaf, <b>had already refuted and subdued</b> the likes of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and their various deviations in different subjects. What became known as "Ash'ariyyah" was simply <u>the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of Ibn Kullaab (d. 240H)</u> which appeared during the time of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a>, and Ibn Kullaab was reviled and refuted by the likes of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> and his associates because he simply carried on some of the usool of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> as it relates to Allaah's actions (<i>sifaat fi'liyyah</i>) and the issue of the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Further, the later Ash'ari scholars hybridized this early Kullaabi <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> with other deviations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, in particular in thos areas in which they could not find satisfactory rational answers to the arguments of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. So no one should be deceived by the claim that there was a truth other than, or over and above the truth that the People of the Sunnah and the Imaams of the religion were upon <u>in the first 350 years after hijrah</u> which <u>they never knew about</u> and did not call to and did not explain in their books, but which only the "Ash'arites" stumbled upon in the fourth century onwards. This is from the historical frauds used as propaganda to promote doctrines that are in reality derived from the usool of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, concealed under the banner and slogan of "Ash'ariyyah" and "Orthodox Sunni Creed".
