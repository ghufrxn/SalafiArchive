Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding the Books of the <a href="tags/people-of-the-book.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">People of the Book</font></a></font>    <P>
In summary: That what has come in their books - meaning the previous [revealed] books - divides into two types and two things:    <P>
<b>Firstly:</b> That about which Allaah has narrated to us in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, or the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [has narrated to us], then this is accepted, correct.    <P>
<b>And secondly:</b> What they [the people of the book] have narrated, then this does not escape from three situations:    <P>
<ul><li><u>The first situation:</u> That our legislation testifies to its falsity, it is obligatory upon us to hold it as false and to reject it.    <P>
<li><u>The second situation:</u> That whose truthfulness our legislation testifies to, so we accept it as true and accept it due to the witness of our legislation over it.    <P>
<li><u>The third situation:</u> What is neither from this (the first) or that (the second), it is obligatory upon us to withhold, because they do not believe, and [thus] in their report (khabar) there will occur lying, change, addition and decrease.</ul></blockquote>    <P>
