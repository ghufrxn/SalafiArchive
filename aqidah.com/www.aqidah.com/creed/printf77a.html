<div class='sidebar'><b>View: <a href=index9cff.html?oeotc>Part 1</a>, <a href=indexf77a.html?vqlrf>Part 2</a>, <a href=index6693.html?hxnhe>Part 3</a>, <a href=indexcda2.html?flqoi>Part 4</a></b></div>    <P>
Whilst the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> (radiallaahu anhum) were alive and after they passed away (beginning of the 2nd century, after 100H), people of different backgrounds, beliefs and ideas entered into the religion, and they were from the offspring of the Persians, Jews, Christians, and idol-worshippers.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>From these were people who entered the religion with good intentions, and a true desire for <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, so their <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> was good. And amongst them were a people who entered into the religion with an evil intent, and their goal was to corrupt this religion. This faction of people began to spread their poison amongst the ranks of the Muslims from the time they entered into <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, and they had a big role in the great turmoil in the beliefs (aqaa'id) of the Muslims and in corrupting their minds, and entering evils and spreading <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> into the Islamic world.</div>    <P>
Thus, we find that the foundations of the deviant ideas and beliefs which spread amongst the ranks of the Muslims return to the beliefs of the Jews, Christians and the ideas of the Persians and to Greek Philosophy which was brought into the Arabic language through translation.    <P>
From the period of 30H to 100H there emerged the four major sects which are the foundations for the seventy-two sects mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah, and they are the <u>Khawaarij</u>, the <u>Raafidah</u>, the <u><a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a></u> and the <u>Murji'ah</u>.     <P>
From around 100H to 150H some of the major heads of innovation appeared who consolidated numerous <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, and they became callers to misguidance. The two main factions at this stage were the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u> and the <u><a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, and the individuals concerned were <i>al-Ja'd bin Dirham</i> (ex. 124H) and <i>al-Jahm bin Safwaan</i> (ex. 128H) - their followers became known as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. Alongside their own <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, they carried the <a href='tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> of the Murji'ah and propounded exaggeration in <a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a> (the <a href='tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> of <i>al-Jabr</i>).     <P>
At the same time were <i>Waasil bin 'Ataa</i> (d. 131H) and <i>Amr bin Ubayd</i> (d. 144H) and they were the heads of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. They carried the <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> of the <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a> and the Khawaarij and also took <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> pertaining to Allaah's Attributes. So in this period, these figureheads that emerged (and their followers) took some of the original <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, and added their own, especially in the subject of Allaah's Names and Attributes.     <P>
<b>And they (the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in the second century) carried the tribulation into the Ummah for the next 100 or so years into the 3rd century hijrah, with repugnant beliefs that were beliefs of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> and they put the Ummah to trial with them, until the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> had many from the Imaams of the Sunnah killed in the fitnah of the (belief of) the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. </b>    <P>
There was also <i>Muqaatil bin Sulaymaan</i> (d. 150H) who exaggerated in affirming Allaah's Attributes until he fell into something of resemblance of Allaah with the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>We should understand as well that the earlier to the time of Prophethood, the lighter the <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> and the more distant from the time of the Prophethood, the greater and more serious the <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>. Thus the first <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> of the Khawaarij and the Raafidah pertained to the issues of the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> and the notions of political and social justice, and the impact major sins upon <i><a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a></i> (<a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>). Then the innovation of the <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a> pertained to the <a href='tags/divine-decree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Divine Decree</font></a>, and that of the Murji'ah pertained to <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> (<a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>) and its reality.  At this point, there was nothing relating directly to Allaah Himself, His Essence and His Attributes, until the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> emerged. From their <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a> were the denial of Allaah's Names and Attributes, the claim that He is everywhere, the denial that He is above His Throne, above the seven heavens, the claim that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (the Speech of Allaah) is created and other related affairs. Then there appeared the esoteric (baatiniyy) Sufi mysticism, mixed with philosophy as a result of which the doctrines of <i>wahdat ul-wujood</i> and <i>al-ittihaad</i> (Allaah and the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> are a single entity) and al-hulool (Allaah indwells in the creation) and the abolition of the Sharee'ah for those with intellects who - as they claim - can reach and grasp such so-called higher truths, and thus are beyond religion, and so they eroded the Sharee'ah of <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>.</div>     <P>
Then in the third century appeared the offshoots of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who are the <u><a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a></u>, the <u>Karraamiyyah</u>, the <u>Ash'ariyyah</u> and the <u>Maturidiyyah</u> and all of these are known collectively as "<b>Mutakallimoon</b>", the Theologians. They were all united in using a rational  proof first pioneered by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in proving the universe is created and therefore has a creator called "<i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i>" or "<i>hudooth al-a'raad fil-ajsaam</i>", which argues that the presence of qualities (<a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat</font></a>), incidental, non-permanent attributes (a'raad) and events, occurrences (hawaadith) that reside in or arise from bodies (i.e. all that is in the universe) constitutes evidence of the created nature of the bodies within which they reside or arise from, that these bodies themselves are "<i>hawaadith</i>" (things that came to be after not being). And since it is impossible for there to be no beginning-less events (as this would go on to infinity in the past), there must a creator behind them, who brought them into existence.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This rational proof is the basis upon which they build their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and it is not fundamentally based upon the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah, and the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of the <a href='tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a> as <u>a starting point</u>. This is because they were trying to present <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> to atheist philosophers who only accepted the intellect as a starting point. By getting drawn into this matter with the philosophers, they went astray, and made the intellect to be decisive over the revealed texts as a result of which they began to reject some texts (ahaad hadeeth) that they could find a way to reject, and qualify those that they could not reject (the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and mutawaatir hadeeth) through what their intellects determined to be acceptable or not acceptable (as per their rational proof of "<i>hudooth ul-ajsaam</i>"). These Mutakallimeen then differed with each other <u>as to exactly what can or cannot be affirmed</u> as it relates to <a href='tags/belief-in-allaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>belief in Allaah</font></a>, <u>without invalidating the intellectual proof they are all united upon</u>. And thus their differences are really subsidiary differences <u>after being united upon the foundation</u>. For a thorough and detailed treatment on this subject there are many articles on <a href=http://www.asharis.com/>Asharis.Com</a>, and you can start with <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/series/atomism-and-hudooth-ul-ajsaam-the-core-foundation-of--the-jahmite-ashari-religion.cfm>this series of articles</a>.</div>    <P>
These Mutakallimoon <b>opened a great door of evil for the Ummah</b> in that there emerged those who were carrying the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy and who were trying to bring it to the Muslims, and when they saw the corrupt rational proof that these Mutakallimoon were using to try and defend <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, they pounced upon the situation, because they saw the fundamental flaw in it, and saw it as a means to bolster their argument for the universe being eternal. They then used this to pound further the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So whilst the Mutakallimoon began to deny Allaah's Names (<i>asmaa</i>), Attributes (<i><a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat</font></a></i>) and Actions (<i>af'aal</i>) that came in the revealed texts in order not to invalidate their own rational proof and face defeat from the Philosophers, and began to  make figurative interpretations of them, the Philosophers then just said, "<i>Thank you very much, and we'll do the same with the revealed texts that mention <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> and resurrection, they are all figurative, just like you make the texts of the Attributes to be figurative...</i>" (because they claimed the universe is eternal, that matter is eternal), and another group of the heretical disbelieving, esoteric (baatiniyy) philosophers (Qaraamitah) also came along and said, "<i>Thank you very much, and well do the same with the Sharee'ah rulings, so prayer, fasting hajj and the likes are all figurative too, just like you consider the texts of Attributes to be figurative</i>..."     <P>
And thus did these Mutakallimoon, at the head of them the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and their offshoots who share the same foundation with them, the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, Ash'ariyyah and Maturidiyyah open the door for the assault on the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> by abandoning the Book and the Sunnah and resorting to the aggrandization and raising of their (weak) intellects. It is for this very reason than the Orientalists in their desire to attack the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and to support the Greek philosophical heritage that shapes Western civilization, they are happy to support the Mu'tazili, but in particular the Ash'ari <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> as being representive of orthodox Islamic  <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, because it allows the perpetuation of the doubts of the Philosophers to attack it, which is then seen as the casting of doubt upon Islam in general, and the actual sound Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> in particular - the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, the People of the Hadeeth and Sunnah.</div>    <P>
<b>These <b>Philosophers</b> were the likes of <u>Ya'qub al-Kindi</u> (circa. 252-260H), <u>Abu Nasr al-Farabi</u> (d. 339H) and <u>Ibn Sinaa</u> (d. 429H), and they tried to mould Greek philosophy with Islam, but their real intent was to present the beliefs of the Greek philosophers (which they held to be true) to the Muslims, and they generally held that "religion" is for the common dumb people who need to be given some form of meaning and purpose to their lives (thus the need for religion) and as for absolute truths, and the higher truths, then it is for them (the Philosophers), and thus the Philosophers are more superior to the Prophets, since they Prophets (as they claim) only told the people what they invented and made up in their own minds in order to help the people live moral lives!</b>    <P>
Within this period as well, from the end of the third century hijrah (around 300H onwards), the <u>Esoteric (Baatiniyy)</u> movements appeared and these were the foundations of the Heretical Shi'ites and Sufis, that brough much repugnance, filth and permissiveness over the centuries to follow.    <P>
The diagram below shows the main sects, groups and orientations that emerged in the first five centuries after hijrah.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/aqidah-deviant-sects.gif border=0><BR>  <font style="font-size:11px;"><b>Figure 1:</b> The deviant sects and factions.</font>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Erosion of the Islamic <a href="tags/aqidah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">aqidah</font></a></font>    <P>
With the emergence of all of these sects, individuals and groups, the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> was polluted, and this set the foundations for <u>the permanent splitting of the Ummah</u>, as the Messenger (alayhis salaam) foretold, that the Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all in the Hellfire, except for one, and they are those who remained upon what the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> were upon.    <P>
And the Ummah never lost its strength except due to the erosion and pollution of its <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, since the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is the foundation of <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, and it is from the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> that the actions of one's heart and one's limbs emanate from, and with the corruption in the foundation, there inevitably showed corruption in the branches. And thus the divine law came into operation:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1607;&#1614; &#1604;&#1575;&#1614; &#1610;&#1615;&#1594;&#1614;&#1610;&#1617;&#1616;&#1585;&#1615; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1613; &#1581;&#1614;&#1578;&#1617;&#1614;&#1609; &#1610;&#1615;&#1594;&#1614;&#1610;&#1617;&#1616;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618;&#1601;&#1615;&#1587;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote  class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b>  Verily! Allaah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah). (Ra'd 13:11) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Which is explained in the books of Tafseer that when the people change their condition from one of <i><a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a></i> (<a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>), <i>taqwaa</i> (piety), <i>shukr</i> (gratefulness), <i>taa'ah</i> (obedience) - and these are all affairs that emanate from and are directly tied to the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, since the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is the spring and fountain - then Allaah changes their condition from one of security, safety, strength, honour to one of fear, weakness and dishonour.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Factors Behind the Emergence of Innovation and Deviation</font>    <P>
There were numerous reasons and causes (<a href='tags/asbaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>asbaab</font></a>) and from the main ones were:    <P>
<blockquote>Falling into <b>al-ghuluww (exaggeration)</b> such as what occurred with the Khawaarij and the Raafidah. The Khawaarij exaggerated in the understanding of the revealed texts, and the Raafidah Shi'ah exaggerated in the status of the Companion Alee (radiallaahu anhu) and his offspring.     <P>
Another reason was <b>the refutation of innovation (<a href='tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a>) with another innovation</b>. So the Murji'ah refuted the innovation of the Khawaarij (declaring Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins) with <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>irjaa'</font></a> (claiming actions have no effect on <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, in its increase or decrease), and then the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> appeared trying to take a middle position between the Khawaarij with the Murji'ah and innovating a new saying (a sinful Muslim is neither a Muslim or Kaafir in this life, but is in an "in-between position"). And the Mushabbihah (like Muqaatil bin Sulaymaan) tried to refute the deniers of Allaah's Attributes (the Mu'attilah, such as the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) by exaggerating in their affirmation.  And likewise the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> tried to refute the <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a> (who denied <a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a> giving man complete independent will and power) by exaggerating at the other end and bringing a new innovation of al-jabar, which denies man any independent will and power in his actions.    <P>
Another reason was <b>foreign influences</b>, the Raafidah Shi'ah were started by Abdullah bin Saba', a Yemeni Jew who proclaimed <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> have their roots in Labeed bin al-A'sam, the Jew who poisoned the Messenger (alayhis salaam) - as is documented in the books of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and <a href='tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a>, as well as the Sabean Philosophers. And the <a href='tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/qadariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qadariyyah</font></a> originated with a Christian called Soosan or Sansawaih, which was taken by al-Ma'bad al-Juhanee and then Gheelaan ad-Dimashqee.     <P>
Another reason was <b>making the intellect (aql) decisive over the revealed texts</b> and in particular in the affairs of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and those who gave prominence to this were the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and then the Ash'arites took it from them thereafter. This was upon their claim that the evidence of the intellect is decisive (qat'ee) and as for the revelation, then from it is that which in its authenticity is decisive (i.e. the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the mutawaatir hadeeth), but whose meanings are only qualified by the proof of the intellect which is decisive over them. And as for what is not from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and mutawaatir hadeeth (i.e. the bulk of the Sunnah), then it cannot be accepted as proof in  matters of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> (belief). And they innovated these principles in order to combat the People of the Sunnah and Hadeeth, the carriers and transmitters of the Prophetic heritage of knowledge.    <P>
And another reason was <b>the translation of the books of Greek philosophy into Arabic</b> at the end of the second century (around 180-200H) which the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> incorporated into their polemics and found to be a great treasure to bolster their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and Deviants</font>    <P>
It is for the above reason that you will understand the position taken by the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>, the Taabi'een, those following them, and then the Imaams of the Sunnah and Hadeeth, towards the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and Deviants and you can get a glimpse of that in this article here:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The Innovators:</b> They are More Evil and Harmful Than the Disobedient Sinners - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?aiiyu>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
In the next installment we will look briefly at the main ideas and doctrines that were introduced by the heads of innovation and the various groups and sects, and after that we will be looking at how the Imaams of the Sunnah and Hadeeth stood to preserve and safeguard the truth during the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth centuries after hijrah. This will be in light of certain revealed texts indicative of the fact that the very religion that the <a href='tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> were upon, in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> (belief), ibaadah (worship), manhaj (methodology) and akhlaaq (manners), will be preserved and safeguarded and accessible to Muslims in all ages until the Day of Judgement.    <P>
