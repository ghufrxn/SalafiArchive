<font class='titleHeadline'>I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-manuscript.gif align=right hspace=4 border=0>The Book "I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah" (manuscript copy sample, first page, to the right) is authentically ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, and it has been mentioned by Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) in his book "Aqeedat us-Salaf wa Ashaabil-Hadeeth", and likewise by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in "Jaami al-Uloom wal-Hikam", referring to it as "the risaalah of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> to the people of the mountain." The book has a connected chain of narration to its author and it has been narrated with its chain by Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi in "Dhamm ut-Ta'weel", ad-Dhahabi in "<a href="tags/al-uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Uluww</font></a>", and in "Tadhkirat ul-Huffaadh" and "Siyar". And in his book "al-Arba'een Fee Sifaati Rabbil-Aalameen", adh-Dhahabee says, "And this <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> (al-mu'taqad), we have heard this from him with a saheeh isnaad (authentic chain of narration)" (p. 118). The book also has three hearings (samaa') in the years 574H, 617H, and 667H, the details of which are found in the manuscripts. So the book is firmly established and corroborated as being the work of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>. In these articles we will be quoting from the tahqeeq of Jamaal Azzoon, first edition, 1999, Dar Ibn Hazm.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Brief Note Regarding <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> and the Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Parading Under the Label of "Ash'ariyyah"</font>    <P>
We see these spurious, fraudulent lists of so called "Ash'ari" Scholars being circulated and spread on blogs and websites, with an impressive array of names mentioned therein, and Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee's name is often found in these lists. This is one of the greatest of frauds being perpetrated by the Jahmite Machinery that has taken on the label of "Ash'ariyyah" in the 20th and 21st century. Whilst this is not the place to digress away from the subject of this article, let it be known that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> was a Salafi, Sunni, Athari (all synonymous terms representing only one approach and one aqidah) and his <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> is in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah. He affirmed Allaah's Uluww, with His Essence, affirmed the attributes of Face, Hands, Eyes, and affirms that the Names of Allaah are not created (unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?msfeb>see here</a>), and affirmed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us is uncreated, and opposes the Lafdhiyyah <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (i.e. Ash'ariyyah) who say that al-lafdh al-maqroo' is created (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see here</a>). And he opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah on the subject of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, affirming that it is belief and action, that it increases and decreases. And further he affirms the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, without takyeef or ta'weel or tafweed, on account of it being reported in the authentic narrations. Inshaa'Allaah these details of belief from <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> will be the subject of this series of articles. We demand the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>to abide by the criterion</a> laid out <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>in this article</a> when imputing Ash'ariyyah to any Scholar.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>There is Only One <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, No Matter How It is Found, Recited, Memorized, Heard, Written, and Whoever Says the Pronunciation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created Has Said the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created</font>    <P>
Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-quran.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they {Ahl us-Sunnah] say: The <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech (kalaam) of Allaah, not created. And that [it is as such] no matter how it is conveyed: through recitation of the recitor, through its pronunciation, memorized in the hearts, recited by the tongues, written in the masaahif, [in all cases] it is not created. And whoever spoke with the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of the pronuncation (al-lafdh) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, intending the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> through this, then he has spoken with the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.  </blockquote>    <P>
This is the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf as we have presented in numerous other articles. See the statement of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d. 310H) corroborating the ijmaa' of the Salaf <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?xyfnr >in this article</a>, and it is a powerful statement, may Allaah have mercy upon him.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Ash'ariyyah Jahmiyyah: The Pronounced Recited <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created</font>    <P>
The doctrine of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> which the Salaf declared as "<a href="tags/kufr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">kufr</font></a>"  is taught in all Ash'arite institutions and centers across the world, through the likes of books such as al-Bayjuri's Haashiyah upon Jawharat ut-Tawheed and in which there is explicit mention that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which is al-lafdh al-maqroo' (the recited word) is created, and that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is superior to the recited word (al-lafdh al-maqroo') because he is the best of all <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> (meaning the recited word is created), and repeating that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that is recited is created on at least three occasions - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see this article here</a>, where we find the following three quotes from this standard Ash'arite texbook (p. 161):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjuri-quran-better-or-prophet.gif border=0>    <P>
This translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And is the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with the meaning of the wording that is recited more excellent? Or is our leader, Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [more excellent]. Some of them have held on to what has been reported [that]: "<i>Every letter is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad</i>". However it's [authenticity] is not verified as established. <b>And the truth is that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent because he is more excellent than every created thing (makhlooq)</b>, as is taken from the speech (i.e. commentary) of al-Jalaal al-Mahallee upon the Burdah. And what supports this is that it (the Qur'an) is the action of the reciter and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is more excellent than the reciter and all of his actions. But it is safer to withhold from the likes of this, for the mind being devoid of this does not harm it. End summarized quote from the Haashiyah of the Shaykh, al-Ameer.</blockquote>    <P>
And al-Bayjuri says in another place (p. 162):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth-2.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the outcome (of this discussion) is that every apparent [text] from the Book and the Sunnah that indicates [its] hudooth [meaning "created", to them the Mutakallimoon] then it is to be carried to [be in reference] to <u>the wording [lafdh] that is recited (al-lafdh al-maqroo')</u> and not the kalaam nafsi (meaning residing eternally with Allaah's Self]. However it is prohibited for it to be said, "The Qur'aan is created", <u>except in the situation of teaching</u>, as has been said.</blockquote>    <P>
And a couple of pages eary al-Bayjoori's said (p. 160), leaving no room for any doubt:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bayjoori-quran-makhlooq-hudooth.jpg border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the madhhab of Ahl us-Sunnah is that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, with the meaning of al-Kalaam an-Nafsi [the meaning that resides eternally with the Self of Allaah] is not created. <b>And as for the Qur'aan with the meaning of <u>the lafdh (the wording) that we recite</u>, then it is created</b>. However, it is prohibited that it be said, "The Qur'aan is created" intending by that the wording which we recite - <b>except in the context of teaching</b>. Because it may give the presumption that the Qur'aan, with the meaning of His The Most High's kalaam (i.e. that which resides in the Self) is created. And for this reason, the scholars withheld from speaking with the Qur'aan [being] created.</blockquote>    <P>
In all of these quotes you can clearly see that to the Ash'arites <u>it is that which is maqroo' (what is recited) that is created</u>. And this is none other than the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Lafdhiyyah and you can learn about this species in our article:    <P>
<ul><li>The Six Stages In The <a href='tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> Of the Doctrines of the 'Qur'an Creationists' - The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?fsffi>read article here</a>. </ul>    <P>
And you should also note that the book we have quoted from is one that makes tahqeeq (corroborating what is correct) of that which is in the madhhab - so it means that the book provides the actual, standard Ash'arite doctrines that they hold as their religion before Allaah, after resolving whatever differences have existed historically on the issue in their madhhab. In short, its the standard orthodox Ash'arite doctrine.    <P>
So it has become clear from the above that the inclusion of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> (rahimahullaah) into those lists of so called "Ash'ari" Scholars is spurious and an intellectual fraud. <P>
