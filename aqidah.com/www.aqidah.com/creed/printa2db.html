<font class='titleHeadline'>I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-manuscript.gif align=right hspace=4 border=0>The Book "I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah" (manuscript copy sample, first page, to the right) is authentically ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, and it has been mentioned by Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) in his book "Aqeedat us-Salaf wa Ashaabil-Hadeeth", and likewise by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in "Jaami al-Uloom wal-Hikam", referring to it as "the risaalah of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> to the people of the mountain." The book has a connected chain of narration to its author and it has been narrated with its chain by Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi in "Dhamm ut-Ta'weel", ad-Dhahabi in "<a href="tags/al-uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Uluww</font></a>", and in "Tadhkirat ul-Huffaadh" and "Siyar". And in his book "al-Arba'een Fee Sifaati Rabbil-Aalameen", adh-Dhahabee says, "And this <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> (al-mu'taqad), we have heard this from him with a saheeh isnaad (authentic chain of narration)" (p. 118). The book also has three hearings (samaa') in the years 574H, 617H, and 667H, the details of which are found in the manuscripts. So the book is firmly established and corroborated as being the work of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>. In these articles we will be quoting from the tahqeeq of Jamaal Azzoon, first edition, 1999, Dar Ibn Hazm.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Brief Note Regarding <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> and the Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Parading Under the Label of "Ash'ariyyah"</font>    <P>
We see these spurious, fraudulent lists of so called "Ash'ari" Scholars being circulated and spread on blogs and websites, with an impressive array of names mentioned therein, and Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee's name is often found in these lists. This is one of the greatest of frauds being perpetrated by the Jahmite Machinery that has taken on the label of "Ash'ariyyah" in the 20th and 21st century. Whilst this is not the place to digress away from the subject of this article, let it be known that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> was a Salafi, Sunni, Athari (all synonymous terms representing only one approach and one aqidah) and his <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> is in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah. He affirmed Allaah's Uluww, with His Essence, affirmed the attributes of Face, Hands, Eyes, and affirms that the Names of Allaah are not created (unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?msfeb>see here</a>), and affirmed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us is uncreated, and opposes the Lafdhiyyah <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (i.e. Ash'ariyyah) who say that al-lafdh al-maqroo' is created (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see here</a>). And he opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah on the subject of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, affirming that it is belief and action, that it increases and decreases. And further he affirms the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, without takyeef or ta'weel or tafweed, on account of it being reported in the authentic narrations. Inshaa'Allaah these details of belief from <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> will be the subject of this series of articles. We demand the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>to abide by the criterion</a> laid out <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>in this article</a> when imputing Ash'ariyyah to any Scholar.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Names (Asmaa) of Allaah Are Not Created</font>    <P>
Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-asmaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they [Ahl us-Sunnah] do not say, like the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Khawaarij, and [various] factions from the people of desires say, that Allaah's Names are other than Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
And in another manuscript, through the riwaayah of al-Haafidh Hamzah bin Yusuf as-Sahmee (d. 427H), there occurs (tahqeeq Muhammad al-Khumayyis, Dar ul-Fath, first edition, 1999):    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1573;&#1606; &#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1586; &#1608;&#1580;&#1604; - &#1603;&#1605;&#1575; &#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1593;&#1578;&#1586;&#1604;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1580; &#1608;&#1591;&#1608;&#1575;&#1574;&#1601; &#1605;&#1606; &#1571;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1607;&#1608;&#1575;&#1569; - &#1605;&#1582;&#1604;&#1608;&#1602;&#1577;.</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they [Ahl us-Sunnah] do not say like the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, Khawaarij and [various] factions from the people of desires say, that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic's Names are created.</blockquote>    <P>
And the two statements above are both the same in meaning for that which is "<u>other than Allaah</u>" is "<u>created</u>", and that was the intent of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> by claiming Allaah's Names are other than Him.    <P>
The subject of Allaah's Names being created or uncreated branches off from the subject of <a href='tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a> (Kalaam) and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and in this topic is another illustration of the odiousness of the scandals of the Ash'arites who agree with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that Allaah's  Names are created (as they believe that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us, in letter and word, is created), but have cleverly disguised the reality of their saying with - <b>yes you guessed it</b> - playing with definitions, that great hallmark of the Ash'arite <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a>.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The View of the Salaf on the Names of Allaah</font>    <P>
The view of the Salaf is that the Names of Allaah - being from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being Allaah's uncreated  Speech - are also uncreated. Allaah's speaking of those Names is not created, and as for the letters themselves, the position of Ahl us-Sunnah is to neither say they are created absolutely and nor uncreated absolutely, in opposition to the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> who say that the letters are created, and apply this saying absolutely. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> clarified the matter and explained that our speech, letters, voices are created because we are created, and <a href='tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a> is not created because He is not created. <a href='tags/al-laalikaaee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Laalikaa'ee</font></a> brings the following from <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> in his Sharh Usool il-I'tiqaad (no. 451)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ahmad-kalaam-tafseel.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Ahmad bin al-Hasan at-Tirmidhee said: I said to <a href='tags/ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad</font></a> bin Hanbal: The people have fallen into the issue of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, so how should I speak (on the matter)? He said: "Are you not created?" I said "Yes". He said: "And your speech coming from you is created". I said, "Yes". He said: "Is not the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> the Speech of Allaah?" I said, "Yes". He said, "And it is the Speech of Allaah." I said, "Yes." He said, "So does anything from Allaah be created?!"</blockquote>    <P>
Therefore, Ahl us-Sunnah say that the name "ar-Rahmaan" for example, consisting of the letters "Raa Haa Meem Noon", is not created, Allaah spoke that Name, it is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and nothing from Allaah is created, and Allaah speaks with His will and power, as and when He wills, upon the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of Ahl us-Sunnah. And the same for all other names. Whereas the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Ash'arites all say these Names are created since they all hold in absolute terms, that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, made up of letters is created. The only difference is that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> affirm no speech (kalaam) for Allaah, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> hold that it is permissible to call Allaah "one who speaks (mutakallim)" with "speech (kalaam)" on account of the speech He creates in others and the Ash'aris say, rather Allaah is "mutakallim" on account of the "kalaam nafsee". These differences are subsidiary to their agreement that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, in letter and word, the only <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that all Muslims have known, is created.    <P>
Ahl us-Sunnah say that Allaah in his perfect, all-encompassing knowledge, knows from eternity all the languages of all of His <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, and He is one who speaks and has always been one who speaks, and He is able to speak with whatever He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills, and that He spoke to Moses, directly in language and speech that Moses heard and understood, and that He spoke the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and other revealed books and that <a href='tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a>, in letter and voice, is not created, and all of this is from His perfection. So the departing point between Ahl us-Sunnah is that they affirm the speech that is letter and voice,that is heard, and that Allaah speaks as and when He wills, however He wills, whereas the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> reject that Allaah speaks with letter and voice, and they reject that He speaks as and when He wills as this contradicts Aristotle's Ten Categories (al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar) which they have made to be the foundation of their <a href='tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad. <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?fsffi>Refer to this article</a> for statements of <u><a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a></u> and <u>Imaam al-Bukhaaree</u> on affirmation of voice for Allaah.    <P>
Following on from this, anyone who said the names of Allaah are created was declared a kaafir by the Imaams of the Salaf, as it was simply an extension of their saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> itself is created.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Refer to this article for a detailed discussion of the subject matter as well as the relevant quotes from the Salaf:    <P>
<ul><li>	  <b>Imaam Ahmad: 'Whoever Says Allaah's Names are Created is a Kaafir'. Ash-Shaafi'ee: 'Allaah's Names Are Not Created'</b> - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?msfeb>read article here</a>.</ul></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Position of the Ash'arites</font>    <P>
Whilst the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> clear hold and state that the Names of Allaah are "other than Him" and are "created", the Asha'rites, as is their habit, use their hallmark of playing with words and definitions to conceal the fact that they agree with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> in reality and in substance, whilst claiming agreement with Ahl us-Sunnah which in reality is in wording only. Let's give a couple of examples.    <P>
<b><u>Example 1: Allaah's Uluww</u></b>    <P>
They agree with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Kafirs like Ibn Sina (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>) that Allaah is "<i>Neither within the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, nor outside of it</i>", and this is what they hold as the absolute truth, in this matter. However, as all people would scorn them, and throw tomatoes at them on the streets and in the markets if they came out and clearly said "<i>Allaah is not above the Throne</i>" and "<i>Allaah is not above the heaven</i>" - because this would be <u>clear takdheeb (rejection)</u>  of phrases that are from the clear explicit texts of revelation - they disguise their sayings and so they take one of two methods:     <P>
<blockquote>a) Say, "Allaah is (<u>not in a location</u>) above the Throne", and this is an innovated saying that they innovated to conceal their real and true doctrine whilst screening themselves from the scorn of the people, for they hold that saying "Allaah is above the Throne" is tajseem and <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> because according to Aristotle's "al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar" (Ten Categories) attributing "direction" to Allaah means attributing "location" and attributing "location" means making Allaah into a body (jism), since direction and location are only the incidental attributes (a'raad) of bodies (jism). <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?glwlf>Refer to this lecture</a> by the First Teacher, the Ustaadh, Abu Nicomachus Aristotle (d. 322BC) to learn more about that.    <P>
b) Say, "Allaah is above the Throne and above the heaven and above all creation", and what they really mean is "aboveness" in "status" and "rank", but not with His Essence, just like it is said, "Gold is above silver", meaning in value, status and rank. So this way, they can say to the people, "We believe Allaah is above the creation" deceiving the people into thinking that they speak with what the Salaf spoke with, whereas in reality, they are concealing the <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> of the Jahmites that there is no Lord above the heaven, and no deity above the Throne - see the Salaf wise to these Jahmites <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>in this series of articles here</a>. </blockquote>    <P>
They make use of either of these sayings according to what is appropriate to the situation to conceal what esentially amounts to <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>. But why is behind all of this? Their having to conform to the requirements of the <b>Tawheed of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad</b> because according to Aristotle's "<u>Ten Categories</u>", "aboveness" is an incidental attribute ('arad) of bodies (ajsaam), and since we've just argued with the <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> that the universe is created because it is made up of bodies that have incidental attributes amongst which is "aboveness", we can't now turn around to them and speak to them with what is in the revealed texts that "<i>Allaah is above the Throne</i>", because that would invalidate our proof and make us look silly in front of those <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>Example 2: Allaah's Kalaam</u></b>    <P>
In opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who held this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, present with us, in letter and word, is created, the Salaf held it was uncreated. They believed just in one <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Then along came Ibn Kullaab and the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a>, and the Ash'ariyyah who adopted the doctrine of the <a href='tags/kullaabiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kullaabiyyah</font></a> and this essentially summarizes their take on the matter:    <P>
<blockquote>Hey, we have to agree with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, present with us, in letter and word, is created. After all, according to the intellectual proof that we share with them to argue against the <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a>, that of "hudooth ul-ajsaam", Allaah can't be subject to incidental attributes (a'raad) or events (hawaadith), and since this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is made up of letters, and it is more than one meaning, it has different surahs, it has a beginning and an end, then it can't really be the speech of Allaah. This just simply is not compatible with our <a href='tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad which we share with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> (even though we differ with them as to what can or cannot be affirmed and rejected for Allaah so as not to invalidate this sacred intellectual proof). So the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are correct, this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, recited, heard, memorized, written (in its letter and word) is created, because there is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> what indicates is "hudooth" (meaning, created). But at the same time, we want to affirm the attribute of speech for Allaah (so as not to be seen as agreeing with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah) without invalidating the intellectual proof we actually share with those Jahmites and Mu'tazilites against the <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a>.     <P>
So how can we do that? Mmm... Ting! Got it.     <P>
We'll just innovate a new definition for "kalaam", different to what is known in the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the language of the Arabs, one that allows us to affirm "kalaam" for Allaah, but at the same time, prevents us from invalidating our intellectual proof that is built upon Aristotle's Ten Categories (al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar).     <P>
<b>So after thanking the Trinitarian Christian poet called  "al-Akhtal" for some lines of poetry (dubiously ascribed to him), and then looking for revealed texts that we can use to support and consolidate the alleged line of poetry from the Trinitarian Christian, "kalaam" is now "<u>a meaning in the self</u>" only and (exclusive of the wording, lafdh) it is just "<u>a singular indivisible meaning</u>" with respect to Allaah - and we've just solved our problem.</b>    <P>
We can now silence those nasty hostile <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> who might have otherwise accused us of affirming occurrences (hawaadith) for Allaah if we affirmed "kalaam" like Ahl us-Sunnah do (speech is meaning and wording and Allaah speaks as and when He wills). Well we don't because "kalaam" now is  just a singular meaning in the self and not something that is meaning and wording that Allaah speaks according to His will as and when He pleases (as all of that would be hawaadith necessitating jismiyyah).     <P>
At the same time we can turn to the general folk and say, "<i>Hey, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is <a href='tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a>, uncreated</i>" - but what we really mean by "uncreated" is the "<u>eternal Qur'an</u>" that exists with Allaah, that "<u>singular, indivisible meaning existing with Allaah's self from eternity</u>", we don't mean the "<u>other</u>" <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the "<u>second created Qur'an</u>" that is present with us, in letter and word like those suckers think we do, but we'll just let them keep thinking that anyway, unless push comes to shove and we are forced to explain our view in public.     <P>
And Bingo! We've just made everyone happy with some nice word play! We've affirmed "kalaam" for Allaah, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> can't accuse us of affirming "hawaadith" for Allaah and we can still say to everybody else that we hold "the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the Speech of Allaah uncreated!", without being accused of saying the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is created. And to keep the lid tight on everything, we'll just make sure that we don't preach our real doctrine of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created except in private in our classrooms, schools and institutions, and forbid that it be said in open.     <P>
And you see <u>this</u> is the ingenuity we put in to "<u>standardizing</u>" the doctrines and facing up to those "nasty, evil" Philosophers and <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> who were about to destroy <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>  and those "horrible" <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who were trying to accuse us of invalidating the same intellectual proof of "hudooth ul-ajsaam" that we <s>plagiarized</s>, <s>borrowed</s>, acquired from them (you've really got to <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrgly>see here</a> and <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ippev>see here</a>).</blockquote>    <P>
Now, don't believe us? This is the actual reality of their position. If you still don't believe us, go and read it in their own words, from their very own books. They actually agree with the Mu'tazilah:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li><b>Imaam ul-Haramayn al-Juwaynee (d. 478H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created - We Just Differ on a Matter of Wording Which Is On Account Of What Can We Call Allaah 'Mutakallim' (One Who Speaks) - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?eujbe>see here</a>)  <li><b>Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti</b>: We (The Ash'aris) and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are United that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Is Created And What the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Call 'Knowledge (al-Ilm)' and 'Will (al-Iraadah)', We Simply Call 'al-Kalaam an-Nafsee' - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?kiagk>see here</a>)  <li><b>Fakhr ud-Deen ar-Razi (d. 606H)</b>: We Agree With the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> That the (Recited) <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is Created And Our Dispute Is One of Wording Only - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?hirxg>see here</a>)  <li><b>The Haashiyah of al-Bayjoori</b>: The Qur'aan We Memorize and Recite Is Makhlooq (Created) And Is From Hudooth - But We Only Say That In Private, Not Openly - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ajlfv>see here</a>)  <li><b> The Haashiyah of al-Bayjoori</b>: Is the Created <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> Better Than the Prophet or is the Prophet Better Than the Created Qur'an?  - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see here</a>)  <li> <b>The Ash'aris</b>: We Believe in Two Qur'ans - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ilvva >see here</a>)  </ul></div>    <P>
By now you get the picture. Words and definitions are great for playing about with the truth - after all that's what Ilm ul-Kalaam is about, right! So let's come back to the topic of Allaah's Names, and see how the Ash'arites deal with this particular problem.    <P>
