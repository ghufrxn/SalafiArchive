Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font class='titleHeadline'>And belief in the [Revealed] Books comprises four things</font>    <P>
<b>Firstly:</b> That we believe that Allaah, the Most High, sent down books upon the Messengers, and that they are from Allaah. However, we do not believe that the books [currently] present in the possession of these nations are the [very] books that are from Allaah, because they are distorted, changed. However, we believe the original revealed Book [sent down to] the Messenger is truly from Allaah.    <P>
<b>Secondly:</b> That we believe in the correctness of what is in them (i.e. the revealed books in general) of information (akhbaar), like (for example) the information in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and the information in what has not undergone distortion or change from the previous books.    <P>
<b>Thirdly:</b> That we believe in what they contain of rulings (ahkaam), when they (the rulings) do not oppose our Sharee'ah, [based] upon the [particular] viewpoint that the legislation of those who preceded us is also a legislation for us, and that is the truth.    <P>
<b>Fourthly:</b> That we believe in what we know of their names, such as "<u>The Qur'an</u>" (the Recital), "<u>the Tawrat</u>" (the Torah), "<u>the Injeel</u>" (the Gospel), "<u>the Zaboor</u> (<a href='tags/scrolls.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Scrolls</font></a>) [of Dawud]" , "<u>the Suhuf</u> (<a href='tags/scrolls.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Scrolls</font></a>)" of Ibraaheem, and "<u>the Suhuf</u> (<a href='tags/scrolls.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Scrolls</font></a>)" of Moosaa.    <P>
And if a man was to say: I do not believe that there is a book called "Tawraat", then he is a disbeliever, because <a href='tags/faith-in-allaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith in Allaah</font></a> comprises <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> in the Books.  </blockquote>    <P>
