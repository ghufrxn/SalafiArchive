The <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf with respect to <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> is summarized as:    <P>
<ul><li>Eemaan is belief, speech and action, all of these enter into <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and are from the reality of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>. Thus, holding the belief that "<i>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah</i>" or <i>"the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is the speech of Allaah</i>" <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, and the feeling of love in the heart for Allaah, or hope or fear <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, and testifying "<i>None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone</i>" <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and saying "<i>Subhaanallaah</i>", or commanding someone "<i>Fear Allaah and do not backbite</i>" <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, and removing something harmful from the floor or performing prayer <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, and not stealing, or backbiting, and withholding one's limbs from falling into these actions <u>is</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>. The outward actions of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> are not merely the "fruits" and "consequences" of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> as the Murji'at ul-Fuquhaa say, rather they <u>are</u> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> itself.  <li> <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience and <u>it is not</u> just a single indivisible entity that does not admit to increase, decrease - such that if some of it goes all of it goes (in the view of the Khawaarij and Mu'tazilah) or such that none of it goes no matter what actions one does (the Murji'ah) - as [in the erroneous view of both factions], <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> is just a single indivisible entity.  <li> It is permissible make an exception (al-istithnaa) for one's <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> by saying "<i>I am a believer, <u>if Allaah wills</u></i>", out of a) avoiding self-praise, and b) uncertainty about one's future actions and what one will die upon.  <li> <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> occurs by belief, speech and action and is not restricted to juhood and istihlaal only. Thus, a person becomes a disbeliever through <u>a belief held</u> (speech of the heart), <u>a feeling, emotion</u> harbored in the heart (pride, arrogance, hatred and so on [which is the heart's action]), <u>a statement</u> made by the tongue, or an <u>action performed</u> by the limbs.  </ul>    <P>
And inshaa'Allaah these affairs will be documented and explained in future articles from the speech of the Salaf past and present. For now, on the subject of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> (the opposite of eemaan) this is a reproduction of an almost ten-year old article (July 2000), with some additions:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Kufr (<a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a>) Can Occur Without Istihlaal or Juhood</font>    <P>
Amongst the actions of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> are those for which it is not necessary that a person make istihlaal of them (i.e. declare them to be lawful as a matter of belief) before his action is considered major <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> that expels from the fold of <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>.    <P>
Shaikh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in "<i>As-Saarim al-Maslool</i>" (p.514):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is necessary for it to be known that the statement that 'the <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> of the one who reviled (Allaah, the Messenger or the religion) is only <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> because he made istihlaal of his act (i.e. declared this revilement to be lawful)' is a repugnant mistake and very great error...and this is from numerous angles...</blockquote>    <P>
When a person reviles the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) or throws the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> into some filth, or kicks the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> without compulsion, heedlessness, or out of error for example, then it is <u>not a requirement</u> nor <u>a condition</u> that he considers or declares this act to be lawful (istihlaal) as a matter of belief before this act is considered <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> and takfir is made upon him. Rather it is sufficient to known that he intended his act and did it wilfully, meaning he chose to do the act, desiring it, intending it, not being under compulsion or the likes.    <P>
As for Istihlaal (having the belief that something that Allaah has made unlawful is lawful), then it is of two types, that which is related to action, and that which is related to belief.    <P>
Shaikh Ibn Uthaimeen said in "<i>Liqaa Baab al-Maftoo</i>" (no. 1200):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Istihlaal is that a person believes that something that Allaah has made unlawful is lawful. As for Istihlaal of action, then we need to observe: If this Istihlaal (is related to something) that expels from the religion then a person becomes a disbeliever and apostate by it. So for example, if a person worked with usury (i.e. took or gave usury) without believing in its lawfulness, yet he persists in working with it, then such a one does not become a disbeliever because he did not declare it to be lawful. However, if he said, "<i>Usury is lawful</i>" and he intends by this the usury that Allaah has declared unlawful, then he becomes a disbeliever, since he is a denier (mukaddhib) of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam). So in this circumstance, Istihlaal would be that of action and also that of belief, with his heart. However, the Istihlaal in action, we need to look at the action itself, is it something which in and of itself, expels from the religion or not? And it is known that consuming interest does not make a person a disbeliever, rather it is one of the major sins. However, if a person prostrated to an idol, then he becomes a disbeliever. Why? Because this act itself expels from the religion. This is the principle, however it is necessary for us to observe another condition, and this is that the person who made something lawful (by istihlaal) is not excused due to ignorance, for if he is excused due to ignorance, then he does not become a disbeliever.</blockquote>    <P>
So Istihlaal is of two types, that which is related to <u>action</u> and that which is related to <u>belief</u>. That which is related to belief is <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> <u>in all circumstances</u>, regardless of whether this istihlaal was in relation to something that only reaches the level of minor <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> or something reaching the level of major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>. For example, if one made fornication lawful as a matter of belief, or drinking and likes then he is a disbeliever. Likewise, if he made reviling the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) or reviling the religion to be lawful, then regardless of whether he did the act or not, then he becomes a disbeliever by this istihlaal. So this type of istihlaal is <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> (<a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>) which expels from the religion, in all circumstances.    <P>
As for the istihlaal that is related to action, and this merely means that a person commits the act - in other words he makes it lawful for himself in terms of his action only, in the sense that he performs the act, allowing and permitting himself (from his choice) to fall into it - then in such a situation one must look at the action he committed. Is it something that does not reach the level of major kufr? Such as fornication, stealing, gambling and the likes. In this case he is not a disbeliever by this Istihlaal of action. However, if it is an act (or statement) which expels from the religion, such as prostrating to an idol, then he becomes a disbeliever by this Istihlaal of action.     <P>
And this is the principle concerning Istihlaal in the view of our Ulamaa. In light of this, the well known statement of Imaam at-Tahaawi: "<i>We do not declare someone a disbeliever on account of a sin he committed, so long as he does not declare it lawful.</i>" Is subject to the above clarification and qualification <u>and is not taken absolutely</u>.    <P>
With respect to Juhood (wilful rejection), then Imaam Abu Ja'far at-Tahaawi said "<i>A servant does not exit from <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> except by denial (juhood) of that which brought him into it</i>." Shaikh Ibn Maani' wrote in his brief commentary on it:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He intends to refute the Khawarij and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> by this, those who expel such a person from <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> on account of a sin that he commited</blockquote>    <P>
And Shaikh Ibn Baaz said, further clarifying this on his commentary on this text:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This absolute generalisation [of at-Tahawi] requires further examination. For a disbeliever enters into <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> by the two testifications if he had not uttered them previously, and if he was one who had uttered them, then he will enter into <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> (again) after repenting from what had necessitated his <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a>. And a person can exit from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> without showing Juhood (denial, rejection) for many reasons which the people of knowledge have explained in the discussion of the rulings pertaining to the apostate. Amongst them: when he reviles <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> or the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), or mocking Allaah, His Messenger or His Book or anything from His Legislation - free is he of imperfection - due to his saying,     <P>
<blockquote  class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say: Was it in Allaah, His Signs and His Messenger that you were mocking? Do not seek to make excuses, for you have disbelieved after having had faith!" (at-Tawbah 9:65-66).  </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And also amongst such (actions) are worshipping idols, calling upon the dead, seeking help from them, seeking assistance from them and other such things. Therefore, whoever directs any of these (acts of worship) to other than Allaah, such as to idols, the angels, the jinn, those in the graves and others from the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> then such a one has committed Shirk with Allaah and has not actualised the meaning of "<i>Laa ilaaha ilallaaha</i>". All of these matters cause a person to exit from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> by unanimous agreement of the Muslims, and they are not from the matters of Juhood (denial, rejection). The proofs for these matters are well known from the Book and the Sunnah, and the Scholars have mentioned them in the chapters related to the ruling upon the apostate, so refer back to them if you will. And in Allaah lies success.</blockquote>    <P>
Just like our discussion with Istihlaal above, there are some actions for which Juhood, that is denial or rejection, is not a requirement for an action to be considered as major <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> (kufr akbar) and what expels from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. Rather such actions, in and of themselves are major <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> and expel from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. However, it is worth noting here, for the sake of completeness, that some of the Scholars have said that all of those matters which expel from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>, then the basis of all of that is Juhood (denial, rejection) of what the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) came with, from the consideration of the angle of the necessity of the hujjah being established upon a person before he is judged a kaafir.    <P>
Shaikh 'Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir as-Sa'dee said in "<i>Manhaj us-Saalikeen</i>" (p.112):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Chapter: The Ruling upon the Apostate.</b> "The apostate, murtad, is the one who exits from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> and enters into <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> on account of an <u>action</u>, <u>statement</u>, a <u>belief</u> or <u>doubt</u>. And the Scholars - may Allaah have mercy upon them - have mentioned the specific detail and explanation of the matters by which a servant leaves <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. And all of them have their basis in the rejection, jahd, of what the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) came with, or rejection, jahd, of some of it. So the one who apostatizes should be asked to repent during the course of three days. If he repents and returns, then fine, otherwise he is to be killed with the sword.</blockquote>    <P>
If one was to consider this statement to mean that the acts of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, such as those mentioned above in the statement of Imaam Ibn Baaz are not to be considered as major <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> unless they are accompanied with Juhood and all return back to juhood, <u>then this is an erroroneous understanding of what as-Sa'dee has said</u>. Rather such acts in and of themselves are major <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a>. Hence, if the latter part of the above statement of as-Sa'dee is taken in isolation, it leads to a faulty understanding. But the Shaykh at the beginning clearly stated that a person leaves <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> through a belief, statement, action or doubt.  And regarding what he said after this, then it means that a person becomes an apostate and the hadd punishment applied <u>after the proof has been established (iqaamat ul-hujjah)</u> and the person does not repent or desist or recant from his act or statement of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, but persists in  choosing death over repentance, then his indicates his "jahd" (rejection) of what the Messenger (alayhis salaam) came with, alongside the fact that  the act that he initially committed was major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> on its own, independently, which negated his <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>.  Then this is in conformity with <u>the principle of takfir</u> concerning those who fall into these acts <u>which is that the proof is established against them and their repentance is sought</u> before making the takfir of the individual and applying whatever follows on from it. However, this does not mean that <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> is restricted to mere "juhood", so whoever understood that from the statement of as-Sa'dee is in error.    <P>
Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab said, as quoted in "<i>Aqidat us-Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab</i>" (p.208) of Shaikh Salih al-Ubood:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[The apostate] is the one who has disbelieved according to the consensus (ijmaa) of the Muslims, and he is the one upon whom the proof has been established. The one upon whom the proof has not been established is not to be declared a disbeliever.</blockquote>    <P>
<u>In summary</u>, we say that the amongst the actions of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> are those which do not require istihlaal of the heart or juhood of the heart be present for them to be considered actions of major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>  which expel from <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. It is not required a person hold as his belief that mocking the Messenger (alayhis salaam) or reviling Allaah, or the religion, or prostrating to an idol is "lawful" before his act is deemed to be <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> (that expels from Islaam) after his performance of it, for it is major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> regardless. Similarly it is not required that he made "juhood" (denial, rejection) of the prohibition of these actions of major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> before these actions are considered to be major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> in and of themselves, for they are major <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> regardless.   <P>
