<font class='titleHeadline'>I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-manuscript.gif align=right hspace=4 border=0>The Book "I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah" (manuscript copy sample, first page, to the right) is authentically ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, and it has been mentioned by Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) in his book "Aqeedat us-Salaf wa Ashaabil-Hadeeth", and likewise by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in "Jaami al-Uloom wal-Hikam", referring to it as "the risaalah of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> to the people of the mountain." The book has a connected chain of narration to its author and it has been narrated with its chain by Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi in "Dhamm ut-Ta'weel", ad-Dhahabi in "<a href="tags/al-uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Uluww</font></a>", and in "Tadhkirat ul-Huffaadh" and "Siyar". And in his book "al-Arba'een Fee Sifaati Rabbil-Aalameen", adh-Dhahabee says, "And this <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> (al-mu'taqad), we have heard this from him with a saheeh isnaad (authentic chain of narration)" (p. 118). The book also has three hearings (samaa') in the years 574H, 617H, and 667H, the details of which are found in the manuscripts. So the book is firmly established and corroborated as being the work of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>. In these articles we will be quoting from the tahqeeq of Jamaal Azzoon, first edition, 1999, Dar Ibn Hazm.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Brief Note Regarding <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> and the Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Parading Under the Label of "Ash'ariyyah"</font>    <P>
We see these spurious, fraudulent lists of so called "Ash'ari" Scholars being circulated and spread on blogs and websites, with an impressive array of names mentioned therein, and Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee's name is often found in these lists. This is one of the greatest of frauds being perpetrated by the Jahmite Machinery that has taken on the label of "Ash'ariyyah" in the 20th and 21st century. Whilst this is not the place to digress away from the subject of this article, let it be known that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> was a Salafi, Sunni, Athari (all synonymous terms representing only one approach and one aqidah) and his <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> is in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah. He affirmed Allaah's Uluww, with His Essence, affirmed the attributes of Face, Hands, Eyes, and affirms that the Names of Allaah are not created (unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?msfeb>see here</a>), and affirmed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us is uncreated, and opposes the Lafdhiyyah <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (i.e. Ash'ariyyah) who say that al-lafdh al-maqroo' is created (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see here</a>). And he opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah on the subject of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, affirming that it is belief and action, that it increases and decreases. And further he affirms the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, without takyeef or ta'weel or tafweed, on account of it being reported in the authentic narrations. Inshaa'Allaah these details of belief from <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> will be the subject of this series of articles. We demand the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>to abide by the criterion</a> laid out <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>in this article</a> when imputing Ash'ariyyah to any Scholar.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Affirmation of <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat</font></a> Dhaatiyyah and a Refutation of The Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Who Attempt To Distinguish Between the Attributes</font>    <P>
Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-sifaat-dhaat.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they [Ahl us-Sunnah] affirm that He has a Face, Hearing, Seeing, Knowledge, Power (Qudrah, Quwwah), Might (Izzah), and Speech. Not upon what the people of deviation, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and others say, but rather, as the Blessed and Exalted said:     <P>
<ul><li>[He said]: "<b>And the Face of Your Lord shall remain</b>..." (55:27),   <li>And He said: "<b>He sent it down (the Qur'an) with His knowledge</b>..." (4:166),    <li>And He said: "<b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</b>..." (2:255)  <li>And He said: "...<b>then to Allah belong all izzah (might, honour, power and glory)</b>..." (35:10)  <li>And He said: "<b>And the Heaven, we constructed with power</b>..." (51:47)  <li>And He said "...<b>See they not that Allah, Who created them was mightier in strength than them</b>..." (41:15)  <li>And He said: "<b>Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong</b>."  (51:58)</ul>    <P>
For He, the Exalted, possesses knowledge, strength, power, hearing, seeing, and speech, as He,     <P>
<ul><li>The Exalted said: "...<b>In order that you may be brought up under My Eye</b>."  (20:39), "<b>And construct the ship under Our Eyes</b>..." (11:37)  <li>And He said: "...<b>so that he [the mushrik seeking protection] hears the speech of Allaah</b>..." (9:6)  <li>And He said: "<b>And Allaah spoke to Moses directly</b>." (4:164), "<b>Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, "Be!" and it is</b>!"  (36:82)</ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
This passage contains some extremely important points which should not be missed, whilst noting that today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> claim <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> is an <s>Ash'arite</s> Jahmite like them (in their rejection of what the Salaf <u>and the early Kullaabi Ash'aris</u> affirmed for Allaah without ta'weel and tafweed):    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes and Comments</font>    <P>
<b><u>Point 1:</u></b> Prior to this text, <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> affirmed the attribute of two Hands for Allaah (<a href=indexa91b.html?dqxkb>this was covered in a previous article here</a>). Here he affirms Face, and Eyes, alongside the attributes of hearing, seeing, knowledge, power, might, and speech, and he affirmed that those who reject such attributes (inclusive of Face, Hands etc.) are the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, (who along with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> were the pioneers of the various ta'weels).    <P>
<b><u>Point 2:</u></b> This indicates the academic fraud of today's Ash'arites who try to make a distinction between the attributes of (<u>face, hands, eyes</u>) and (<u>hearing, seeing, knowledge, will, power, speech, life</u>) claiming the former cannot be except limbs - and this is from the tajseem and repugnance and filth that originated in their own hearts, because they did not understand the revealed texts except with the likenesses they see in the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>. This claim of theirs was dealt with in detail in <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?inevm>a separate article here</a>. And when that repugnance and filth originated in their hearts, then when they heard Ahl us-Sunnah affirming these attributes (with the negation of takyeef and tamtheel and tashbeeh), they threw the filth that originated in their hearts upon Ahl us-Sunnah and began to call them "Mujassimah Hashawiyyah" - and the first to originate this slander were the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><u>Point 3:</u></b> <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> has brought all of these attributes and treated them all the same, which is affirmation of <u>the true and real existence of the attribute</u> with negation of tamtheel and tashbeeh - as opposed to (the saying of the Jahmites, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and later Ash'arites):    <P>
<blockquote><i>I affirm <u>the word</u> 'yad' exists in the texts, it could mean 'qudrah', or 'ni'mah', but then again, it could also be the case that nobody knows what these words refer to at all and Allaah knows best what it means, but for sure it is not the dhaahir (apparent meaning) because that is pure tajseem.</i></blockquote>    <P>
This is the reality of their saying.     <P>
In all of the above, bear in mind that today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> posing as "Ash'ariyyah" claim <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> was an "Ash'ari" - whilst also bearing in mind the difference between the early Kullaabi Ash'aris and the later Jahmite Ash'aris - learn more about that in <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.cfm>this series here</a> and also <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/series/ibn-kullaab-d-240h-the-true-and-real-author-of-the-creed-of-the-earlier-asharis.cfm>this one here</a> on Ibn Kullaab.    <P>
<b><u>Point 4:</u></b> Refutation of the claimed ta'weel of the word "aydin" that occurs in the verse, "<b>And the heaven we constructed it with power</b>" - for <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> quotes the verse in order to establish the attribute of "quwwah" which is what al-ayd means. The claim that this verse means "<b>And the heaven, we constructed it <u>with hands</u></b>" - (treating al-ayd to be the plural of hand) -  using this to make the claim that the Salaf, when they explained this verse to mean "with power", therefore, made ta'weel is from the scandals of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bzrsj>See this article</a> that deals with the scandal of Nuh Keller in this regard.    <P>
