The book "<i><a href='../tags/sharh-us-sunnah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sharh us-Sunnah</font></a></i>" of al-Imaam Abu Muhammad al-Hasan bin Alee bin Khalf <a href='../tags/al-barbahaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="../tags/barbahaaree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">barbahaaree</font></a></font></a> (d. 329H) is contained in Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah of Abu Ya'laa (2/18), and exists in  manuscript form in al-Maktabah adh-Dhaahiriyyah in Damascus in the writing of the Imaam, Abu al-Qaasim Ubayd Allaah bin Hamza (d. 550H), and it has been ascribed to <a href='../tags/al-barbahaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-<a href="../tags/barbahaaree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">barbahaaree</font></a></font></a> by Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in "<i>Bughyat ul-Murtaad</i>", adh-Dhahabi in "<i><a href='../tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Uluww</font></a></i>" and "<i>Taareekh ul-Islaam</i>", and "<i>Siyar</i>", also by Ibn Muflih in "<i>al-Furoo</i>" and "<i>al-Aadaab ash-Sharee'ah</i>", and also by as-Safadee in "<i>al-Waafee bil-Wafayaat</i>", and by Ibn Hajar in "<i>Fath al-Baaree</i>", and by Ibn al-Imaad in "<i>Shadharaat adh-Dhahab</i>"    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction to the book by the Explainer: The Noble Shaikh, the Scholar, S&#257;lih al-Fawz&#257;n</font>    <P>
The Scholar, S&#257;lih al-Fawz&#257;n stated in his introduction of the  monumental work, 'Sharhus-Sunnah' (Maktabatur-Rushd, 1429H/2008):    <P>
All praise is due to All&#257;h, Lord of the worlds - may the salutations of All&#257;h and His peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family and his <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>.    <P>
The author of this book is al-Barbah&#257;ree, and his name is: al-Hasan bin &#8219;Al&#299; bin Khalaf al-Barbah&#257;ree, this title being an affiliation to "Barbah&#257;r" which is a type of medicine<sup>[1]</sup>, so perhaps he used to work in the field of medicines or sell it. He was from the major Hanbalee scholars taking knowledge from those who studied under Im&#257;m <a href='../tags/ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a>, such as al-Marroozee<sup>[2]</sup> and others. He studied thoroughly, and delved deeply into knowledge. He acquired the &#8219;aq&#299;dah, fiqh and other knowledge from the great scholars<sup>[3]</sup>.  The title of the book is Sharh as-Sunnah, i.e. Explanation of the Sunnah - the intent of the term Sunnah here is The Path of the Messenger. The intent here is not that of the terminology employed by the Scholars of Had&#299;th who state: <b>"The Sunnah is whatever is affirmed upon the Prophet of statements, actions or tacit approvals,"</b> rather the intent is more general, that being: The Path of the Messenger, The Path of his <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> and the Path of the Pious Predecessors (as-Salaf as-S&#257;lih) - and this is the Sunnah that has been transmitted and passed down, whether it be in belief, in worship, in fiqh, or in manners and ettiquette. All of this is referred to as the Sunnah in a general sense.    <P>
Occassionally the author may make mention of affairs connected to fiqh such as wiping over the socks during wudhoo and  the temporary marriage for the purpose of refuting the misguided sects in opposition these affairs. He may repeat and reiterate certain affairs for the purpose of emphasis or relevance or further elaboration, or another knowledge-based purpose - so in general it is a beneficial book.     <P>
What follows is a mention of its importance from the aspect of its age - it is from the books of the Pious Predecessors of old who lived in the era of the Great Im&#257;ms, who took knowledge from them and transmitted their pure <i>&#8219;aq&#299;dah</i>, so may All&#257;h's Mercy be upon the honorable Im&#257;m.    <P>
The word, "Explanation (<i>Sharh</i>).." in the title of the book means "Clarification". It does not mean that al-Barbah&#257;ree is about to explain a specific book, or to write a commentary on a book. Rather its meaning is that he is making clear the Path of the Sunnah - this is the meaning of the title <i>Sharh as-Sunnah</i>.    <P>
The early scholars would entitle the books of belief, <i>"as-Sunnah"</i> such as this book, or such as <i>as-Sunnah</i> of Im&#257;m <a href='../tags/ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad</font></a>, <i>as-Sunnah</i> of his son &#8219;Abdull&#257;h, <i>as-Sunnah</i> of al-Athram, <i>Sharh Usool I&#8219;tiqaad ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam&#257;&#8219;ah</i> of al-L&#257;lik&#257;'ee.    <P>
Likewise they were entitled <i>"al-&#298;m&#257;n"</i>, so some books would have chapters entitled <i>Kit&#257;b al-&#298;m&#257;n</i>, such as is present in Sah&#299;h al-Bukh&#257;ree and Muslim - they would include into their works chapters entitled, <i>Kit&#257;b al-&#298;m&#257;n</i>, placing therein that with is specific to the &#8219;aq&#299;dah: Belief in All&#257;h, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, the Pre-Decree, its good and evil.  Other books were entitled <i>"ash-Shar&#299;&#8219;ah"</i> such as <i>ash-Shar&#299;&#8219;ah</i> of Im&#257;m &#256;jurree ash-Sh&#257;fi&#8219;ee. Others were entitled, <i>"at-Tawh&#299;d"</i> such as <i>Kit&#257;b at-Tawh&#299;d</i> of Ibn Khuzaimah and the well-known books of Tawh&#299;d. And they were called <i>"al-&#8219;Aq&#299;dah"</i> which is the firm belief of the heart, by which one's practices his religion and is obligated with.    <P>
There is no differing in these titles - these are merely different names for the same thing. There is no contention concerning these names. If the intent is known then there is no differing. So this is mere terminology and each term has its persepective, so even though the words differ, the meaning is the same.    <P>
As for those who reject this and say:     <blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The terms <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> and <i>tawh&#299;d</i> have no evidence to support their usage - these terms are not found in the Qur'&#257;n or the Sunnah.</blockquote>    <P>
This is a doubt they put forth <b>wishing to eradicate</b> the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> - so they brought about this speech so as to remove the distinction between the Sects of Misguidance and the Sect that is upon the Straight Path - and this distinction is what enrages them.    <P>
Due to this they do not refute the people of falsehood - and this is the actual intent of the educated ones from amongst them. And as for the riff-raff and rabble who take from the cesspits of thinking, then they merely echo this foul speech as occurs in some newspapers and that which is referred to as 'authorships'!  So it is not permissible for one to pay attention to these doubts and this skepticism.    <P>
So this is something that the Ummah was accustomed to, and would give importance to - distinguishing between truth and falsehood and between guidance and misguidance. However these opposers have an intent in what they say - they wish to blend all the people together into one melting pot, so that there is no longer a difference between a godless person, an atheist, a heretic, an upright believer and an innovator! They all come under the banner of Islam for the purpose of uniting the Muslims as they claim!  So we say to these claimants: The Muslims will never be united except upon a correct common belief, i.e. <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>. It was the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> that united the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> whilst before they were a divided people, just as All&#257;h, the Most High, stated:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'>   &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1584;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1606;&#1616;&#1593;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1578;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1618; &#1603;&#1615;&#1606;&#1578;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1583;&#1614;&#1575;&#1569;&#1611; &#1601;&#1614;&#1571;&#1614;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614; &#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614; &#1602;&#1615;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1576;&#1616;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote  class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'><b> And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers.  &#256;li &#8219;Imr&#257;n, 103 </b><img src='../images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And what was it that united the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> after they were divided and split except this <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> that encompasses the meaning of the words  <i>l&#257; il&#257;ha illall&#257;hu, Muhammadun Rasoolull&#257;h</i>, i.e. "There is nothing worthy of worship in truth except All&#257;h and Muhammad is the Messenger of All&#257;h"?!    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>So nothing will unite the people except the correct and sound belief - and as for those who differ with each other in their beliefs, then they will never be united, ever.</b></blockquote>    <P>
As for differing in the affairs of juristic opinion in how to perform outward acts of worship (<i>fiqh</i>) where there is a possiblity of understanding the proofs differently, then this does not harm unity and does not cause division and enmity. This is due to the fact that these variant juristic conclusions (ijtih&#257;d) are tolerated, and as for differing in <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> then it is not tolerated [in the Religion] - people who differ in the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> will never be united ever regardless of how hard they try, because in essence they are attempting to unite opposites, and it is not possible to united opposing and contradictory affairs.     <P>
So if they truly wish to unite the Muslims together, then they are duty-bound to correct the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> first. Indeed the Messengers of All&#257;h, from the first of them till the last, gave utmost attention to it and would begin their call with it. So upon them is to be on a united <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> first and foremost. So if the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> is united, then the Ummah will be united - this of course if they are serious and true in their claim. However these individuals mock and belittle those who speak concerning the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> and call to the sound <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>. They proclaim: <b>"Look at him declaring the people to be unbelievers! He wishes only to divide the Muslims,"</b> and other similar accusations.    <P>
So we say: You will never be able to unite the Muslims upon other than the correct <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>. If the  <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> is united, then the people will be united easily:    <P>

So this is impossible to apply in matters of belief (&#8219;aqeedah). However if differing occurs in <i>fiqh</i><sup>[5]</sup> and affairs of fiqh where there is a possibility of conclusions, then this is tolerated with the proviso that it is still incumbent to follow the proofs - and this is even in affairs of <i>fiqh</i>, as All&#257;h (the Most High) has stated:    <P>

So division of the Muslims does not come about due to them differing in affairs of <i>fiqh</i> in which it possible to have an alternative understandings. For this reason within the ranks of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i> there is the Hanafee, the M&#257;likee, the Sh&#257;fi&#8219;&#299;, and the Hanbalee. And they did not differ (in the &#8219;aqeedah) and all praise is due to All&#257;h, nor separate from each other. This is because the differing amongst them was <i>ijtih&#257;d</i> in fiqh, i.e. striving to reach the correct juristic opinion - each one having a viewpoint and evidences that could be used as support. As for the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>, then in their <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> they were as one! The Hanbalees, the Sh&#257;fi&#8219;ees, the M&#257;likees and the Hanaf&#299;s have one <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>, even though amongst their followers there are those who oppose them in the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>. And this opposition is found in the Hanbalees, and in the Hanafees, and in the Sh&#257;fi&#8219;ees, and in the M&#257;likees - there is found amongst them those who oppose the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> of the Im&#257;ms. They ascribe only to the <i>fiqh</i> of the Im&#257;ms, and as it relates to the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i> they oppose them. So these people are not to be counted as followers of those Im&#257;ms because they follow them in an affair (i.e. in fiqh) yet they oppose them in an affair that is more important than that (i.e. in the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>). So they are not considered as followers of these Im&#257;ms whilst they oppose them in the <i>&#8219;aqeedah</i>.    <P>
This is what All&#257;h guided to by way of the Scholars such as al-Barbah&#257;ree and others in describing and illustrating the Straight Path as taken from the Book of All&#257;h, the Sunnah of His Messenger (salallaahu 'alaihi wassallam) and the guidance of the Salaf so that the Muslims may proceed upon it. And this is from sincere advice and sincerety to All&#257;h (the Most High), His  Messenger (salallaahu 'alaihi wassallam), His Book, to the Muslim Rulers and the general folk.     <P>
If the affair (of &#8219;aqeedah) had been taken lightly and had not been clarified and these works not been authored, then many people would have gone astray. So these authored works, and all praise is due to All&#257;h, are a blessing from All&#257;h (the Most High) and a proof from All&#257;h  upon His creation:    <P>
