<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Numerous people have been leading the 'Scientific Miracle' bandwagon and directing average Muslims into using this as a foundational basis for inviting others to Islam, and making it an essential part of having certainty in one's <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>. No doubt <u>this subject area has it's place</u> but taking this particular approach is not the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah in da'wah and the followers of <b>the Salafi methodology</b> have been warning against this for a very long time (<a href=http://www.spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=TZK09&amp;articleID=TZK090003&amp;articlePages=1>see this article, July 2001</a>), in which it was observed:    <P>
<blockquote>In particular, this methodology has been adopted by <a href='../tags/abdul-majeed-az-zindani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdul-Majeed az-Zindani</font></a> of Yemen (amongst other modern-day Mu'tazilites) and is taught in his University of Heresy, Jaami'at ul-Imaan to Muslims . Making the discussion of the "scientific miracle" of the Qur'aan or investigating and scientifically studying the natural phenomena into <b>the overall basis of the call to Islaam</b>, or giving an exaggerated emphasis to it and is a deviation from the Methodology of the Prophets. <b>It is even worse when it is made the basis of <a href='../tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> for Muslims(!!)</b>. And this is where the heresy of az-Zindani lies in that he has made the subject of <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> and <a href='../tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> to be almost synonymous with what is called the "scientific miracle" of the Qur'aan, bordering, if not wallowing in the ways of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, from certain angles. Az-Zindani teaches his book "Tawheed ul-Khaaliq" in his University of <a href='../tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> in Yemen. Az-Zindani makes the most desired goal, especially in our times to be "...<i>tying the true realities [of the religion] with their evidences that exist in the creation</i>..." - and this is the basis of his work on <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> entitled, "Tawheed ul-Khaaliq", and then he makes this "<i>the knowledge of <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a>, which is the basis of your religion</i>", and in reality this is but <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> ur-Ruboobiyyah, not Uloohiyyah. Az-Zindani defines <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> as "<i>the knowledge that is investigated into in order to establish and affirm [one's] religious beliefs with convincing rational and textual proofs that put an end to doubts</i>", and this is the basis upon which his book is built, being nothing but the repugnant madhhab of the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, who innovated this <a href='../tags/bidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bid'ah</font></a> of intellectually "proving" your <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>. Then he adds to this and says, "<i>You know that the knowledge of <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> (i.e. as he has explained it) is fard 'ayn upon every Muslim male and female so that every Muslim can attain both satisfaction and contentment of the heart and intellect that he is upon the true religion</i>...". And he also opines, "<i>And from the proud aspects of <a href='../tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> is that it is built upon intellect ('aql), and it never asks its adherents to stiffen their capabilities of thought</i>...". All of this is from the aforementioned book of az-Zindani. In reality, this type of knowledge that az-Zindani speaks of is most often the knowledge that involves speaking about Allaah without knowledge itself(!!). </blockquote>    <P>
And in the conclusion of that article:    <P>
<blockquote>There is a difference between the Mu'tazilite way of thinking of az-Zindanee and company and between what is actually desired from the reflection upon the signs of Allaah that are observed and witnessed. To az-Zindani, it is obligatory upon every Muslim to arrive at "<i>certainty</i>" about this <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> and to prove his <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> rationally and intellectually, such that no doubt can enter into it. This is the desired <a href='../tags/tawheed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawheed</font></a> to him and it centres around the "<b>Scientific Miracle</b>" of the Qur'aan for the most part to him. Though az-Zindani has taken aspects in which truth is contained (that is reflection upon Allaah's signs and the likes), they are actually made to fit in with his overall orientation, which is Mu'tazilite in origin. As has been stated before, all innovatory methodologies have something of the truth in them, hence, the reason why many fall prey to these methodologies. The mind-set that is created by az-Zindani's doctrine is that a Muslim must be free from doubt and speculation about his <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>. This causes many individuals - when they interface with non-Muslims - to exaggerate in the so-called "Scientific Miracle" and when they approach Non-Muslims to give da'wah, their primary method is to resort to this discussion of the "Scientific Miracle", and often this includes speaking about Allaah's book, and interpreting it, without knowledge and without guidance and without light and refuge is from Allaah. <b>And often if an intelligent and shrewd non-Muslim is being invited, he may be able to overcome the ignorant Muslim, cause confusion and doubt, and refuge is from Allaah. So the ignorant Muslim goes back and then tries to find further correlation between scientific data and the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and so on hoping to impress the one who he is calling</b>. And this approach has become widespread and has become the basis of all da'wah work to some people, and hence the great inherent danger. In reality, it is only something that encourages doubt in ones' <a href='../tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> and also excessive speculation and speaking without knowledge.  </blockquote>    <P>
Note that this was written 12 years ago and is almost a word for word accurate narrative of certain people who have carried the flag of this innovated method of da'wah. From the prominent callers to this way has been an individual known as <b><a href='../tags/hamza-tzortzis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hamza Tzortzis</font></a></b>, a Greek convert to Islam and like many of the converts to Islam in early Islamic <a href='../tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a>, he  brought much of his philosophical baggage and kalaam verbage with him. He is often introduced in debates as "<i>one who believes in combining between Islamic and Western philosophies in order to defend Islam</i>" (see his debate with the president of American <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a>, Ed Buckner). <a href='../tags/hamza-tzortzis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hamza Tzortzis</font></a> has been carrying the flag of this rhetoric for many years, getting thousands to join his bandwagon, and in the process allowing the enemies of Islam, from the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> and philosophers, to make a mockery of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and of Allaah, the Exalted. Indeed, we have watched and heard him being pulverized in his debates with a group of <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> (on the tube) and in the process he began to utter lies against the Islamic Shari'ah, attempting to deflect the criticism he was not able to handle, indicating that ignorant and shaky people like him who operate in the field of da'wah without having a firm grounding, being removed from the methodology of the Salaf in <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, manhaj and da'wah, are a danger to the Muslim community.  Whilst the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> alludes to certain natural phenomenon, and only to a certain level of detail that can be appreciated by people of all levels of knowledge and intelligence (since the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is intended as a guide,  admonition and proof for the whole of mankind), the primary purpose behind such texts is to make a man reflect on the universe and upon his own self and upon his own <a href='../tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> (how he came to be) and the favours and bounties of Allaah so as to come to a concrete realization: <b>That none has the right to be worshipped in truth except Allaah alone and that there is no true serenity and satisfaction for the hearts except in this</b>. It is not a book of detailed scientific knowledge, but a book of guidance and admonition.    <P>
Further, many of those who jump on this 'scientific miracle' bandwagon claim "<u>foreknowledge</u>," as in, mention of this information preceded modern science when in reality, some of these indications might already have been known to certain people or in certain civilizations or alluded to in books of antiquity. The <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, as the Shaykh indicates below, is not a book of science, geography, biology or astronomy, but it alludes to certain phenomena in certain contexts in order to demonstrate Allaah's kindness, benevelence and favour, as a means of showing that none has the right to be worshipped in truth but Him. And thus when something is indicated in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, what is of greater and immediate direct significance is the fact that it is a favour and bounty for mankind which he enjoys, and in which there are lessons, admonitions and reminders, not that "<i>this indication in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> preceded modern science and hence this is a miracle</i>," and turning this into the basis upon which the Qur'an's veracity is established. Such a claim requires a huge amount of historical study in order to ascertain and verify, requires in-depth specialist knowledge of the various subject areas, and of the science and achievements of all past civilizations and nations and is something that would exclude the majority of people due to its  great difficulty. This defeats the purpose of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being a guide for the whole of mankind and treats the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as something which cannot be believed in unless its miraculous nature has been proven by modern science, and whilst it is not denied that there are some indications of knowledge in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that precede modern knowledge, taking this as a manhaj in da'wah is a gross and serious error since it mostly involves speculation and twisting of facts just to fit in with the notion of the 'scientific miracle' as the Salafi scholars have indicated. This is a repetition of the way of Ahl al-Kalaam in the 2nd and 3rd centuries whose entire theology was founded upon the premise that their proof for the universe being originated (hudooth al-ajsaam) is something which the veracity of the entire religion is based upon alongside it being a corrupt and futile proof, and which subsequently allowed the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> and philosophers to attack the deen of <a href='../tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a>. Further, they (the Ahl al-Kalaam) subjected the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to the crime of tahreef (distortion) for the purpose of propping up this innovated proof. Many of the Ahl al-Kalaam of old stated that a person's <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> is not valid until and unless he knows this proof and is able to demonstrate it with all its (long winded) premises. In a similar way the 'scientific miracle' bandwagon peddlers have misguided thousands of people into this ideology, and led them into da'wah programs and methods of argument and debate which imply or leave a person with the notion that his <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> is weak, deficient and doubtful unless he builds certainty through establishing the Qur'an's truthfulness through this (speculative) method.    <P>
There are two parts to this article. We have the statement of Shaykh Muhammad Umar Bazmul who discusses the tafseer (explanation) by way of "opinion" that amounts to making verses carry meanings they do not bear, which is only one element of many dangerous elements manifested by those on the bandwagon. And after this we provide the classical exegesis from al-Tabari (d. 310H) and others in relation to the example given by the Shaykh.    </blockquote>   </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Muhammad Umar Bazmul on the Study of 'Scientific Miracle' in the <a href="../tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font>    <P>
In his commentary on the <i>Muqaddimah Usool al-Tafsir</i> of Shaykh al-Islam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (based on lectures given in 2002-2003), the Shaykh commented (p. 16):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>... And some people expand in this matter and boldly make the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to carry (in meaning) that which it does not carry of contemporary matters of knowledge, basing this around the issue of "<i>the Quran's amazing aspects do not expire</i>." And this scientific tafseer of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, it is from the perspective of explanation based upon (personal) opinion, and this is not accepted unless it fulfils the five conditions previously mentioned<sup>[*]</sup>. A person comes along and he enters (a meaning) into the explanation of the verse, and he makes it to carry scientific meanings which are negated in light of the context, or what has preceded, or what contradicts what has come from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and from the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a>, or what makes the word to depart from its actual linguistic indication (of meaning). So this is blameworthy explanation through opinion, and saying, "<i>(the Quran's) amazing aspects do not expire</i>" does not change anything in reality, because I say: Yes, it's amazing aspects to do not expire but it is not a book of science, it is not a book of geography, nor a book of engineering, noro a book of medicine, nor a book of  geology, nor a book of astronomy, and nor a book of biology. It is a <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, a book of guidance, a book of inimitability, you will not find a flaw in it. And using opinion to deduce (matters) as evidence from it requires the aforementioned conditions in acceptance of the explanation using opinion, and from this (category) is the scientific explanation! And approaching the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> from this foundation, in this manner (i.e. with the conditions), there is no harm in it.     <P>
For example, His saying, the Most High, "<b>Between them both is a partition (barzakh) that they do not transgress</b>" (55:20), this is an indication to a scientific reality which is when rivers meet oceans there is a separating barrier. They say in (the  matter of) <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, "the life of the barzakh (partition)" meaning that which separates between the world and the hereafter. We say here there is a scientific reality which Allaah has indicated, that there is a partition between the flowing water of the river and the water of the ocean (as the former meets it) which separates between the two waters. Yes, now modern science affirms this, all praise is due to Allaah, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,  mentioned it in the course of the verse from the angle of (indicating) His benevolence and His kindness to mankind and that He alone is worthy of worship as opposed to those besides Him. And it is not binding that for every scientific reality or known matter you will find a basis for it in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, no, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was not placed for this..    <P>
Hence, the issue of "<i>(the Quran's) amazing aspects do not expire</i>" as it relates to the scientific explanation, it is made precise through the five conditions of the acceptance of explanation through opinion and if they are not fulfilled, it will be considered to be a futile, blameworthy explanation through opinion.</blockquote>     <P>
The five conditions alluded to by the Shaykh are found a few pages earlier (p. 13) and they are:    <P>
<ol><li> That it does not clash with what is related through the narrations from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and his <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> in a way that actually contradicts and does not reconcile.  <li> That it agrees with the context of the verse, what precedes it and what comes after it.  <li> That it is not mutally opposed to the linguistic indications of the words, since the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> was revealed upon a clear Arabic tongue.   <li> That it does not clash with the foundations of the Shari'ah even if it fulfils the prior three conditions.  <li> That it does not lead to supporting and aiding the people of blameworthy desires.  </ol>    <P>

<blockquote><div class='arabicquran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> &#1608;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1584;&#1616;&#1610; &#1605;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1585;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1606;&#1616; &#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1584;&#1618;&#1576;&#1612; &#1601;&#1615;&#1585;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1612; &#1608;&#1614;&#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1616;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1612; &#1571;&#1615;&#1580;&#1614;&#1575;&#1580;&#1612; &#1608;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614; &#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1576;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1586;&#1614;&#1582;&#1611;&#1575; &#1608;&#1614;&#1581;&#1616;&#1580;&#1618;&#1585;&#1611;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1617;&#1581;&#1618;&#1580;&#1615;&#1608;&#1585;&#1611;&#1575; <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div></blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote  class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'><b> And it is He Who has made the two seas (types of water) flow into each  other, one palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter, and He has set a partition and a prohibitive (restraining) barrier between them. (25:53) </b><img src='../images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah, Exalted is His remembrance says: And Allaah is the one who made the two seas to flow into each other, so He made one of them to mix into the other and poured it into (the other). And the foundational (meaning) of "<i>maraja</i>" is "<i>al-khalat</i>" (mixing). Thereafter, "<i>takhliyah</i>" (emptying, vacating) is also referred to as "maraj" because when a man vacates a thing until he engages (mixes) with another thing then it is as if he has mixed with it. And from (what gives the  meaning of "<i>maraj</i>") is the report of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), his saying to Abdullah bin Amr, "How will you be O Abdullah when you will be amongst the lowly ones amongst the people whose covenants and agreements will have become confusing (mixed)" and then he made his fingers (of either hand) to interlock (as an illustration), and by "<i>marijat</i>" he means mixed. And there is also the saying of the Exalted, (<span class='arb'> &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618;&#1585;&#1613; &#1605;&#1614;&#1617;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1580;&#1613;</span>) "<b>(So they are) in a confused state</b>..." (50:5), meaning mixed (disorderly)... and it is also said "<i>marajta daabbatak</i>" meaning you have let it loose to go where it wishes...  </blockquote>    <P>
Then al-Tabari quotes authorities to support this interpration of <span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1585;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1606;&#1616;</span> (making the two waters to flow, mix):    <P>
<blockquote><u>Ibn 'Abbaas:</u> (<span class='arb'>&#1582;&#1604;&#1593; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607;&#1605;&#1575; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1582;&#1585;</span>) He has made one of them to be to be conferred (i.e. flow) upon, over the other. <u>Mujaahid:</u> (<span class='arb'>&#1571;&#1601;&#1575;&#1590; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607;&#1605;&#1575; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1582;&#1585;</span>) He has poured out, spread  one over the other. <u>al-Dahhaak:</u> (<span class='arb'>&#1582;&#1604;&#1593; &#1571;&#1581;&#1583;&#1607;&#1605;&#1575; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1582;&#1585;</span>) He has made one of them to be to be conferred (i.e. flow) upon, over the other. </blockquote>    <P>
Then regarding the interpretation of (<span class='arb'>&#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1584;&#1618;&#1576;&#1612; &#1601;&#1615;&#1585;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1612; &#1608;&#1614;&#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1616;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1612; &#1571;&#1615;&#1580;&#1614;&#1575;&#1580;&#1612;</span>), al-Tabari says:    <P>
<blockquote>And His saying, "<b>This one is palatable and sweet</b>", palatable, meaning intensely sweet, is is said this is "maa'un furaatun", intensely sweet water, and His saying, "<b>And the other salty and bitter</b>" He says: And this one is salty, bitter, next to the intensely sweet, which are the rivers and rainfalls and the salty and bitter are the seas (oceans). And He means by this (to show) that it is from His favour upon His <a href='../tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, the greatness of His authority that He mixes the sweet sea water with the salty, bitter sea water and then prevents the salt from changing the sweet water from its sweetness thereby corrupting it, all through His <a href='../tags/ordainment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ordainment</font></a> and decree so that its corruption of it does not lead the salt flowing into it so that they (the creation) do not find water that they can drink when they require water. So He, lofty is His praise, said, (<span class='arb'>&#1608;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614; &#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1576;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1586;&#1614;&#1582;&#1611;&#1575;</span>), "<b>And He placed between them a partition</b>", meaning a (prohibiting) barrier that prevents each of them from corrupting the other (<span class='arb'>&#1608;&#1614;&#1581;&#1616;&#1580;&#1618;&#1585;&#1611;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1617;&#1581;&#1618;&#1580;&#1615;&#1608;&#1585;&#1611;&#1575;</span>), He says: And He made each one of them unlawful, prohibited upon its companion (i.e. the other water) that it should change and corrupt it.</blockquote>    <P>
Then al-Tabari cites authorities (Ibn Abbaas, Mujaahid, Qataadah, al-Dahhaak) for what he has just explained, all of them affirming that a) the sweet water is prevented and forbidden from mixing with the salt water and vice versa b) that one does not change the taste of the other. This is after the affirmation in the first part of the verse that the two waters are made to flow into each other (mix). After these citations al-Tabari then concludes:    <P>
<blockquote>Abu Ja'far says: We have chosen the (preferred) saying that we have chosen regarding the meaning of His saying "<b>and He has set a partition and a prohibitive barrier between them</b>" instead of the saying in which the one who expressed it says that its meaning is: "He made a barrier of the earth (i.e. land) or of dry (land) (between them)." This is because Allaah, the Exalted already mentioned at the beginning of the verse that He mixed the two waters (i.e. cause them to flow into each other), and "<i>al-maraj</i>" is "<i>al-khalat</i>" (mixing) in the language of the Arabs as I have explained previously.  So if the partition (barzakh) that is between the palatable and sweet of the two rivers and the salty and bitter was a piece of earth or dry land, then He would not have mixed the two waters, yet He has clearly informed that He has mixed them both (made them to meet and flow into each other). As for when each of the (two waters) are in a separate containing (basin) from each other, then there is no mixing, and there is no wondrous thing of which the people of ignorance (in this matter) can be informed and reminded, even if everything which our Lord has created (invented, brought about) is wondrous, and comprises the greatest of lessons, admonitions, and far-reaching proofs.</blockquote>    <P>
From this exegesis of al-Tabari we understand that whilst the two waters are made to mix, there is a partition which prevents the sweetness and saltiness of each water from being altered or corrupted by the other. This is something that many people can witness directly, first-hand, and it is a sign of Allaah's great mercy, favour and bounty.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What We Take From the Above</font>    <P>
<blockquote>What you will notice here is <u>the simplicity, certainty and beauty</u> in the explanation from the Salaf, the absence of <b>takalluf</b> (pretentiousness and unnecessary burden in explanation) and the absence of pretending to be intellectual and sophisticated and the absence of pretending to be rooted in the worldly sciences of the non-Muslims when you are clearly not (like todays 'scientific miracle' bandwagon peddlers). And if you were to present this to a non-Muslim it is not something he can reject or deny at this level. However, when we start seeing the 'scientific miracle' bandwagon peddlers going into all the detailed scientific verbage in order to impress non-Muslims, and relying upon the detailed studies and often incomplete theories (of the non-Muslims themselves) as to why what is observed is observed, they open themselves up for attack, because they have now moved from the basic simplicity and beauty of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and entered into the world of theorization and detail which carries with it a lot of speculation. This is because the non-Muslims try to explain all phenomenon through theoretical foundations that they have laid down for various fields, and in most cases, they do not truly and really fathom what is going on in as much detail as they woud like to, and hence, they bring assumptions or theories into play. When there exists this type of uncertainty and variation in possible explanations, then it allows room for debate and counterargument. Thus, if an ignorant Muslim comes along and starts citing this scientist or that scientist in relation to a particular phenomenon (attempting to correlate a very specific and detailed scientific explanation  to what is just a generalized indication in the Qur'an), he has really opened himself up for attack through the sayings of numerous other scientists who hold different theories and views as to why what is observed is observed at that level of detail. Hence, this approach requires a person to move from the simplicity, beauty and certainty of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> into the world of speculation and theory. So far from inviting Muslims to 'faith' these 'scientific bandwagon' peddlers are causing Muslims to doubt in their <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>.     <P>
What we take from the above then is that the intent behind such verses is to indicate the bounty, favour, power and wisdom in Allaah's <a href='../tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, which make man to reflect, ponder, receive admonition and come to the realization that none has the right to be worshipped in truth except Allaah alone and that the hearts do not find any true and real satisfaction except in this. As for claiming that these indications in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> precede modern science then that can sometimes be the case. But to make this matter (i.e. of miraculous 'foreknowledge') as a basis and broad framework for demonstrating the 'scientific miracle' then this is an innovated approach, innovated by the neo-Mu'tazilah, and all they have done is to follow the way of their ancestors, the Ahl al-Kalaam of old who made an innovated (corrupt) proof (<i>hudooth al-ajsaam</i>) as the foundation and cornerstone of their religion, and then allowed, for many long centuries until this day of ours, the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> and enemies to undermine this innovated corrupt proof of theirs and thereby attack Islam, the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Prophethood. As a result many of those who indulged in this kalaam fell into doubt (shakk) and confusion in their affair as happened with al-Ghazali and al-Aamidee and others,and this is a trait in general of those who enter into kalaam as is indicated in narrations from the Salaf. And in a similar way we see today confused and ignorant individuals like <b><a href='../tags/hamza-tzortzis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hamza Tzortzis</font></a></b> at one time arguing vociferously with the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> for years on end in certain affairs (like embryology), and then making a large turnaround, after being hammered and pounded by those very shrewd and cunning <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> - not unlike Ibn Sina (an extremely shrewd cunning kafir) pounding the mutakallimeen, even though he is more greatly misguided and they are closer to the truth, leading many of those mutakallimeen to become diseased with doubts and unable to escape the clutchess and throes of confusion and bewilderment, lamenting at the time of their death as to the wastage in their lives and renouncing the kalam whose oceans they traversed for a lifetime. Why? Because they never adhered to the way of the Salaf and used innovated, faulty goods which were in reality the used refuse of nations gone past. And this is what is happening today with ignoramuses who have never studied the Salafi <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or manhaj, brought in their philosophical baggage and have unfortunately been taken by the uninformed as 'vanguards of Islamic da'wah' but who lead the people in to doub) and confusion in their deen. We hope to write in more detail on this matter in some articles to appear shortly, inshaa'Allaah.  </blockquote>    <P>
