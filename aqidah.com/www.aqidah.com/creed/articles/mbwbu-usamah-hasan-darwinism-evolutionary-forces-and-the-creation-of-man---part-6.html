<font class='titleHeadline'>Audio of Lecture, "Islam and the Theory of Evolution"</font>    <P>
We received a link to the audio recordings of the lecture of Suhaib and Usamah Hasan (of 22/01/2011) this morning, and inshaa'Allaah what follows below is a loose transcription of it (around an hour and a half), some parts are quoted verbatim. We will add relevant comments where appropriate, and as we only have limited time, we will try to make only brief indications and observations, even though we would have liked to write more extensively.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Suhayb Hasan's Introduction</font>    <P>
Suhaib Hasan awaits his son's arrival and fills the gap in the meanwhile with the following:    <P>
<blockquote>Expresses surprise at such a large turnout, questions whether it is to support the truth or to create a disturbance. Usamah has not arrived yet, so he starts giving <a href='../tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a> of the mosque. He says people should know their position and recognize those who came first in da'wah to those who came later. He draws upon his connection to Shaykh Ibn Baz and the initial setting up of the mosque at Francis Road, Leyton to the one on High Road, Leyton...    <P>
Appears to be cut in audio...    <P>
Gives example of Shaykh al-Albani asked to leave university of Madinah because some complained about his views. He says that a person might say he was deviant because he was expelled because he was a deviant, but really it was just a difference of opinion in which some people did not like his view and did not tolerate it, and so they complained. He says a similar thing happened in Jordan, with complaints made against him and he was expelled and ended up in Syria. He equates this with the issue of Usamah Hasan's view on <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, and he says, "<i>This is why I have invited him here to let him explain his views, because his views are not understood ... or i think he was not able to express them in a way that could be understandable</i>..."</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comment:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>Shaykh al-Albani's particular views being alluded to above are in no way like the view of the ignoramus, follower-of-desires, Usamah Hasan. What a calamity in this introduction by Suhaib Hasan. It is completely out of place to use this argument here. The views of Scholars in the types of issues Suhaib Hasan is referring to are founded on revealed text itself. To give an example, the issue of niqab. Shaykh al-Albani has evidence from Sunnah, and those who oppose him have evidence from the Sunnah. In these types of differences we see each view has a foundation from a text, and then they differ on the conclusion to be reached from those texts. What Usamah is doing is taking an <u>unproven scientific theory</u> which is the foundation of the deen of the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> - [we would love to write a separate refutation just on Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> from the angle of sound reason and a scientific line of enquiry and show that <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> is nothing but a religion that itself needs metaphysical explanations and blind <a href='../tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>, and does not actually meet <u>the very criteria</u> that are claimed to distinguish between "science" and "pseudo-science", but that is for another series of articles, time-willing inshaa'Allaah] - so what Usamah is doing is expressing a view not because he found a revealed text which indicates to him that humankind came to be through Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> and descended through apes, but because he has believed in the correctness of a modern scientific theory, and then tried to merge it with revealed text and when we put all of the revealed texts together, we see they clash with the idea or claim that Aadam (alayhis salaam) came to be through <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>. So this has nothing to do with a permitted ijtihaad or a legitimate difference of opinion. This from Suhaib Hasan is following hawaa and defending the holding what is baatil upon hawaa.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Suhayb Hasan continues:    <P>
<blockquote>  He then speaks about many figures of the Indo-Pak subcontinent who are present in this country and who are from various groups who state that prayers behind certain factions like Deobandis, Wahhabis and so on in not valid and prayer is only valid behind them. Yet the truth to them is that the prayer is valid behind them only, behind their imaams only. He says that they have created a lot of dissension through these and that he does not agree with it and others should not agree with it. And that a greater fitnah is created when it is claimed that prayer is not valid behind others, and it has implications with respect to takfir, either the person is a kaafir or he is not, and if he is not the <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> returns upon the one making that claim. He uses this to draw into the issue of charging Usamah Hasan with <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, and states that he is a haafidh of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> who has been leading prayers here (at the mosque) and that he has arranged for Usamah to address the congregation. And that it may be possible that a person has fallen into ta'weel (faulty interpretation) which could be tolerated in Islam. This is the intention behind this meeting, to listen to Usamah Hasan's views and see if they are deviant or if they have room within the fold of Islam or whether other Muslims have preceded him in these views or not.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comment:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>As will be clear by the end of the lecture, it is Suhaib Hasan's intent all along behind organizing this lecture to vindicate his son and to give him a defense and a way out and to portray his position as being a ta'weel that is permitted, and thus something that does not warrant the response that it has already brought about. But in his introduction Suhaib Hasan is making three points. <u>The first</u> is using the <a href='../tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a> of the mosque and his early involvement in it as a means to argue (by implication) that he has a higher authority over others. <u>The second</u> is to use the example of Imaam al-Albani as a foundation to defend his own son. <u>The third</u> is to use the issue of the Barelwis who say prayer behind others (they call 'Wahhabis') is not accepted as a parallel to those who say prayer behind his son is not permissible.</blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Usamah Hasan's Lecture</font>    <P>
Usamah Hasan starts:    <P>
<blockquote>Apologizes for lateness, he states he is using a laptop and projector, and as he starts his speech there is some immediate commotion from the audience for a few minutes and is calmed down by some person.    <P>
... Usamah then speaks again and says opportunity for debate will be given later on. Then he states that his presentation is from a year ago, one that he gave at the Cheltenham Science Festival [April 2009] along with a Jew, Christian and Atheist (all professors). He says that through this material all the lies against him will be cleared.    <P>
He complains that Muslims are quick to make certain matters from the core of the <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> without there having been a discussion between all scholars and them all having agreed. He then asks the audience some questions (to illustrate), first whether the earth is flat. He says that for centuries Muslim scholars believed the earth was flat and he cites Tafsir al-Jalaalayn and a statement from al-Suyuti mentioning the disagreement between some Muslim scholars and the non-Muslims. He then states that around thirteen years earlier in that very mosque, he did a lecture using a globe to illustrate the earth is round and cited the verse regarding the two Easts and the two Wests.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comments:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>Firstly, the claim that all scholars must agree before a certain matter is included within the <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is false. Rather what counts is what is transmitted from the Salaf and what is held by Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, meaning those who follow the Salaf and everything which a Muslim needs to believe as part of his belief, in both a general and a specific sense has already been made clear, the Messenger (alayhis salaam) made it clear, and this clarity was transmitted by the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> to the rest of the Ummah. Certainly there are plain and evident things and there are obscure things which may not be known to the common-folk, but the issue we are speaking of enters into the realm of the agreed upon affairs and into those affairs which are known by necessity, because of the preponderance of knowledge in those matters amongst the scholars and the common-folk. Usamah's intent here is to apply this principle of his (contemporary scholars must have ijmaa' on an issue for it to be considered matter of aqidah) in a modern context, to allow him to exclude his view from the domain of <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. He is using the <i>argument through ikhtilaaf</i>, that since there is ikhtilaaf, then he is justified in his view, and this is not a sound proof, and in any case, there is no ikhtilaaf on the matter, since all the Scholars whose word is taken and trusted and relied upon throughout the Ummah are upon other than what Usamah is trying to innovate. It is true that shaadh (isolated, obscure) opinions can be very easily found for many affairs, and they are simply the last refuge of a scoundrel.    <P>
Sceondly, the examples Usamah starts using involve talbees (deception) in order lay down a general principle (which will become clear from him (and his father) as we proceed into the lecture), and the first of these is the issue of the earth's flatness or roundness. The Sahabah, Taabi'een, the Scholars of the Muslims are united that the earth is round. Shaykh al-Islam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> discusses this in numerous places in <i>Majmoo al-Fataawaa</i> and he cites from Abu al-Husayn al-Munaadee (d. 336H) from the Hanbali scholars consensus on this matter, and he (<a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) says this was a matter of agreement and he does not know of any of the Muslims who oppose this except for a small minority faction who disputed with the astronomers and only for the sake of argument said that it is permitted for the earth to be four sided (cube) or five sided (pentahedron), but without them denying it is actually round, and he says he does not know of anyone who said that (the earth is four-sided or five-sided) and actually believed in it seriously, except those to whom no attention is given from the ignoramuses (see 6/586 and also 25/195). Ibn Hazm (d. 456H) also cites consensus on this matter in <i>al-Fisal fil-Mila</i>l, and this has continued to be the belief of the Muslim scholars to this day. Now Usamah Hasan has been very conniving and deceptive in that he has pointed to <i>Tafseer al-Jalaalayn</i> and has used certain verses which mention the earth being "stretched out" and upon which some scholars made remarks that the earth is "flat" but they may not have seen this to clash with the earth being round at the same time, and even if there were some who claimed the earth is flat, then their saying is known to be false and not given any consideration or weight, such that it can be seriously treated as a "difference of opinion". Usamah's point in this is to try to deceive the audience and make this look like it is an issue of difference between the Scholars and that Muslim scholars did hold views clearly opposed to what is known through scientific observation. However, this is not the case, the Muslim's had consensus upon this because this is what they inherited from the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> and Successors regarding the meanings of the verses which are clear that the earth is round, and if there was any view contrary to that it was an insignificant, isolated minority view. And we know that it can always be the case that one or a number of scholars may, for circumstantial reasons, hold an isolated opinion. But this can never be used to start developing a general principle (aqidah issues have to be agreed upon, i.e. no ikhtilaaf) which is what Usamah is doing through these examples to help him cover his back.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>He then uses the example of the embryo being created from male and female fluid, and stated that for many centuries Muslim scholars believed that the embryo was created only from the male fluid and that this was taken from Aristotle and the likes of Ibn al-Qayyim and al-Ghazali repeated what was current (from the likes of Aristotle), and this view of Aristotle was that the female receives a sperm that contains a tiny copy of a human which is then lodged and then grows in the womb but without there being any contribution from the female.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comments:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>This example does not support Usamah. <u>Firstly</u>, the classsical commentators like Ibn Abbaas, Ikrimah, Rabee' bin Anas, al-Hasan, Mujaahid all explained that the <i>nutfah amshaaj</i> (76:2) is the combination of male and female fluids. Also we have to understand that we often get from these same commentators multiple layers of meanings which are all simultaneously correct and do not conflict with each other. For example, another interpretation of this same phrase is that it refers to a mixture of the dusts and stages (embryonic) through which a human is created and also represents the variation in the complexions of mankind. All these meanings are simultaneously correct. <u>Secondly</u>, to draw upon the views of certain scholars who might have expressed a view that is not entirely consistent with what is known from the classical commentators, or who spoke with certain details (fully formed human in a male sperm) which are really only subsidiary issues branching from the root of the matter, which is that both male and female fluids are still nevertheless involved, and even if they erred in this regard (in not affirming the role of female fluid), then the truth is to be followed and their views are not admitted. However, this requires investigation into what these Scholars actually said as we do not trust Usamah's citations and his ascription of views to authorities, and we have given good reasons and illustrations as to why in previous articles. People like Ibn Miskawayh, Ikhwan al-Safaa, al-Rumi, al-Jahiz, Ibn Khaldun and others (we addressed all these quotes in <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc>Part 3</a>), if we accept for argument's sake that they outlined Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> (which they clearly did not), simply theorized or made statements based upon the prevalent ideas of the time, and these ideas were already present by the time Darwin came along and he simply took those ideas to help give an explanation for the origin of species. And this explanation has not been proven till now, as in natural selection upon random mutations explaining the origin of man. This is not a "scientific" but <u>a metaphysical belief</u> that attempts to explain the fossil record, it has no observable or testable or verifiable proof for its main claim which is speciation through random mutations. We believe Usamah, just like many other deceived "intellectual" Muslims have been hoodwinked by what appears to be scientifically sound to them but which in reality is far removed from true objective science [again that is for another article].</blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>The next example he gives is whether the earth or the heaven was created first, and gives proofs for either view, and he states that from his background as an astronomer, the heavens and stars were created first.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comments:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>This issue is not in favour of Usamah Hasan either (in what he is attempting by citing it) because whether you say the earth was created first or the heaven was created first, <u>then both views have a basis in clear Qur'anic text</u> and it is just a matter of reconciliation. So we are able to say that the heavens and earth were fused, were then separated, then Allah created the earth and made it into seven layers, then turned to the heaven and split it into seven heavens, raising it high, and then spread the earth, and this order can be arranged from the various verses in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (combining between 41:9-13 and 79:27-30). Now if someone considers there is not clarity in this matter, and prefers one view or the other, he is speaking on the basis of a text which in his view explicitly asserts that particular view. This is very different to relying upon a theory that fundamentally is not found in the Book and the Sunnah, is not even proven upon either the scientific method (in a truly objective sense) and nor upon sound reasoning, then assuming its correctness, and then trying to fit the verses of the Book of Allaah around it.    <P>
Usamah's aim with these three examples is to show Muslim scholars held views some of which may have clashed with revealed texts and that assuming he himself is wrong, then no blame is to put upon him. This is his intent. And these three examples do not support him and are out of place. Rather, they are against him, and there is a bit of conniving in the examples he has chosen too.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>He then  mentions how he was given or came across a book by Harun Yahya called the <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> Deceit which led him to study the subject further and came to a different conclusion. He said he met other religious leaders who were also academic students or professionals and that they all came to the same conclusion, after they had studied the matter, and they all realized there were flaws in Harun Yahya's polemical works in this matter.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b><u>Comments:</u></b>     <P>
<blockquote>Many Muslims maybe influenced by Christian fundamentalist creationists and may have incorporated some of their arguments and may have had weaknesses in what they adduced as evidence, however to us, this simply means that they used weak tools and opposed sound reason. Just as we say that the Mutakallimeen (Mu'tazilah, Ash'aris) used weak tools to refute the  Philosophers and ended up getting in a sticky mess themselves with implications upon their <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. So we find a similar issue here were refutations have not been thorough and based upon sound principles. This only allows the Darwinist <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> to come back with a vengeance and to assert their authority more strongly, and this in turn confuses Muslims, the intellectuals amongst them too. Within this climate, many Muslims are faced only with two options, side with this lot (Darwinists), or side with that lot (anti-Darwinists), without realizing that there is baatil on both sides, even if one is fundamentally baatil (Darwinian atheism) and the other is trying to defend what is true with what is essentially baatil, and in the process falling into more baatil. Now again it looks like the crux of this matter of solving Usamah's problem and that of many other Muslim "intellectuals" is a detailed refutation of <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> upon sound reason. Note we said <b>sound reason</b>, and not "science" because there is a great fraud and con going that these arrogant <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> are playing which has hoodwinked people like Usamah Hasan and many other Muslims, and inshaa'Allaah that is also for another article, it would be a diversion here. As we have said <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> is just a religion disguised as science, and it fits into a much wider scheme of things, because it is a world-view that is essential and ideal for the materialist, socialist and political philosophies that Western nations are being run upon, and hence it is guarded with a vengeance, not upon objective science, but through a carefully arranged framework of layered protection which involves both money and politics. Within this context, it is inevitable that many "Muslim intellectuals" (going through secular institutions) are unable to see through it all and think what they have bought into is science when in reality it is not.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>He then speaks for a few minutes of the Muslim contribution to science and speaks of the tragedy that science declined amongst Muslims over the past centuries, leaving the Western powers and colonial powers to take over politically because they dominated these fields of knowledge.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This explanation is not the one we are taught in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah because the rise and fall of nations is not tied to scientific advancement, even though we do not deny the necessity of pursuing worldly knowledge that is of benefit to both the deen and dunyaa. But this is a Mu'tazili Qadari perspective that sidelines <a href='../tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="../tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a> and the kawnee and qadaree <a href='../tags/asbaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>asbaab</font></a> from the explanation of the reasons behind the rise and fall of nations, be they Muslim or non-Muslim. And there is no doubt that there is a methodology tied to this orientation and it is the Ikhwani methodology, that held by those who believe the Muslims need to forget their creedal differences and instead work on social, political and economic strength and unity. And so they seek power, strength and glory in that which it does not lie fundamentally, but is really only a subsidiary matter that is only of use and of benefit, once the true underlying causes (of strength, unity, authority) are present. So this is an Ikhwani poison coming through here.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues, and we now come to core of the matter, so we can bring most of it here as for his argument using the authorities he has mentioned, we have addressed them all in <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc>Part 3</a>, so you can refer that:    <P>
<blockquote>[Quality of audio decreases] He then gives a list of a few points of belief such as that Allaah taught man, Aadam was the perfect man, that the young earth teaching of the Christian (and Jewish) fundamentalists is wrong, and he says we do not have this problem. Then he moves on to Darwin and states that he is credited with the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, and he says that although he put a lot of ideas together through his research, he was not the first with such ideas, the first came from the Muslims, such as al-Jahiz (Kitab al-Hayawaan), and that he was the first to speak of "the struggle for existence" and the influence of the environment upon life.Then he moves onto Ibn Miskawayh and Ikhwan al-Safa that they spoke of a progression from the mineral world to the plant world to the animal world to the human world... He continues for a bit about these writings being published by contemporary scholars [could not catch the name]. He moves onto the Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun, and gives the quote from Ibn Khaldun (we quoted it in <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc>Part 3</a>) and uses it as a proof for transformation (of one species to another). From this quote he says that from observation whoever looks at gorillas and monkeys will see they are very similar to us [a little commotion from audience] and they also live in families and in the way they operate are similar to humans. Commotion breaks out at this stage, and Usamah continues to talk over the commotion addressing the audience. After two minutes or so Suhaib Hasan takes the microphone and shouts,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Please brothers, you wan't to make a brother kaafir [unclear] you want to exclude him from Islam so he can't the right to explain his position... if you are insulting you have no right to say to me 'We are not going to pray behind him', I am not going to allow such things to happen in this  mosque if you can't listen to him, if you have got no tolerance to even to listen to some idea then you have no right to be here in the mosque. [Commotion from audience]. I have said to you you have to listen, you have to listen first. If you don't want to listen you can leave... you have no right to speak here until you listen, if you are not going to listen, go away, leave this place!</blockquote>    <P>
Commotion continues for half a minute or so, Usamah takes the microphone and begins to explain that the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> does not contradict the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> but says the same thing as the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, that human beings were created, when creation began, with water, dust, soil and that this is what they (the evolutionists) say. [Some commotion] and some wrangling with audience. After half a minute or so he states again his point that     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>...the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> does not contradict the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and that if correctly understood the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> can support the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> and so there is no question of saying that if a person believes in the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> and that they are a kaafir, this is nonsense... </blockquote>    <P>
Someone from audience quotes the verse "<b>We have honoured the sons of Aadam</b>" (17:70) and Usamah says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>I've explained already, Aadam (alayhis salaam) was the first human being, the perfect man...</blockquote>    <P>
Then members from the audience seek clarification from Usamah asking whether Aadam had a mother and father ape and Usamah states:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Ok, I'll deal with that, according to <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, Aadam (alayhis salaam) had parents who were nearly human, who were very close to human.</blockquote>    <P>
Commotion from the audience. A portion of the audience decide to leave and Usamah says, "Whoever wants to leave, leave..." There is a discussion heard between two people in the audience, confirming what Usamah just said that Aadam (alayhis salaam) had parents that were "nearly human."    <P>
Then Usamah shouts:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>I did not say that Aadam (alayhis salaam) was the son of apes</blockquote>    <P>
And someone from the audience retorts:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>You said they were "nearly humans" ... he said Aadams parents are "nearly human" that is what he said I've got it recorded...</blockquote>    <P>
After some commotion, Suhaib Hasan takes the microphone and rebukes the audience for their behaviour and says that they are behaving the same way as the Americans did to the [Red] Indians (?) and then he shouts at the audience, "Please be quiet!" He then seeks to clarify what Usamah attempted to clarify (i.e. "I did not say that Aadam (alayhis salaam) was the son of apes"). [More commotion].    <P>
A person speaks and says that everyone should be civilized and let Usamah speak so that they can seek clarification from him as to what he means by "<i>nearly human</i>." He calls for everyone to sit down and to listen. Another person takes the microphone with a very strong accent, it's hard to make out a lot of his speech but it is similar to the person before him, he is asking for people to at least hear Usamah through, and he says Usamah said that he did not say Aadam was born of apes... then others from audience retort that he said "nearly human parents." </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Suhaib Hasan indicates that people are playing "Cowboys and Indians" in the mosque(!) The above brings us to the crux of the matter and we see that Usamah asserts "<i>according to the theory of evolution</i>" Aadam was born of "<i>nearly-human</i>" parents. Now from the rest of the lecture we see Usamah clearly validates this theory believes it, and thus what he is expressing is his actual view, that Aadam (alayhis salaam) was born of "nearly-human" parents.</blockquote></div>    <P>
The heated exchanges and discussion continues:    <P>
<blockquote>After some more wrangling and shouting a person takes the microphone and says let us ask Usamah one question and let him answer because that is what we all want to hear, he says the question is, "<i>Aadam (alayhis salaam), did he have parents and what exactly were those parents and what is your proof for it</i>." [Some commotion]. There is some clarification from others about the nature of the question that should be answered.    <P>
Usamah Hasan then speaks and he mentions poetry cited by Muhammad Iqbal [commotion from audience who want him to answer the question]... So he leads to his answer by mentioning the case of how the scholars used to believe the earth was flat or that the sun goes around the earth and then when modern science told them otherwise, they changed their views. Then he mentions the verse about the similitude between Jesus and Aadam (3:59) in that both were made from dust. He gives his understanding of the verse that the verse means Jesus was born through a natural process and that no one understands that he just came to be instantaneously, even if there was a miraculous element to it. He says the same is true for Aadam (alayhis salaam) in that it too was through a natural process. He then  justifies his stance by asserting that the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is scientific and is true and it is on this basis, he is saying what he is saying and that if it is proven wrong he will take that back... he mutters for a while with what is unclear ... and then says that he does not deny the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>His interpretation of the verse regarding Jesus and Aadam is wrong (see <a href=../index9228.html?kgmbv>Part 2</a> where we addressed it in more detail) and that verse is in fact against him not for him, and when we look at all the surrounding facts in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> about the story of Adam's creation, it cannot be reconciled with the idea that Usamah is presenting. You have really read <a href=../index9228.html?kgmbv>Part 2</a> mainly and <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc>Part 3</a> to understand this well.</blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>Then he addresses the issue of man descending from apes and says that he used to deny the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> too until he looked at the evidence, and he says that the belief that humans were descended from apes is just like saying the Prophets were made of a despised fluid, that there is nothing which entails any revilement upon them just because of this, and he uses this to analogize with the issue of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> from apes. Then he uses [a false] argument that if you find fault with the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> in that it entails <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> (for revilement upon the Prophets), then likewise you will fall into <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> for asserting what the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> states that humans (and Prophets therefore) originate from a despised fluid.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>This is a false analogy, because it is from <a href='../tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a> that states explicitly we are created from a despised fluid, yet it is not in <a href='../tags/allaahs-speech.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Allaah's Speech</font></a> that Aadam was born of "nearly-humans" or "ape-like beings" which is what Usamah is saying in reality, see next. </blockquote></div>    <P>
Usamah continues:    <P>
<blockquote>He then states that what he says about Aadam's parents is that they "resembled humans (<i>shibh al-insaan</i>)." He advises the audience to go to the Natural <a href='../tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a> Museum and then goes on to speak of modern humans who have existed for around 200,000 years and that the ape ancestors go back millions of years. He then says that you often hear on the news that fossils or skeletons (skulls) have been found of part apes and part humans which are millions of years old. [Some commotion]. Someone asks "Have we been descended from apes" and Usamah confirms, "I said Yes." Statements of takfir are heard, "Who want's to pray behind this kaafir?" [Commotion for a while].</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Here we come to another corroboration by Usamah, he used the phrase "shibh al-insan" (resembling humans) for the parents of Aadam, so really he means ape-like beings resembling humans, and he affirms that Aadam was created through parents who in turn are traced back to apes. There is a related question here about the creation of Eve and what implications Usamah's claim has upon the Qur'anic account. Eve was created from the nafs (self, soul) Aadam, as the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> says. So if Usamah asserts that Eve also came through Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, there is no way for him to reconcile this with the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> because if he argues that Eve was made from the same dust that Aadam originated from, then in this case, Eve did not come from Aadam (as the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> says) rather she came from an already existing population just as Aadam did. So both Adam and Eve were created from dust, and it would not be the case that Eve was created from the self of Aadam. So this poses a problem for Usamah's claimed reconciliation and we also addressed this point in <a href=../index9228.html?kgmbv>Part 2</a>. Then Usamah confirms that humans are descended from apes, and here he kind of contradicts himself when he tried to defend himself earlier when he said, "<i>I did not say Aadam (alayhis salaam) was the son of apes</i>" which strictly speaking is true, he did not say that, he said that he is the son of "nearly-humans" which one can only read too mean humans resembling apes. However, the issue is that he confirms Aadams descent is from apes as per Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>.</blockquote></div>    <P>
The exchange continues:    <P>
<blockquote>Then there are calls and shouts for a debate. About the commotion someone says "We are acting like monkeys at the moment", there are some shouts, and this continues for a while, and there are demands that some people in the audience be allowed to speak. There are calls for everyone to calm down. Suhaib Hasan takes the microphone and uses some emotional rhetoric and says "I am prepared to become like Uthman", he meant here that he is prepared to step down and withdraw and become a sacrifice, he says, that Uthman was besieged for six weeks, and that the people never listened to him, he tried to explain his position, and that even though he was the khalifah, no one listened to him and behaved just like the audience is behaving (i.e. in the mosque now), until Uthman was martyred. He then says that he will make the last statement and not say anything after that, he then says:    <P>

The second view, the theory that Usamah is advancing is that this is the same thing that Adam was created by the clay without disagreement and that he was created out of clay out of salsaalin fakhkhaar and was created with all these substances... but it took an evolutionary process... this is how Allaah mentioned about Eesaa (alayhis salaam) in that he was created in the womb of Maryam... so there was a process... and Adam came in a similar way as well. This is an opinion which I said at the beginning is a ta'weel by some of the scholars which he has mentioned..</blockquote>    <P>
He then says is there any room for this opinion for Usamah and this is what should be discussed. Someone from audience says, "Not in matters of <a href='../tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>... this is <a href='../tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> brother..."    <P>
Suhaib Hasan continues to say that there are two views and Usamah has the second view, that he has this ta'weel (interpretation) and can he become outside the fold of Islam because of this ta'weel and he says that this is a matter you can't decide, as this is difference of opinion. [Some commotion]. Suhaib Hasan continues to speak over and says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The second opinion is based upon science, those Ulamaa who know the science... [not clear] ... so I still think there is room for ta'weel</blockquote>    <P>

[Some commotion]. In the background Suhaib Hasan continues speaking and is heard saying, "it is a theory which may be right or it may be wrong" speaking about the theory being propounded. [Some more commotion]. Suhaib Hasan says that he holds the opinion of the Scholars, but that with respect to his son's opinion it comes  under a ta'weel, and that it can't be said he has exited Islam on account of it. [More commotion] and Suhaib Hasan continues to talk and asserts that there is room for this ta'weel. And someone says, "Not in the matter of <a href='../tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>." [Commotion] Suhaib Hasan continues talking but it is unclear. Then Suhaib Hasan likens this issue of ta'weel like that of the Ash'aris and Maturidis, and members from the audience contest this. Suhaib Hasan is haggled by audience. Then Suhaib Hasan says that it appears they want to kick Usamah Hasan out and the second target will be him, some of the audience deny that and there is much commotion. </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Comments:</b>    <P>
<blockquote><u>First</u>, This reveals to us the position of the father and the agenda of the father in this matter which is really to exonerate and vindicate his son and to present a defense for the son through the argument of ta'weel. And this is not really a scholarly position, <b>it is a siyaasi position</b>. And we do not know Suhaib Hasan except to have been upon an Ikhwaanee Siyaasee da'wah for the past twenty years and unfortunately, many a people have been blinded by him, merely because of a historical connection with the Saudi scholars (which means little if you are not actually upon their manhaj). A faction of people in this country have never ceased to rally behind this man, to defend him, to love and hate for his sake and to wage war against those who were with the Scholars who clarified truth from falsehood and spoke of Ikhwanis like Suhaib Hasan all those years ago who were upon a misguided wishy-washy da'wah where speaking truth in the face of falsehood  was looked down upon. As we said in our <a href=../indexc76a.html?bhqrf>previous article</a>, this type of behaviour <b>cannot be accounted for</b> merely by a <u>single unexpected random mutation</u> which just happened out of the blue on an unfortunate Saturday evening on Leyton High Road "<u>by necessity</u>" through "<u>the forces of natural selection</u>". Rather it has been evolving (as in cumulative random mutations [methodological innovations] over a long time) and this behaviour is just a culmination of a general orientation this man has been upon for a very long time and which has been observed from him in this country in his attempts to unite with al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen, constantly making his presence on the platforms of the <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, and flattering the <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> with honour and respect and so on, and asserting himself as a scholar of the land with his own particular vision and brand of a type of Islam that is suited for the Muslims (in his view).    <P>
<u>Second</u>, as for his claim that there are two views, a majority and minority opinion, this is following of hawaa (desires), since the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, indeed, the Ummah as a whole, only knows of one opinion, which is that Aadam (alayhis salaam) was the first human, born of no parents, and all of mankind is his offspring, and this is clear from the revealed texts, and hence it is a matter of belief. And then we have the verdicts of the Scholars like Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin and others, which contradict Suhayb Hasan's false claim. As we said before, in most issues you will always find isolated, minority views which may come either from a genuine scholar who has made a serious slip or it may just be the views of those who are not given any attention from the ignoramuses and the people of desires and who are not from the people of knowledge. The fact that Suhayb Hasan can take to the ambiguous statements of Ibn Miskawayh, the Persian Baatinee, the Ikhwan al-Safaa, al-Rumi, or Ibn Khaldun, in order to build a defense for his son through the argument of ta'weel (which is laughable), shows the following of pure hawaa.     <P>
<u>Third</u>, this is what the Shaykh, and Imaam, Muqbil bin Haadee (rahimahullaah) stated about Suhaib Hasan <u>around 13 years ago</u> when asked about his allegiance to the people of falsehood (from the Ikhwanis, Sufis and others):     <P>
<blockquote><b>As for the question of how you are to deal with him, then if you are able to prevent him from your masaajid, then prevent him so that he does not corrupt the hearts of your youth. But if you are not able to prevent him, then when he comes, you depart from the masjid and leave him to address the pillars in the masjid! Do not sit with a deviant, one who is astray. </b></blockquote>    <P>
Many never took this advice and remained attached to Suhaib Hasan upon that wishy-washy da'wah that scorned refutation of falsehood and looked down upon <a href='../tags/al-walaa-wal-baraa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</font></a> for the sake of the truth. And when a heart does not uphold the truth and tries to equate between truth and falsehood and maintains allegiance and closeness to the people of falsehood, then over time it blinds the heart, until the behaviour we are seeing now becomes within reach and within grasp of such a heart. As we said before, no scholar of the Sunnah ever flipped overnight due to a random mutation, and decided to justify the holding of a view that is <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> by claiming permitted ta'weel in the matter, upon the argument of their being "difference of opinion" on it! It just does not happen. There is definitely <u>an evolutionary process</u> that must have taken place before such behaviour becomes possible and plausible from a person...  </blockquote></div>    <P>
The discussion continues:    <P>
<blockquote>There is more commotion, some haggling, and there are calls for a debate. Someone who is not a native English speaker takes the microphone and says that Suhayb Hasan is with the jumhoor and that the second opinion is ta'weel through science, and if you disagree with Usamah Hasan you can disagree and leave. There is some commotion and argumentation. There are calls for a debate and a question and answer suggestion. After things settled down it appears that questions are being taken from the audience. The rest of the session is a series of questions answered by Usamah Hasan which lasts around 30-40 minutes, most of it does not add anything to what has appeared above except Usamah saying that he is simply holding the Qur'anic view in light of modern science. Usamah also explained that he has come across many Muslims leave Islam or doubt Islam due to science and so he has taken a position where he is trying to help these people by reconciling Islam with science, and his position on <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is from this angle. Within this session, he states that this issue (the theory of evolution) is not one that pertains to <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> but that people have made it into an <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> issue and this is just a matter of making tafseer of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> according to what we know. He repeats what he said earlier that certain scholars like Ibn al-Qayyim simply repeated the theories of past non-Muslim scientists (like Galen and Hippocrates). </blockquote>    <P>
We will comment on what is in this last paragraph through our summary notes and remarks on this whole episode.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Notes and Remarks</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> We have to get inside Usamah's mind here. Whilst he is asserting that which is clearly <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a> because it entails takdheeb of Allaah and His Messenger, his thinking is along the lines that there are many Muslims who have been put to trial in their deen by science. And this observation is true and we come across many people with many doubts of this nature and some even leave Islam, if not in a formal sense (as in officially repudiating it), but through the development of shakk (doubt). So his angle is that he has tried to help Muslims by reconciling between <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, after he has been convinced by the Darwinian theory of the origin of species. However, what works against Usamah is that he has displayed elements of conniving, dishonesty, false inference of proof, and following hawaa in order to build his case. When you analyze his case as it relates to his attempted merger between <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (see all previous articles) it is clear that he has no case at all.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> Usamah is just one of a growing number of "Muslim intellectuals" who are caught up in the firecross between three factions. Fundamentalist Christian creationists, Muslims who are influenced by some of their arguments and approaches, and the Darwinian <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a>. They clearly see that the fundamentalist creationists are wrong, and as for those Muslims, they have not refuted <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> appropriately and effectively, they use weak tools, methods, and reasoning and have goaded Muslims like Usamah to be polarized in the opposite direction to seek answers through a reconciliation between <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> (which appears to them to have a strong case) and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. So it is as if to them <u>it is either</u> <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> (which they don't accept as it is atheism) <u>or it is</u> fundamentalist Christian creationism (alongside which they put Muslims who may have followed those Christians in certain respects) and none of these two are viable to them, and so they simply use their own reason to find a middle path. And this is not dissimilar to how the Ash'arites and their likes were thinking back in the early period of Islam, in that it is either the Philosophers, or it is the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and there is no other way, and so they formulated a viewpoint which they considered to be intermediate, combining between the use of the conceptual tools of the Philosophers themselves with the texts of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah which lead them to a false, rejected type of ta'weel which is in fact <b>tahreef</b>. This leads us <u>nicely and perfectly</u> to the next point.    <P>
<b>Third:</b> Contrary to what Suhaib Hasan is claiming, his son Usamah is not making ta'weel, <b>but tahreef of the revealed texts</b> in order to make them fit <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>, just like the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots made tahreef of the revealed texts to make them fit the great idea and science of the day, which is proving the universe is originated through the proof of huduth al-ajsaam (argument through bodies and their incidental attributes). And just like the asl (foundation) of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> was that when aql (reason) and naql (revelation) conflict, the proof of aql (reason) is given precedence because it is qat'ee (definitive) whereas revelation in its interpretation is only dhannee (speculative) [even if in its authenticity it is qat'ee (definitive)], then so is Usamah's mashrab (orientation), it is from this angle, and for this reason you see him relying upon the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the Baatiniyyah and others in order to find justification for his view. In short,  they are all eating from the same bunch of bananas.    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> As for Usamah trying to exclude this matter from being an issue of <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> then it is false and this is because everything Allaah has revealed to us <u>is from His knowledge</u> (all the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is his knowledge), and thus we are obliged to believe in what is plain and evident and also upon whatever lawaazim follow on from what is plain and evident, all of that is from the <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. And from the plain and evident things are Allaah's names, attributes, actions, the books, messengers, prophets, angels, paradise, hellfire, previous nations and so on. Likewise the creation of Jesus (alayhis salaam) without male intervention and likewise the creation of Aadam (alayhis salaam). And likewise, when you put all of the verses together (which we have addressed in <a href=../index9228.html?kgmbv>Part 2</a> and <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc>Part 3</a>) the binding necessities following from such verses (which make the origin of man from apes invalid and inadmissible), that also becomes <a href='../tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. So this is a false argument from Usamah and he is speaking here of an issue in which all of the Ummah is united, regarding the unique and special creation of Aadam (alayhis salaam) as the first human without parents. All he has are the sayings of people (al-Jahiz, Ibn Miskawayh, Ikhwan al-Safaa, al-Rumi, and others) who are not accepted as scholarly authorities on religious matters. Further, the verse in (3:59) which likens  Jesus' creation to that of Aadam's is a refutation of him in that Allaah's argument is that if you wonder and marvel at Jesus' creation (from without male intervention) and you have deified him and worshipped him, then you have more reason to worship Aadam since he was born of no parents at all indicating the falsehood and the false argument of their worship of Jesus. Now even though the negation of parents is not explicitly stated in the verse, we know it is the laazim of the verse because those who were taught the intent of this verse by the Messenger, explained it in this manner, and they know better about Allaah's intent than ignoramuses of the 21st century struggling to reconcile between the science by which their hearts and feeble intellects have been put to trial and between the speech of Allaah, the Exalted. So this is the correct understanding of the verse and this is the intent (muraad) of Allaah, the Exalted, and this is what is conveyed from the Sahabah and Taabi'een, and this therefore demolishes Usamah's theory from its very foundations.     <P>
<b>Fifth:</b> An appropriate way to frame this  matter is like this: <b>Usamah is doing tahreef (not ta'weel)</b>, and we could say here that Usaamah is resembling the approach of the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, just as we have <u>Jahmites in sifaat</u>, and <u>Jahmites in qadar</u>, and <u>Jahmites in eemaan</u>, then Usamah is "being a Jahmee" towards the issue of the creation of Aadam - he is making tahreef of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (disguised as ta'weel by his father) after assuming the absolute truth of a modern theory and assuming its precedence over revealed texts (aql over naql), such that revealed texts have to be made to conform to it if they are in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or just dismissed if they are from the Sunnah (upon Mu'tazili arguments of aahaad and mutawaatir, or majaaz and haqeeqah and what is similar to that) - and we see all of this essentially coming together in Usamah Hasan, as in the type of approach and outlook, it can be characterized by what happened with the <a href='../tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and their offshoots, when they tried to combine with the science and philosophy of the day with the revealed texts, it has strong parallels.     <P>
<b>Sixth:</b> The reason why Usamah chose his words very carefully in describing Aadam's alleged parents as "nearly-human" is because he has to do a juggling act in trying to give <u>the appearance of conformity</u> to all the revealed texts on this matter. As we said before, when you put all the revealed texts together, they collectively falsify Usamah's claim, because when it comes to the nitty gritty details and the lawaazim (binding necessities) of those texts, the so called merger between Darwinism's explanation of origin of man and the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, is shown to be spurious. But he had to say "nearly human" to allow him to maintain that he believes Aadam is indeed the "first human." Hence, by the necessity of propping up his illusion, Aadam's alleged parents must be "nearly human" and not "actually human." This is sophistry and word play, just like the word-plays and sophistries of the Ahl al-Bida' we are familiar with from the Mutakallimeen (Jahmiyyah, <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, As'hariyyah). Usamah really means "<u>apes that have not become fully human</u>" and as much as he tried to wriggle and wrangle and peel bananas, the reality of what he is actually saying is that Aadam's parents were the last stage of apes closest to the beginning stage of perfect humans and in whose genes there must have been a "much larger than usual" degree of mutation to allow the transition of "nearly-human" to "fully-human" in just one generation! And you have to remember the quotes from Ibn Khaldun and the Baatinee Ismaa'eeliyyah in this regard, that is where he is coming from, and you would do well to read <a href=../index1ed1.html?mklcc >Part 3</a> in particular which deals with those quotes. With this bit of conniving and play with words, Usamah Hasan can maintain that he believes Aadam to be the first human, endowed with a spirit, reason, thought, reflection and intelligence. This does force Usamah into a very difficult position in that he has to deny these qualities from the alleged parents of Aadam and Eve to the degree that renders them from the highest stage of ape-like beings (i.e. "<i>nearly humans</i>") without having fully entered into the stage of perfect humans. Upon what has preceded, <u>the reality of the matter with Usamah</u> is that Aadam and Eve were in fact born of <u>ape-like parents</u> who had not reached full humanity. And we seek refuge in Allaah from such <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, as this is takdheeb of Allaah and His Messenger and is a view that fundamentally clashes with the combination of all revealed texts in this regard which collectively falsify and render spurious such a claim.    <P>
<b>Seventh:</b> There are other people who have attempted to reconcile <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> with the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> by saying that whilst man in general descended from apes, Aadam was unique and exceptional in that He was created by Allaah in a special way (i.e. that outlined in the Qur'an) but humans descended from apes and there were already human or human-like beings on earth prior to Aadam. This also implies takdheeb of Allaah and His Messenger (alayhis salaam), since it would mean denial that Aadam is the first human and also a denial that mankind today have all descended from Aadam, since Allaah refers to all of mankind as "Banee Aadam" often in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (see 7:26, 27, 31, 35,  7:172) and addresses mankind as the offspring of a single soul and its mate (4:1). There also occurs in the hadeeth of Muslim and others (see <a href=../indexc76a.html?bhqrf>Part 5</a>), that when Allaah fashioned Aadam in Paradise and left him as He willed to leave him, Iblees came and saw that he was hollow and would not be able to restrain or control himself (as in, the nature of his constitution). This shows that mankind (Aadam's offspring) are created upon certain constitutions, and some are mentioned in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, such as being <u>weak</u> (4:28), being created of <u>haste</u> (21:37), <u>oppressive</u> and <u>ignorant</u> (33:72), <u>impatient</u> (70:19) amongst others. Collectively, these texts reconciled and put together show that Aadam is indeed the first human, and Allaah created him upon that form and that constitution, and this is the nature and constitution of all of his offspring, as in these traits and characteristics manifest in them as a whole, even though amongst them are those who are the best of creation and the most noble and honourable, with the loftiest of manners (the Prophets and Messengers). Thus, anyone denying these texts of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> or the lawaazim (what is necessitated) by these texts, upon knowledge and intent, has made takdheeb of Allaah and His Messenger and has fallen into <a href='../tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
