<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Attempts have been  made by Usamah Hasan over the years to merge the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> with <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>. To address Usamah Hasan fully would require a lengthy treatment, which time does not allow, so the easiest thing to do is to just make commentary on the various statements he has made, with the hope that the reality of his orientation and call becomes clear through it.     <P>
<blockquote>In his agenda, Usamah Hasan is drawing upon the writings of the likes of the  <u><a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a></u>, the <u>Ismaa'eelee Shee'ee Baatiniyyah</u> (Ikhwaan al-Safaa) who tried to merge the Shar'iah with Greek Philosophy and who worked in almost perfect secrecy in the third and fourth centuries after hijrah to spread deviation (such as worshipping of prophets, saints and graves) amongst the Muslims. Also, the likes of <u>Rumi the Ittihaadee Extreme Sufi</u>, and neo-Mu'tazili thinkers like <u>Muhammad Iqbal</u>. In fact, it appears that Usamah Hasan is not dissimilar in purpose to those Baatiniyyah of the fourth century hijrah who were attempting to reconcile Islam and the Sharee'ah with <u>the science of the day.</u>  Today, Usamah Hasan is presenting the idea that there is compatibility between neo-Darwinism and Islam, and that <a href='../tags/belief-in-allaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>belief in Allaah</font></a> can be merged with <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>. He asserts that his father, Suhaib Hasan, is defending <u>the right</u> of Usamah to arrive at "independent conclusions." Indeed, it has reached us that Suhaib Hasan is  now invoking curses upon those who did not pray behind his son (Friday 14/01/2011).</blockquote>    <P>
We will take from his numerous writings or interviews in the past two or so years in which his thought is presented. Note that there is no particular order to this, and is being done <i>ad hoc</i> due to time constraints. Inshaa'Allaah perhaps on a later date a more orderly and organized piece can be written. For now, we want to just pin-point where he is coming from and put it into context for further analysis. Our aim here is to expose exactly <u>how and where</u> Usamah Hasan is "<u>positioning</u>" himself in a broader context.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Guardian Article</font>    <P>
Usamah Hasan wrote an article for <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/religion.darwinbicentenary>the Guardian newspaper</a> dated 11th September 2008, he said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>Knowledge regained</b>  In contrast to their forebears, modern Muslims have a childlike view of science, especially <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>. This needs to change    <P>
Professor <a href='../tags/richard-dawkins.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>richard dawkins</font></a> recently said that most Muslims were creationists, and their children are taught that the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is wrong, which causes a huge problem in schools.    <P>
He's largely correct, and the Muslim world desperately needs to debate the matter properly without fear, since science can neither prove nor disprove God.</blockquote>    <P>
We say:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> Regarding his saying "<b>Knowledge regained</b>", then the knowledge which is praised in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and which is beneficial from every single aspect, in other words is inherently beneficial, in and of itself, is the knowledge of Allaah's Names, attributes, actions, the pillars of worship, the obligations, the prohibitions, the morals, the manners and so on. <b>It is the knowledge of the deen</b>. This is the explanation of the <a href='../tags/companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Companions</font></a> and the Taabi'een. But this meaning of <i>knowledge</i> is not Usamah Hasan's intent through this title. He has something else in mind. The secular, worldly knowledge is not inherently praiseworthy, and is not inherently beneficial. It's benefit, praiseworthiness or worth is connected to <u>the objectives and goals behind it</u>, and it can be classified as beneficial or harmful depending on its content and what it is used for. And we, as orthodox Muslims, put this knowledge <u>in its proper place</u> and every worldly knowledge which can be harnessed to bring about tangible benefit, religious or worldly, then the Muslims are encouraged to investigate it, but we do not make this an individual obligation and nor do we base any religious call, reformative, or otherwise around it. This is because within an Islamic world view, we have a different understanding and explanation of the rise, progress, success and fall of nations and civilizations, and thus there are elements which comprise this world view that would be absent in a secular world view. Nations and civilizations have come and gone, raised and lowered, honoured and humiliated, destroyed and annihilated, alongside what they possessed of the greatest of sciences of the day. So the priorities as it relates to worldly knowledge are different in the two views. Again, this does not mean that from the point of view of a nation, as a whole, that we do not actively seek benefit through worldly types of knowledge, rather, this is something desired and sought. However, Usamah Hasan has made this knowledge [and in particular Darwinian evolutionary theory] as a basis for scorning and ridiculing the Muslims, looking down upon them and treating them as backwards.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The Muslims, wal-hamdulillaah, are neither backward and nor disadvantaged and nor scientifically inadept for not accepting [as is claimed] that Allaah <u>chose</u> to create Adam (alayhis salaam) through the result of generations upon generations of the sexual activity of the "common ancestors" of apes and men in whose germinal (reproductive) cells mutations took place leading to "improvements" over time, until the perfect man came to be.</div>    <P>
Further, from this type of [secular, worldly] knowledge is that which if a person knew, would not really benefit him in anything and would have no real impact on his life and hereafter, and nor upon his intelligence. Thus to know exactly how Adam came to be, meaning, with scientific detail, then besides this being <u>pure speculation</u>, [and beyond what we have been specifically informed of in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and Sunnah], it is of no inherent benefit, and had there been any benefit in this, then Allaah would have given us additional knowledge regarding it, <u>above and beyond</u> what He has already informed us of. Thus to criticize the Muslims as having a "childlike" view of science in relation to <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> - [in light of what we have just said regarding the Islamic ruling on this worldly knowledge in the first place] - indicates that this individual has much more up his sleeve than meets the eye. He has broader designs, perhaps like those Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah a thousand years ago who wanted to merge the Sharee'ah with <u>the sociology, philosophy and science</u> of the day. You must understand the point we are making here, which is that Allaah has already informed us of what is sufficient for us to know about our humble beginnings [dust in its origin for Aadam and a lowly-despised liquid in subsequent transmission and proliferation of his offspring, see 32:7-8], and what is beyond that is superfluous. And thus, to scorn Muslims for not going beyond that and entering in the realm of what is <u>speculation</u> shows that the use of this paltry and insignificant issue [of Darwinian Evolution] to scorn Muslims and ridicule them for not being "scientific" indicates a much greater perversion lurking in the background. Further, as we shall demonstrate in due course inshaa'Allaah, what Usamah Hasan is actually calling to is falsafah (philosophy) and has little to do with science in reality.    <P>
<b>Second:</b> Regarding his saying,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Professor <a href='../tags/richard-dawkins.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>richard dawkins</font></a> recently said that most Muslims were creationists, and their children are taught that the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is wrong. He's  largely correct [i.e. Dawkins], and the Muslim world desperately needs to debate the matter properly without fear.</blockquote>    <P>
<u>Every child is born with an innate belief in a creator</u> as it is born upon <b>the fitrah</b>. Allaah created mankind upon the fitrah (natural, innate disposition) (see 7:172, 30:30) and then He sent Messengers whose call was directed at the fitrah primarily (14:10) - in other words the Messengers appealed to the fitrah first and foremost in calling to <a href='../tags/belief-in-allaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>belief in Allaah</font></a>. The fitrah recognizes and knows that every muhdath (originated thing) must have an originator (muhdith), and each soul was drawn out and made to testify itself that it has a lord and originator (7:172). Thus when the Messengers were sent, the fitrah of the people recognized the truth of their call, with the exception of those who fitrah was corrupted or in whom arrogance and the likes prevented submission, in knowledge and deed, to Allah's right to be worshipped alone. In addition, the Messengers also brought rational evidences, the purpose of which was not merely to demonstrate the existence of a creator (which is already known and deeply-rooted in the fitrah) but proving the truth of worshipping none but Allaah alone. Where fitrah has been corrupted, then reason is used, but otherwise, fitrah is the asl (foundation) in the call of the Messengers. As such, all Muslims with sound uncorrupted fitrah know, <u>instinctively</u>, that Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is falsehood, since it denies the most obvious and plain truth there is, known through both fitrah and reason, that every muhdath (originated thing) has a muhdith (originator). Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> states that all life emerged through small improvements amongst oceans of errors, and unfavoured species perished whilst the strongest survived, and through this process speciation occurred, and all of this occurred <u>without a creator</u>. Thus, for Usamah Hasan to call for a "debate" on this issue and to agree with the sentiments of an atheist (or agnostic) [whose alternative to theism is Darwinism] is a call to debate and corrupt the very fitrah upon which Allaah created mankind [for the reasons to be outlined in this series of articles].  Yet Allaah said, "<b>Let there be no change in Allaah's creation</b>" (30:30) which the early classical orthodox Sunni exegetes explain to mean "<i>Let there be no change in the deen</i>", which means change in the monotheism, the upright religion (Haneefiyyah) upon which mankind was created, and for which their constitution (in terms of knowledge, feeling and inclination) was crafted, and to which it is naturally inclined, and all of that is founded upon the innate knowledge (in the fitrah) that every soul has a Lord that brought it into existence.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>We have to be careful here and not ascribe to Usamah Hasan that which he does not hold. He is not calling to a debate about Allah's existence or to deny it, or to validate the element of <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> that implies there is no creator, since he is attempting to <u>merge</u> <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> <u>with</u> belief in a creator. You have to remember, Usamah Hasan is already the first species in <a href='../tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a> that is <u>a naturally selected recombinant</u> of Wahhabism and Sufism, as he has announced himself, that he is a "<u>Wahhabi Sufi</u>." Having himself been the unique product of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> in this regard, his next stage is to evolve into <b>a Darwinian Muwahhid</b>, and Allaah knows best what random mutation comes after that, but if you take careful note and reflect upon the piece of poetry he cited from al-Rumi (the Sufi) in his Cheltenham lecture, you couldn't be faulted for saying "<b>a transmigrating Darwinian Ittihaadee</b>."    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/wahabi-sufi-evolution.jpg border=1 hspace=10  vspace=6 align=left border=0> We started seeing the <u>evolutionary merger</u> of Wahhabism with Sufism back in July 2006, in Didsbury Mosque, when the father, through <i>natural selection</i>, was sitting on platforms right next to those who actively promote <i>istighaathah</i> (seeking rescue) from the dead (outright plain Shirk) and who deny there is a Lord above the Throne, Jahmite Sufis like Muhammad Ibn Adam <u>al-Kawthari</u>. The genotype no doubt has been passed on through the germinal cells. We are also seeing here a manifestation of the Darwinian theory of mutations, where small mutations (over lengthy periods of time) eventually lead to "improved" new species (a bit like how sunnah evolves into bid'ah).     <P>
In any case, we have to be careful about what we ascribe to Usamah Hasan, he is not advocating the atheistic element of <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>, he wants to reconcile between what appears to be the science of it with the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. But our point is that in opening <u>the particular door he wants to be opened</u>, along with sharing the sentiments of <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> like Dawkins towards the teaching of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, and along with the way he is coming across, it is clear he wants to lead the people towards such a direction [of corruption in the fitrah], whether he realizes it or not, and the situation is actually worse than what you might think when you read the points below. </div>    <P>
<b>Third:</b> So when Usamah Hasan says, citing and agreeing with Dawkins:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>...their children are taught that the theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is wrong, which causes a huge problem in schools. He's largely correct [i.e. Dawkins], and the Muslim world desperately needs to debate the matter properly without fear, since science can neither prove nor disprove God.</blockquote>    <P>
Then this is a call to what Allaah prohibited, and it is a call to the  corruption of the fitrah, and it is a call to changing the deen of Allaah. This is only a matter of debate for those whose hearts have been poisoned with doubt (shakk) about what Allaah revealed in regard to Aadam (alayhis salaam). So to draw the Muslims and their children into debating "<a href="../tags/darwinism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Darwinism</font></a>" in such a broad manner, is inviting them to subject their fitrah to  potential corruption, consider the statement of Dawkins (29th September 2008):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Before Darwin came along, it was pretty difficult to be an atheist, at least to be an atheist free of nagging doubts. Darwin triumphantly made it EASY to be an intellectually fulfilled and satisfied atheist. That doesn't mean that understanding Darwin drives you inevitably to <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a>. But it certainly constitutes a giant step in that direction.</blockquote>    <P>
Again, we should make it clear that Usamah Hasan is not affirming the atheistic element of <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>, but he is <u>opening a door</u> for which there is <u>absolutely no need</u> for it to be opened (in light of the first point above and what is to follow). At the same time we should point out that the caution being advised here is not because Muslims are "scared" of "losing their faith" or anything like that, <u>by Allaah never!</u> It is through pure conviction, in fitrah, aql, naql and nadhar, that Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is a scientific con whose "evolutionary forces" <u>presuppose</u> the presence of complex genetic material, and it is driven more by psychological needs [it is the only alternative that <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> can present to challenge the fitrah] than it is by sound reason. Darwinists need to explain or prove how <u>complex genetic <i>information</i></u> appeared from the interaction of dust, gas, water and electricity, and what are the chances of this occurring and how long it would take statistically for such genetic material to come about which contains <u>structured information</u> and to have inherent meaning within itself. When you look in to current research in this area (called abiogenesis), it is all speculation, doubt, conjecture, and it is really a type of bending over backwards to fill this gap of knowledge. As for the <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> that is commonly spoken of (i.e. Darwinian), that is a different subject area, and it actually rests and relies upon abiogenesis (life arising from pure matter). In reality, its like an elephant being supported by a matchstick. But they don't want you to know or see that a matchstick is all they have to try to hold it up. Thus, they focus your attention just on the elephant alone.    <P>
Now Usamah Hasan's thing is - after believing in the validity of neo-Darwinism - he puts the creator into the equation and says "this is how Allaah did it", and he has no proof for that, neither from revelation nor from reason. Usamah Hasan feels embarassed that Muslims are sceptical of or reject Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> and he feels this is making Islam look backward in the eyes of a scientifically advanced non-Muslim audience. In reality it is nothing but an inferiority complex that "Muslim intellectuals" like Usamah Hasan develop because of the intellectual environment they are operating in. This is not a "science" thing, its actually more of a personal, psychological thing, which Usamah Hasan is "externalizing" on to the Muslims. Further, if he is calling to debate, then much debate has already taken place and there are Muslims and their scholars - [as well as hundreds of credible non-Muslim scientists, both religious and non-religious] - who have spoken from both reason and science in this matter. It is <u>for this very reason</u>, that Muslims are not convinced and do not want their children being subject to inherently atheistic theories.    <P>
The matter of causality in creation and environmental effects upon plants and mammals (as in microevolution) is one matter and the claim that Allaah created Aadam (alayhis salaam) upon Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> [Usamah's claim] then that is a separate matter, and Usamah has no evidence for this, neither from revealed text, nor fitrah, nor reason (as will be clear inshaa'Allaah), and we will see in his attempts to draw upon verses of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the scraps he has managed to scavenge from the <a href='../tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah and others.    <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> Regarding his saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>...and the Muslim world desperately needs to debate the matter properly without fear, since science can neither prove nor disprove God.</blockquote>    <P>
Orthodox Sunni Muslims - in opposition to the Ash'arites and their likes - affirm the causality in things, and the inherent strengths or faculties (quwaa) in things, believing that Allaah placed inherent qualities in things through which effects are produced, and this is known through both reason and revelation. Further, orthodox Sunni Muslims do not deny that environmental factors have effects which in turn can bring about generational changes, be that in plants or animals or humans. So the idea of "<a href="../tags/evolution.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Evolution</font></a>" in this sense, as in <u>change and transformation within a species (microevolution)</u> through environmental factors is not denied and this exists for sure. This is not the subject of debate. What is contended is whether the process [outlined in Darwinian evolutionary theory] can account for Aadam (alayhis salaam). Muslims take an approach to this matter that is based upon fitrah (innate disposition), aql (reason), naql (revelation), and nadhar (introspection, science), much to the ignorance (and arrogance) and dismissal of Usamah Hasan. But this discussion is for another place, here we are just putting Usamah Hasan into perspective. In presenting the issue as "<i>Muslims are backward and childlike by denying Darwinism</i>", then Usamah Hasan's <u>intent</u> and <u>desired scope of discussion</u> goes beyond what we have just pointed out. Meaning, he is not happy that Muslims merely accept that Allaah has put causality in things, environmental effects, changes, transformation, and that there is indeed a trend called "microevolution." He wants more than that from them. Putting the Ash'arites and their deviant kalam theology and rejection of causality to one side, Usamah Hasan wants to draw the Muslims into a matter <u>above and beyond</u> what we have just mentioned, and he is scorning them for not believing wholeheartedly in <u>his</u> theory (Allaah created Aadam through Darwinian evolution). He should know that it is precisely fitrah, aql, naql and nadhar that is the basis of the rejection by the Muslims and it is just <u>pure arrogance</u> on his behalf to make it look as if he is some special intellectual whose got it all sussed and the Muslims are just backward and unscientific who  "haven't got over <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> yet."    <P>
<b>Fifth:</b> So what Usamah Hasan wants to do is to move Muslims into another domain, into the realm of <u>speculation</u>, rather plain falsehood, <u>both from a religious and scientific perspective</u>, in claiming that Allah's creation of Adam (alayhis salaam) was the product of [millions, billions, trillions etc.] of iterations until there emerged a complete human endowed with reason, and that in between  (<u>the stage of</u>) raw minerals, water and dust to (<u>the stage of</u>) the first simple cell to (<u>the stage of</u>) the complete human (and all lesser life forms such as plants, animals, apes and so on), there was a selection process which favoured certain species who were fit enough to survive, meaning that <u>perfection</u> and <u>completion</u> was a gradual thing involving trillions and trillions of incomplete, inferior or worthless life forms that went to waste, and from which a very small minority had the benefit of being "naturally selected", remained and progressed  until <u>perfected forms of things</u> emerged, from which is Aadam (alayhis salaam). He wants Muslims to enter into debates about this explanation of how life emerged and to combine it with Sharee'ah texts and this is his call, and he deems the Muslims' refusal to acknowledge this and to enter into his call as a sign of being scientifically backward. As we have said, both reason and revelation reject this explanation, and this is not the point to start bringing evidences for this, we just want to make general observations, and show what Usamah Hasan is actually calling to and what he wants to open up for debate. In order to present this particular view, deep inside his soul, this scoundrel knows that the revealed texts are not with him either, rather, he is following <u>his own lusts and desires</u>, as we shall see inshaa'Allaah, when we look at his pathetic attempts to adduce arguments through Qur'anic texts.     <P>
<b>Sixth:</b> His saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>...since science can neither prove nor disprove God... No wonder then that the theory is opposed by some religious elements, especially those that are ignorant of science</blockquote>    <P>
Is the saying of an ignoramus who has lost his reason (aql). Note that what the first sentence is really saying, <u>when we reduce it to its core</u>, is that science cannot prove God. If you state that <u>science cannot prove God</u>, adding that it can neither disprove God, it <u>does not</u> overturn the first statement, that it can't prove God, since that is an absolute judgement you just made. Upon this, if science cannot prove God whose existence is the most plainest and obvious of truths in fitrah and aql, then how can science prove what is much more obscure than that, which is Aadam (alayhis salaam) being created through Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> [which <u>theorizes</u> that natural selection and mutations explain the origin of all life]? If you dismiss that the tool and instrument of science can actually prove God (which is what his statement above really means and reads), then to call Muslims backwards and child-like for not using this same science [which is not able to prove God] to arrive at the certain conclusion that Aadam (alayhis salaam) was preceded by generations upon generations of the sexual activity of baboons and apes (and that is a lot of baboons and apes), whose germinal (reproductive) cells underwent millions or bilions or trillions of mutations in all that time, which, coupled with environmental factors, led to Aadam (alayhis salaam), a matter which <u>in its obscurity</u> pales into <u>insignificance</u> compared to the manifestness of the issue of Allaah's existence <b>[see next paragraph]</b>, then it is clear that <u>this buffoon</u> is not operating upon either reason or scientific enquiry, and his attacks upon Muslims are but the ravings of a lunatic, lost in mind, and he, in his confusion, is similar to that "<i>fat ox from Aamid, of contemptible worth</i>", to borrow the poetry of Ibn al-Qayyim. Then he says later, criticising "religious elements" as being ignorant of science because they oppose this "theory", and he still refers to it as a "theory." He scorns Muslims, reviles them, calls them backward for not using science [which can't even prove God according to him] to accept and believe in what he himself refers to as a "theory." This shows that there is more to this individual than meets the eye, and it is not 'aql but hawaa, and it is not science, but philosophy.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>We see the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> uses a type of evidence that is <u>far superior</u> in its method than all kalaam and philosophical arguments. The <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> establishes a <b>wujood 'ayni</b> (an actual specific direct existence whose evidence is through what is sensory, tangible) [as opposed to a <i>wujood mutlaq</i> through abstract considerations] and it does this just like forensic science is used to deduce things. This is because this creation and all that is in it is from the handiwork of Allaah, the Exalted. And that which is <i>maf'ul</i> (done) gives evidence to the <i>fi'l</i> (the deed, act) which gives evidence of the <i>faa'il</i> (doer) and His attributes. And this is the way that Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) demonstrates. So if we say <b>science</b> is observing the creation and making deductions (with <u>sound uncorrupted reason</u>), then Allaah, the Exalted has ordered in many places in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to observe and reflect upon the universe, the human soul and body, how man is formed and shaped in the womb, to look at the alternation of the night and day, and so on,  and through that, come to the realization of the truth that there is none which has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone, which <u>comprises by default</u>, the belief in the existence of a Creator. And each person is able to indulge in this to the level of his knowledge, intelligence and ability. A scientist at his level of "science" and the layman at his level of "science". And such observation and reflection corroborates, augments, supports <b>the fitrah</b>, which is <u>the real foundation</u> in any case. Thus, Usamah Hasan's claim that "science cannot prove God" is false. Science is merely a tool, and it is such that anyone can prove anything with it, if they so wish. Use of science is always with prior theoretical considerations which determine what it can and cannot prove. Usamah has simply been poisoned by the <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> and their outlook in these areas, they operate upon a corrupted fitrah, and thus "science can't prove God" and it can't prove God to them because they are operating upon a narrowly-defined, rigged definition of "scientific enquiry" that excludes what can be arrived at through sound reason.</div>    <P>
<b>Seven:</b> This next saying of his reveals a lot, and shows that this man is a mulabbiss, kadhhaab:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Snazzy websites, videos and books produced by fundamentalist Muslim "creationists" such as those at www.harunyahya.com, are obscuring clear scientific thinking.</blockquote>    <P>
Now, we may not necessarily agree with and condone everything that might come from other Muslims who might be involved in the debate about Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> (as they may have certain doctrinal orientations that may influence the nature of how they refute, and further their approaches may not all be valid and sound), however this statement Usamah Hasan has made, and the language he is using shows a type of treachery. Look at how he refers to Muslims who refute <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> <u>because it is essentially an atheistic, secular, materialistic belief, and is the bedrock of contemporary atheism</u>. To Usamah Hasan, they are "<i>fundamentalist Muslim creationists</i>", look at this language, this talbees, this deception in words, and turning of the realities. These are Muslims who are combatting <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a> you buffoon and ape! And if you were truly honest and scientific, you would not be making such absolute, generalized, oppressive, slanderous statements like these against Muslims, whilst sharing in the sentiments of <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> [agnostics] like Dawkins against them. You would at least have the honesty to acknowledge <u>why</u> these Muslims have a problem with <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> and what is motivating them to debate it and reject it. <b>Further, which is the greater of the two?</b> A Muslim refuting <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a> and [upon Usamah Hasan's perception] falling into error as to how Allaah created Adam in the process of refuting this <a href='../tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a>, or an atheist being essentially correct [upon Usamah Hasan's perception] in explaining how man developed through Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a>, yet denying a creator. So which of these is more greatly misguided and is more worthy of rebuke. And which of the two is more worthy of support and positive sentiment? You would think from Usamah Hasan's statement above that it is these "fundamentalist Muslim creationists" who are worthy of all rejection and who are not thinking scientifically and are the enemies of scientific enquiry, and that it is the likes of Dawkins who are "largely correct" in lamenting that children are taught the theory of Darwinian <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> is wrong, whilst noting that the likes of Dawkins rely upon nothing but the very particulars of this theory of <a href='../tags/evolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Evolution</font></a> in arguing that God is a "delusion."  So look at this <u>treachery</u> and look at the language being used and see where his sympathy lies. Usamah should know that a single Muslim who refutes <a href='../tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> because of its <u>atheistic element</u> has more aql (reason) than a thousand apes like him who claim that the "science" which cannot ultimately prove God's existence is the same "science" that has allowed him and Dawkins to figure out the way man came to be!    <P>
<b>Eight:</b> He says a little later:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>One problem is that many Muslims retain the simple picture that God created Adam from clay, much as a potter makes a statue, and then breathed into the lifeless statue and lo! it became a living human. This is a children's madrasa-level understanding and Muslims really have to move on as adults and intellectuals, especially given the very serious scientific heritage of the medieval Islamic civilisation.</blockquote>    <P>
This is revilement upon the Book of Allaah (and likewise upon the Sunnah), and it is mockery too, and it is a revilement upon the generality of the Muslims who believed in what their Lord revealed to them, and it is feared upon the heart of this mulabbis kadhhaab that it has been sealed and forsaken wal-iyaadhu billaah! That which he calls "<i>one problem</i>" and which he refers to as "<i>a children's madrasa-level understanding</i>" is really directed to the speech of Allaah the Exalted, in that the most that was necessary from Allaah's knowledge to be conveyed to us to achieve the desired objective (behind imparting that information) is that Aadam was made from the dust of the earth, made into clay, or mud, and formed accordingly, and then Allaah breathed into him from His spirit and "<i>lo! a human being came to be!</i>" [Usamah's sarcasm and mockery]. We are likewise informed that the Jinn are made from smokeless fire and the Angels from light, without any further detail. You have to connect this matter to what was stated at the beginning in the first point regarding the types of knowledge, that Allaah has not obliged us to know how, in all its detail, how Adam came to be, and nor is it from the type of knowledge which if one does not know that one becomes backward and illiterate. Indeed, it is from Allah's wisdom to tell us that Adam was made from earth and the Jinn were made from smokeless fire and the Angels from light <u>at the specific level of detail</u> that He did. So the point here is that <u>this nothing short of mockery</u> of the revealed texts in that they offer no more than <i>a children's madrasah level of understanding</i>. Usamah shares the sentiments of <a href='../tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> like Dawkins who want Muslim children to progress beyond this "madrasah level" of "<i>lo! and it became a human being</i>" and enter into knowledge which aside from being speculation, is neither obligatory, nor recommended and nor is one sinful or disadvantaged in any way for not knowing it.  </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Coming Next:</b> This article is really just a warm up, the meat and bones haven't arrived yet, and we wanted just to make some high-level observations at this point in terms of how Usamah Hasan is "aligning" and "positioning" himself in the scheme of things. From here we will proceed to explain how Usamah Hasan is really bringing kalaam and falsafah to the table and not actual science, since science and reason is in one valley and Usamah is in another.</div>    <P>
