<b>[The Chain of Narration:]</b>    <P>
No. 2180: 'Alee ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullaah narrated to us that Ismaa'eel ibn Muhammad narrated to us and said: Yoonus ibn Muhammad narrated to us and said: Mu'tamar ibn Sulaimaan narrated to us that: may father narrated to us from Yahyah ibn Ya'mar from Ibn 'Umar who said: I heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We were sitting with Allaah's Messenger (salallaahu 'alaihi wassallam) amongst the people when a man entered; there was not upon him any signs of journeying and he was not from the people of this land; he walked until he knelt down in front of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu 'alaihi wassallam) just as one of us would sit for the prayer. He then placed his hands upon the knees of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu 'alaihi wassallam), and said:     <P>
"O Muhammad. What is Islaam?"     <P>
He replied: "Islaam is that you testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; that you establish the Prayer; that you pay the Zakaat; that you perform Hajj and 'Umrah; that you make ghusl (i.e. take a ritual bath) after sexual relations; that you perfect wudhoo (ablution); that you fast the month of Ramadhaan."    <P>
He (the man) said: "If I do this, then I am a Muslim?"    <P>
He replied: "Yes."    <P>
He (the man) said: "You have spoken the truth, O Muhammad."     <P>
He then asked: "What is Imaan?"    <P>
He replied: <b>"Imaan is that you believe in <u>Allaah</u>, in his <u>Angels</u>, in his <u>Books</u> and in his<u> Messengers</u>; that you believe in <u>Paradise</u>, <u>Hell</u>, the <u><a href='tags/scales.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Scales</font></a></u> (<a href='tags/al-meezaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/meezaan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Meezaan</font></a></font></a>); that you believe in the <u>Resurrection</u> after death; that you believe in <u><a href='tags/al-qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/qadar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">qadar</font></a></font></a></u> (the Pre-Decree), it's good and it's evil."</b>    <P>
He (the man) said: "If I do this, then I am considered  a believer (mu'min)?"    <P>
He replied: "Yes."    <P>
He (the man) said: "You have spoken the truth."  </blockquote>    <P>
As for this narration: Imaam Muslim alluded to it from this route and the hadeeth (see &#1581;-8) has been reported by Muslim through a number of [other] routes: (&#1581;8-10) and other than it with various wordings.     <P>
