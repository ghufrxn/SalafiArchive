<div class='sidebar'>We received a question through email at the <a href=http://www.asharis.com/>Asharis.Com</a> website, but it is more suited for this website. This is part of what is in the email regarding the title subject:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Could you please answer this question? Are all <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> Jahmiyyah? And how do you respond to someone who might claim that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> never referred to the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> as a group to be Jahmiyyah? Is this correct? And how would you understand the statements of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> which appear in Majmu al-Fatawa at 3/99, 17/73, 6/529, 12/522 about the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> being from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. Could you please elaborate as I read a discussion on a website where it was said that you cannot call all <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> to be <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, only some of them.</b></blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Answer</font>    <P>
This is a very good and important question, and has associated with it lots of benefits. As for the answer, <u>then every Mu'tazilee is a Jahmee, but not every Jahmee is a Mu'tazilee</u>. Upon this principle, the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, in their entirety, as a group are amongst the various groups who enter into the genus of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is an umbrella term.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/mutazilah-jahmiyyah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In the first diagram, the circle represents the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and many factions enter into it. They became <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> as a result of adopting one of the usool of al-Jahm bin Safwaan. And the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> became <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> referred to them and labelled them as <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and his debates were with numerous factions who had different <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, those who were <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and those who were Murji'ah, and he labelled all of them as <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. It is a mistaken notion that he debated "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>". Rather he debated factions from all backgrounds, and those who instigated this fitnah would encourage the figureheads of 'ilm al-kalaam from <u>all backgrounds or persuasions</u> to come and debate him. <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> labelled all of them as <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
Shaykh al-Islaam bin Taymiyyah said in Minhaj al-Sunnah (tahqiq Muhammad Rashid Salim, 1986, 2/603-604):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/mutazilah-jahmiyyah-ibn-tay.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah did not agree with them [those inviting to  <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> in negating the attributes] and they were threatened, some of them with death, and others were arrested, punished and taken, with the use of instilling fear, apprehension. Imaam <a href='tags/ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a> remained firm upon that matter [of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the attributes] until they imprisoned him for a period. Then they requested their associates to debate him, yet they were cut off (in debate) with him, day after day, and they never brought anything that obligated his agreeement with them. Rather, he made clear their mistake in what they mentioned of evidences. And they had requested the leading scholars of kalaam, from the people of Basrah and others, such as Eesaa Muhammad bin Eesaa Burghuth, the associate of Husayn al-Najjaar and his likes. <b>And the debate was not only with the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> alone. <u>Rather, it was with the genus of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Najjaariyyah and Diraariyyah, and the various factions of the Murji'ah. For every Mu'tazilee is a Jahmee but not every Jahmee is a Mu'tazilee</u>, however <a href='tags/jahm.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahm</font></a> is the most severe in ta'teel (divestment) because he negated the names and attributes, and the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> negate the attributes and not the names. And <a href='tags/bishr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bishr</font></a> <a href='tags/al-mareesee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Mareesee</font></a> was from the Murji'ah, he was not from the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, rather he was from the senior ones amongst the Jahmiyyah</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
So this is an explicit text from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that every Mu'tazilee is a Jahmee, so whoever claimed other than that from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> has erred upon <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and has not grasped his sayings. Thus, factions can be <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> on account of a saying, even if they differ with each other on other sayings and what unites them is something from the usool of al-Jahm bin Safwaan and the first <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
As for the statements referred to in Majmu' al-Fataawa (12/522) wherein <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> makes a statement such as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - from amongst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and others  [and also] And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - from amongst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, the Philosophers and others... </blockquote>    <P>
Then these are very clear, because we already established from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are many different factions, even the Philosophers are <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>. In these types of statements, he does not mean "<i>The <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> amongst the Mu'tazilah</i>", this is a clear reversal of his words, he means "<i>And the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - under which come the likes of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> groups and others</i>", because the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are a genus, a general group, and what enters a faction amongst the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> is a saying amongst the sayings of al-Jahm, except that <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> <u>has degrees and levels</u>, some of it is more severe than others. So the <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> of al-Jahm is more severe than the <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>. And amongst the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> there are factions, some of their <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> is more severe than that of others. But they are all <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So this is how the speech of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is to be understood and this in fact was the view and position of the Salaf. And it is feared that perhaps these types of differentiations are being made these days in order to prevent the right labels being attached to factions and groups who are upon misguidance and deviation, and to prevent warning against them and their books and their <a href='tags/innovations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovations</font></a>, or to grant them ease, or affectionate speech and Allaah knows best. Because if we open this door of saying "<i>They only speak with <u>one or some of the sayings</u> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and not <u>all the sayings</u> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and hence, they are not Jahmiyyah</i>" then this is misrepresenting the way of the Salaf and of the Scholars and making a small opening in the door of ease, affection and nearness to the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and their books. The way of the Salaf is extremely clear, it is as clear as broad daylight, so it is not permissible for anyone to start inventing new understandings and claiming that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> did not say this or did not say that.    <P>
<blockquote>As for the works of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, then one has to understand that with his encyclopaedic knowledge, Ibn Taymiyyah's writings are often from the perspective of providing comprehensive analysis, from the point of view of a neutral-objective, detailed historical study of sects and individuals, and he would give each one his due right. This is different to the context of warning from innovation. In fact <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> often says "And these are the ones that the Salaf condemned...", and "This is the view, and its people, that the Salaf condemned and declared as <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>..." and so on, although he himself may not have expressed such rebuke or censure. So Ibn Taymiyyah's writings often are encyclopaedic, neutral, analytical writings, and if he took a conciliatory tone, or mentioned good about certain people, this does not mean that that is the ruling, view and practice of the Salaf towards such people, because there are two different contexts here, one which is a biographical, historical, analytical, comprehensive account for the purposes of establishing historical fact and analysis of it, and the other which warning from innovation and its people and their books and protecting the beliefs of the Muslims.    <P>
And indeed we saw over the last few decades, the Ikhwanis innovate new principles, such as that of <u>al-Muwaazanah</u> (mentioning the good alongside the bad so as not to oppress the one being spoken of) and they would often argue through the writings of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, whose context and perspective they do not understand. To illustrate, from a biographical perspective, much good has been said about al-Baqillani (d. 403H) the Ashari scholar, by the later biographers and by <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. However, put him in the time of Imaams Malik, Shafi'i or <a href='tags/ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad</font></a> and Allaah knows best how they would have dealt with him because he was <u>a head from the heads of the censurerd ilm al-kalaam (that of al-ajsaam and al-'araad)</u>. Just consider the action of <a href='tags/imaam-ahmad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam <a href="tags/ahmad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ahmad</font></a></font></a> with al-Muhasibi, Ibn Kullab and al-Karaabeesee, and the many sayings of Shafi'ee about ilm al-kalaam and its people. Now, that's al-Baqillani, Allaah knows best what they would have done with some of the later Ash'arites in whose books, speech and opinion appeared the views of the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and falsafah, zandaqah and something of the approaches of the Baatiniyyah, let alone the condemned ilm al-kalaam! So you get the idea.</blockquote></div>    <P>
The Salaf said "Whoever denied there is a Lord above the Throne is a Jahmee." <u>This means what it says</u>. Whoever denied there is a Lord above the Throne is a Jahmee, irrespective of his other beliefs, and the Salaf did not mean, "He only has a view amongst the views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and not all the views of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and therefore is not a Jahmee" rather they meant what they actually said, anyone who denied there is a Lord above the Throne, <u>is a Jahmite</u> - <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/series/the-salaf-who-figured-out-and-exposed-the-greatest-goal-of-the-jahmites.cfm>see their statements here</a>. We also see Ibn Battah (d. 377H), in his book, which is part of al-Ibaanah al-Kubraa, "<i>al-Radd alal-Jahmiyyayh</i>", he is actually refuting the <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, and he says therein that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are sunoof (various factions), and then he lists all their various sayings, and likewise the Shafi'i scholar Abu al-Husayn al-Malatiyy (d. 387H) in his book <i>al-Tanbih wal-Radd alaa Ahl al-Ahwaa wal-Bida'</i> divides them into eight factions and mentions all their sayings, even though his list is not comprehensive.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion and Summary</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> are the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and "<a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a>" is a generic label which includes a variety of factions, and they enter into this label if they adopt and speak with the something from the usool of al-Jahm, and their also degrees and variations in <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a>, from severe, to light. Further, it is not necessitated that when a person is referred to as a "Jahmee" or is said to have something of the usool of the Jahmites, that he is necessarily a kaafir. In a modern context, the level of knowledge amongst people has diminished, and the average person needs to be taught and educated. However, there are callers [posing as Ash'arites] who call to <a href='tags/tajahhum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tajahhum</font></a> and upon whom the hujjah needs to be established, and most of these people are not ignorant and stupid, they actually understand what they are doing.     <P>
