We would like to finish here with something from the Sunnah, a hadeeth through which an important point needs to be made, and then a couple of verdicts of the orthodox Muslim scholars on this matter.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari</font>    <P>
This is occurs in the <b>Book of the Prophets</b>, in the chapter <i>Allaah's <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of Aadam and his Offspring</i>:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah created Aadam with sixty-cubits [around 30 metres] in length. Then He said go and give salutations to those angels then listen to how they greet you [that being] the greeting of you and your offspring. So he said, "<i>As salaamu alaykum</i>" and they said, "<i>As salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaah</i>" and so they added "<i>wa rahmatullaah</i>." And everyone who enters Paradise will be upon the form of Aadam (in size), and the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> has never ceased to decrease [in size] till now.</blockquote>    <P>
From this hadeeth:    <P>
<blockquote>Allaah created Aadam from a collection of the dusts of the earth, and made him sixty-cubits in length. From his offspring (through the kawnee <a href='tags/asbaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>asbaab</font></a> which are the male and female fluids and a term in the womb) are people of different complexions, and they have never ceased decreasing in size till this ummah and the affair has remained established upon that. And this is simply an indication that Allaah placed inherent capacities and propensities within mankind through which the variation, richness and changes [in traits, features and qualities] take place, and which are determined by what is passed on from parent to child. And the same is said of the plants and animals and all living things. They were created in complete functional forms, giving their form of <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> and then guided as to their mode, progeny and so on, and Allaah has written all things in the Preserved Tablet. So we affirm Allaah's <a href='tags/qadar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>qadar</font></a>, qadaa, taqdeer, khalq <u>and</u> the <a href='tags/asbaab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>asbaab</font></a> that Allaah has placed in His <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>, and we believe in all of that together. And it is a well known established principle with Ahl al-Sunnah that sound, uncorrupted reason (aql sareeh) does not conflict with an authentic text (naql saheeh), and where it does, then the reason (aql) needs to be re-evaluated. So the revealed texts are true and they explain the truth and what they contain concords with and is in perfect agreement with reality, as it is all from the knowledge of Allaah, the Exalted. As for mankind, then they have been given little knowledge, and so they attempt to find answers, with whatever tools they have at their disposal, and even that does not allow them to know except very little. And in <a href='tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a>, the greatest of tyrants, arrogants and their likes who opposed the Prophets and Messengers, had whatever sciences and knowledge through which they tried to reject what is firmly rooted in their fitrah.  And today things are no different, except that we have a much higher level of sophistication and subtlety which sits on top of the underlying kibr (arrogance), takhdeeb (denial), juhood (rejection). This sophistication [in giving the illusion of true scientific enquiry] is being driven by these types of <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, and these in turn sit on top of that fitrah, concealing it, and repressing it. All of these <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> today are very explicit in saying <a href='tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> is the biggest driver to <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a>, it is what Dawkins said drove him to <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a> and made him take up his lifelong mission of fighting against belief in God, and these are the types of people Usamah Hasan is sharing sentiments with, against the Muslims, as it relates to <a href='tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
From what has preceded in this series, it is <u>impossible</u> to reconcile <a href='tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> with the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah, and any attempt to reconcile comprises takdheeb of Allaah (the Qur'an) and of the Messenger (the Sunnah), <u>by absolute necessity</u>, whether one realizes it or not, and this is what the orthodox Scholars of <a href='tags/islaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islaam</font></a> have stated:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Rulings of the Scholars on The One Who Believes Man Descended From Apes</font>    <P>
There occurs in the <i>Fataawaa Nur Alaa al-Darb</i> (1/83-85) a fatwa of Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah) in response to a question posed about the belief that man used to be an ape in the beginning and then gradually evolved and changed into a man. The fatwa <a href=http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=29&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=5>can be found here</a>.    <P>
From the answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This statement which the questioner has mentioned is rejected (munkar) false (baatil) saying that is in opposition to the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<i>alayhis salaatu was salaam</i>) and the consensus of the Salaf of the Ummah... it is obligatory that a servant believe that the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of Aadam is other than the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of apes, and that the origin of [the son of] Aadam is the origin  that he is upon now, and his origin is not of apes or other than them.  Rather, he is a a human fashioned upon his form that is witnessed. So the statement that his origin is from apes is a rejected saying, a false saying. Rather, if <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a> was ascribed to the one saying it, it would be appropriate, and what is most apparent, and Allaah knows best, is that whoever says it alongside his knowledge of what the legislation came with, then he is a kaafir (disbeliever), because he belies (mukadhdhib) Allaah and His Messenger and belies the Book of Allaah in the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> of Aadam.</blockquote>    <P>
And also the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) in response to a questioner who said he studied in a book of <a href='tags/history.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>history</font></a> that man's origin is from apes, and with the passing of time he changed into a human. The answer <a href=http://www.ibnothaimeen.com/all/noor/article_9211.shtml>can be found here</a>.    <P>
From the answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This statement is not correct, I mean the saying that the origin of man is from apes, however the one speaking with this, he is in reality an ape, deformed in intellect and deformed in vision (insight), so it is befitting that we call him an ape, and he is not a human, even if he is in the form of a human... this saying that the origin of man is from apes is not correct and believing in it is <a href='tags/disbelief.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disbelief</font></a>, because it is rejection (takdheeb) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>...</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Final Comment</font>    <P>
It is obligatory upon Usamah Hasan to repent for his apparent mockery of the Qur'anic treatment of Aadam's <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> (it's too "<i>children's madrasah level</i>") and likewise his mockery of the Muslims at large for affirming their <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> in what Allaah revealed to them, and for rebuking them for not being acquainted with the speculative knowledge that Allaah has not praised and nor obligated and nor made to be advantageous in any way to a person's <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a> or entry into Paradise in Hellfire. Likewise, it is upon him to repent for aligning himself with the staunchest of <a href='tags/atheists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheists</font></a> like Dawkins in their resentment and lamentation that Muslims are taught <a href='tags/darwinism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Darwinism</font></a> is wrong, and claiming that Dawkins is "largely correct". Likewise, he needs to abandon the following of desires in trying to adduce "religious" proof in trying to merge between the greatest handhold of modern <a href='tags/atheism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>atheism</font></a> and the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, which he is doing by citing quotes which are not really in his favour, and that's besides the fact that they do not actually constitute "<u>religious proof</u>" at all, they are just expressions and opinions of a handful of people.    <P>
<blockquote>Lastly, there is a calamity greater than this one [i.e. Usamah Hasan's view], which is that the father, Suhaib Hasan, in what has been narrated by numerous witnesses, that on the evening of Friday 14/01/2011 at his mosque, claimed that because his son, Usamah, is a haafidh (memorizer) of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is better than most of the audience, and that because he has studied at a high level of science, the people do not really understand what Usamah is saying, and he invoked curses upon those who were involved in certain activities (distributing leaflets against Usamah and not praying behind Usamah). Now, we can't comment on the rights and wrongs as to how people may be handling any particular situation, <b>but the greater calamity here</b> is Usamah Hasan is calling to <u>that which is pure <a href='tags/kufr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>kufr</font></a>, and takdheeb of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and takdheeb of the Sunnah</u> (and he's using sarcastic language too against what is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and against the Muslims) yet his father, Suhaib Hasan, is essentially claiming that Usamah is much smarter than others who are not sophisticated enough to understand what he is saying! That's not the case, the Muslims know what Usamah is saying, it is plain kufr(!) <b>and it could not be any clearer from the verdicts of the Scholars on this matter</b>. And he is calling to it through radio broadcasts, press articles, signing declarations, attending conferences, making blog posts and so on, and he is doing a pretty good job of making efforts to get his message out. Indeed, the right course of action would be to <u>immediately remove</u> him from all tasks and duties to stop creating fitnah for the <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> and ibaadah of the congregation, clarify the truth of this matter openly with the verdicts of the scholars (like those quoted above) and then discipline him separately (upon what a father-son relationship requires). <i>On the contrary, what we see, hear and read is that the father is defending the right of the son to reach independent conclusions, sending faxes abroad, claiming his son is better educated than the rest of us dumb commoners and that we are not able to fathom what he is saying, and he is invoking curses on those from the congregation who are simply trying to safeguard their prayer</i>. To Allaah is the complaint! </blockquote>    <P>
