<font class='titleHeadline'>I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-manuscript.gif align=right hspace=4 border=0>The Book "I'tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah" (manuscript copy sample, first page, to the right) is authentically ascribed to <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, and it has been mentioned by Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) in his book "Aqeedat us-Salaf wa Ashaabil-Hadeeth", and likewise by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in "Jaami al-Uloom wal-Hikam", referring to it as "the risaalah of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> to the people of the mountain." The book has a connected chain of narration to its author and it has been narrated with its chain by Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi in "Dhamm ut-Ta'weel", ad-Dhahabi in "<a href="tags/al-uluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Uluww</font></a>", and in "Tadhkirat ul-Huffaadh" and "Siyar". And in his book "al-Arba'een Fee Sifaati Rabbil-Aalameen", adh-Dhahabee says, "And this <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> (al-mu'taqad), we have heard this from him with a saheeh isnaad (authentic chain of narration)" (p. 118). The book also has three hearings (samaa') in the years 574H, 617H, and 667H, the details of which are found in the manuscripts. So the book is firmly established and corroborated as being the work of <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>. In these articles we will be quoting from the tahqeeq of Jamaal Azzoon, first edition, 1999, Dar Ibn Hazm.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Brief Note Regarding <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> and the Contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Parading Under the Label of "Ash'ariyyah"</font>    <P>
We see these spurious, fraudulent lists of so called "Ash'ari" Scholars being circulated and spread on blogs and websites, with an impressive array of names mentioned therein, and Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee's name is often found in these lists. This is one of the greatest of frauds being perpetrated by the Jahmite Machinery that has taken on the label of "Ash'ariyyah" in the 20th and 21st century. Whilst this is not the place to digress away from the subject of this article, let it be known that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> was a Salafi, Sunni, Athari (all synonymous terms representing only one approach and one aqidah) and his <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> is in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> Ash'ariyyah. He affirmed Allaah's Uluww, with His Essence, affirmed the attributes of Face, Hands, Eyes, and affirms that the Names of Allaah are not created (unlike the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?msfeb>see here</a>), and affirmed that this <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us is uncreated, and opposes the Lafdhiyyah <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (i.e. Ash'ariyyah) who say that al-lafdh al-maqroo' is created (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?bxzbp>see here</a>). And he opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Ash'ariyyah on the subject of <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a>, affirming that it is belief and action, that it increases and decreases. And further he affirms the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a>, without takyeef or ta'weel or tafweed, on account of it being reported in the authentic narrations. Inshaa'Allaah these details of belief from <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> will be the subject of this series of articles. We demand the contemporary <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>to abide by the criterion</a> laid out <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ovpij>in this article</a> when imputing Ash'ariyyah to any Scholar.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Affirmation of Two Hands for Allaah Without Kayf (Asking How)</font>    <P>
Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/ismaaeelee-hands.gif border=0>    <P>
Which translates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And they [Ahl us-Sunnah] believe that Allaah, the Most High, is called upon with His Beautiful Names, described with His Attributes which He named and described Himself with, or [which] His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) described Him with.</blockquote>    <P>
In opposition to the heretical <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> has affirmed the principle of Ahl us-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf, the Ahl ul-Hadeeth wal-Athar, of affirming for Allaah what He affirmed for Himself and what the Messenger (alayhis salaam) affirmed for him in the authentic narrations. And we see that further on he affirms the <a href='tags/nuzool.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nuzool</font></a> (Descent) of Allaah, without kayf, indicating that he affirms the attributes which occur in the narrations, beyond that which is in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> alone.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He created Aadam with His Hand. And both His Hands are outstretched, He spends [of His Bounty] however He wills, without holding belief in a kayf...    <P>
...And He created Aadam (alayhis salaam) with His Hand. And both His Hands are outstretched, He spends [of His Bounty] however He wills without believing how His Hands are, since the Book of Allaah, the Most High, did not speak with a kayf (quiddity) regarding this.</blockquote>    <P>
This is the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of all of the Salaf, and the early Kullaabi Ash'aris, in opposition to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the later Ash'aris who reverted to many of the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Kafirs like Ibn Sina (d. 429H) on the subject of Allaah's uluww (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>) and likewise on the subject of the <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah such as Face, Hands, Eyes, the later Ash'arites spoke with the ta'weels of the Jahmites and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and opposed the early Kullaabi Ash'arites who affirmed these attributes without ta'weel and tafweed. To see how fraudulent the ascription of today's <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> to the early Kullaabi Ash'aris is, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?xsjgs>see this article</a> from Abu Bakr al-Baqillaani (d. 403H), perhaps the most instrumental person in the formalization and actual existence of what became known as "Ash'ariyyah" where he exposes the scandal of today's Jahmites posing under the label of "Ash'ariyyah", in their accusation of tajseem against Ahl us-Sunnah.    <P>
As for the negation of belief in a kayf, this is because Allaah has not revealed to us that knowledge, therefore it is impossible for us to hold a belief in a kayf, and thus while the existence of a reality (haqeeqah, kaifiyyah) for the attribute of two Hands is affirmed, knowledge of it is denied. And the affirmation of here by <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> is an affirmation of the actual existence of the attribute itself - not like the astray, deceiving, lying <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, who play and fool around and who say, "<i>We affirm the text of the attribute</i>", meaning by that that they affirm that the word "yad" is to be found in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>  - and that's it! Then it's either ta'weel (tahreef) or tafweed (tajheel)! And these Heretical Jahmites posing as "Ash'arites" are not upon what Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324H), Ibn Mahdee at-Tabari (d. 380H), Abu al-Abbaas al-Qalaanisee, Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (d. 403H), Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi (d. 458H) were upon (early Kullaabi Ash'aris - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.cfm>see this series of articles</a>) - and nor what the likes of Abu Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) and al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463H) were upon. For all of these Scholars affirmed these attributes as actual real attributes that exist, just like Allaah's essence exists, and whose meanings are known but for which any knowledge of the kaifiyyah is denied and for which resemblance and likeness to the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a> is denied.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is not to be believed regarding this (His Hands) that [they are] members and limbs, and nor [that they have] length and breadth, and nor thickness or thinness and what is similar to that from that whose like is found in the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>. For there is no likeness unto him, Blessed is the Face of our Lord, the possessor of majesty and honour.</blockquote>    <P>
Whilst this meaning is correct, the use of such specific negations opposes the methodology of the Book and the Sunnah since the Book and the Sunnah have come with <u>specific affirmation</u> and <u>general negation</u>, and the way of Ahl us-Sunnah is to say that we believe in such attributes whilst negating any likeness between them and the <a href='tags/creation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creation</font></a>. We can repeat here what has been said elsewhere (regarding Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi, d. 458H, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ezymy>see original article here</a>):    <P>
<blockquote>Though he affirms these as attributes of the essence (sifaat dhaatiyyah) in agreement with those who preceded, in his methodology however, he departs from the way of the Salaf in that he  makes <u>specific negations</u> that are not reported in the Book and the Sunnah. And the way of Ahl us-Sunnah is to affirm what Allaah affirmed for Himself in the Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger and to negate what He negated from Himself in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger. And in the Book and the Sunnah we find that <u>affirmation is very specific</u> and that <u>negation is done only generally</u>. So the way of Ahl us-Sunnah - in corroborrating and affirming their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> - is to adhere to that methodology and not to depart from it, this being a means of safety in their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and as a means of not speaking about Allaah with that which He did not speak about Himself, <u>whether in affirmation or negation</u>. Thus, it is not from the methodology of the Salaf to say, in negation, "His eye is not a pupil, and His hand is not a limb and His face is not a figure, or form". Rather they say, "<i>We affirm the attributes of face, hands and eyes and they are unlike the face, hands and eyes found in the creation</i>" - and between the two there is a clear difference. And we are speaking here as it relates to affirming and corroborating one's <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a>. And al-Bayhaqi, despite being affected by something of the kalaam and the ta'weel of the Mutakallimoon, is much better than those who came later and who simply adopted much of what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> were upon in this topic.</blockquote>    <P>
From what has preceded it is clear that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a>, like all of the Salaf, affirm the attributes of two Hands for Allaah, being opposed in that by none other than the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and the later Ash'arites who abandoned the <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> of the early Kullaabi Ash'arites and licked up to the denials and ta'weels of the Jahmites who preceded them in that by a few centuries - the very ones refuted by the Kullaabi Ash'arites and it is about time that this great fraud is made known to the world at large, so we ask Ahl us-Sunnah in all places and parts of the world, to print, copy, translate, spread the likes of these articles - for these Jahmites only gained ascendancy because of the laxity of Ahl us-Sunnah in speaking the truth and diligently propagating it amongst the people, without let or hindrance.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And let no Ash'arite think or claim, in his delusion, that <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> is in agreement with their <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> merely because he used the language of specific negation - and this is another one of the frauds of the Ash'arites in that a Scholar is considered to be "Ash'ari" merely because with respect to a particular attribute or two, he made specific specific negation.</div>    <P>
For the only difference between what <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> has said and what Ahl us-Sunnah, the Righteous Salaf say is that he made the negation of likeness to be in very specific language and this methodology is incorrect, whereas the Salaf made negation in general language - since that is more befitting, and closer to being a praise of Allaah, whereas specific negations, "He is not blind, He is not deaf, He does not have pupils, He does not have limbs, He does not have this..." and so on - is not from the methodology of revelation - rather that is the way of the Philosophers.    <P>
And whilst the intent of a group of Scholars who used this language was to refute the likes of the Karraamiyyah Mujassimah, they opposed the sound and correct methodology in doing so in this particular manner - for it is not the way of the Salaf to make these specific negations, rather they adhere to the affirmations in the Book and the Sunnah whilst denying tamtheel and tashbeeh from what they affirm.    <P>
At-Tirmidhee (d. 279H) said in his Sunan (1/128-129), mentioning the Ijmaa' of Ahl us-Sunnah, almost two-hundred years before the "Ash'arites" were even known as a faction:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It has been stated by more than one person from the People of Knowledge about such ahaadeeth, that there is no tashbeeh (resemblance) to the Attributes of Allaah, and our Lord - the Blessed and Most High - descends to the lowest heaven every night. So they say: "Affirm these narrations, have <a href='tags/eemaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Eemaan</font></a> (<a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>faith</font></a>) in them, do not deny them, nor ask how." The likes of this has been related from Maalik ibn Anas, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, Ibn Uyainah and Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak, who all said about such ahaadeeth: "Leave them as they are, without asking how." Such is the saying of the People of Knowledge from the Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah. However, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> oppose these narrations and say: This is tashbeeh! <b>However, Allaah the Most High, has mentioned in various places in His Book, the Attribute of al-Yad (Hand), as-Sama' (Hearing), and al-Basr (Seeing) - but the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> make ta'weel of these aayaat, explaining them in a way, other than how they are explained by the People of Knowledge</b>. They say: Indeed, Allaah did not create Aadam with His own Hand - they say that Hand means the Power of Allaah. Ishaaq ibn Ibraheem [ar-Raahawaih] said:     <P>
<blockquote>Tashbeeh is if it is said: "Hand like my hand, or similar to my hand", or it is said: "Hearing like my Hearing,or similar to my hearing", then this is tashbeeh. But if what is being said is what Allah has said: Hand, Hearing, Seeing and it is not asked how, nor is it said: "Like my hearing, or similar to my hearing" - then it is not tashbeeh. Allaah, the Most Blessed, Most High, said in His Book (ash-Shooraa 42:11):   "<b>There is none like unto Him, and he is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing</b>" </blockquote> </blockquote>     <P>
As for the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a> and Later Ash'ariyyah (with respect to these particular <a href='tags/sifaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat</font></a> dhaatiyyah, Face, Hands, Eyes), then their way is miles apart from what Imaams like <a href='tags/abu-bakr-al-ismaaeelee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Bakr al-Ismaa'eelee</font></a> (rahimahullaah) were upon. For they take these texts of the attributes away from their dhaahir meanings to other meanings for which Allaah sent down no knowledge to them as to their correctness or incorrectness. And it was these people that the Salaf were referring to when they said, "bilaa ma'naa", "bilaa tafseer", (without meaning, and without explanation) - for these <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> were inventing explanations (ta'weels), trying to say about these Attributes what Allaah had not revealed, neither in His Book and nor in the Sunnah. And others amongst them, after rejecting the apparent meanings then claimed Allaah knows best what this word "yad" actually means (tafweed). All of this is other than what the Salaf and the early Kullaabi Ash'arites were upon. <P>
