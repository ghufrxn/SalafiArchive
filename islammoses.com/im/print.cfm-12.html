The religion of Banī Isrā'īl was that of their forefather, Ibrahīm (alayhis salām), it was Islām, Tawḥīd, Hanīfiyyah. Ya'qūb was the son of Isḥāq (alayhis salām), the son of Ibrāhīm (alayhis salām), and is given the title of Asīr ʾīl (Servant of God), or Isrāʾīl. He gave birth to the Twelve Tribes (Asbāt) through his twelve sons. They were upon Islām and Allāh raised them over other nations due to their uprightness and firmness upon Tawhīd in that period of time. <b><a href="dld-11.cfm?a=ictvbd">Download PDF</a></b>. </div>  <br>  <a href="dld-11.cfm?a=ictvbd"><img src="assets/images/banee-israaeel-01.PNG" border="0"></a>   <p>
