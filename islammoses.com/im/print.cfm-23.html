<p>Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah said:    <p>
<blockquote><p>It is known that prior to the sending of Muḥammad (sallallāhu ʿalayhi wasallam), the authority of the Children of Ishmael was not above the authority of the Children of Isaac. Rather, Prophethood and the [revelation of the] Book was among the Children of Isaac. They had entered Miṣr (Egypt) with Jacob in the era of Joseph, and the Children of Ishmael were not above them. Then they left (Miṣr) when <a href='tags/moses.cfm-1.html'><font class='tagLnk'>Moses</font></a> was sent (as a Messenger), and in the presence of <a href='tags/moses.cfm-1.html'><font class='tagLnk'>Moses</font></a> they were the mightiest of the people of the Earth. No one had any authority over them, and thereafter, the same with Joshua, until the era of David, and in the dominion of Solomon, the likes of whose kingdom none was given after him.     <p>
After that Nebuchadnezzar was unleashed upon them, and the Children of Ishmael did not have any authority above them. Then the Messiah was sent, and Bayt al-Maqdis was ruined and sacked for a second time, wherein they [the Children of Israel] had caused corruption on the earth a second time. And from that time onwards, their kingdom ceased, and Allāh split and dispersed them across the earth as small nations. They had been under the rule of Romans and the Persians, and still the Arabs did not have any rule over them, greater than what others had over them. The offspring of Ishmael did not have authority over any of the nations, neither the People of the Book nor the unlettered (Pagan Arabs).  Hence, the offspring of Ishmael did not have any authority over them until Allāh sent Muḥammad (sallallāhu ʿalayhi wasallam), the one for whom Abraham and Ishmael had invoked, when they said: "<b>O our Lord, raise a messenger from among them who will rehearse your signs upon them, and teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them. Indeed you are the all-Mighty, the all-Wise</b>."(2:129).</p></blockquote>    <p>
